A 62-year-old woman presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and bilateral upper extremity edema. She had been diagnosed one year previously with stage IVB lung adenocarcinoma with bilateral malignant pleural effusion, and metastatic lesions in both lungs, the left supraclavicular lymph node, right temporal lobe, and right ribs. Genetic analysis of cells from pleural effusion revealed an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) point mutation at exon 21 (L858R). She was treated with gefitinib, and her CEA level decreased from 931.7 to 20.3 ng/ml with treatment. Assessment of lung cancer and metastatic lesions after gefitinib treatment showed marked reduction except for bilateral pleural effusion. She has a 40 pack-year smoking history. Chest CT findings show lung cancer had markedly reduced but pleural effusion remained. Initial vital signs were: heart rate, 85 bpm; blood pressure, 110/60 mmHg; temperature, 37.4 \u00b0C; respiratory rate, 24 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation, 94% on room air. Physical examination revealed edema of the bilateral upper extremities, dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds bilaterally in the thorax, and bilateral digital clubbing. Labs showed: WBC 8820/mm3 with a left shift; hemoglobin 12.4 g/dl; platelets 182,000/mm3; random serum glucose 111 mg/dl; LDH 204 U/l; AST 18 U/l; ALT 11 U/l; albumin 3.1 g/dl; BUN 19 mg/dl; creatinine 0.8 mg/dl; CRP 0.24 mg/dl; BNP 6.1 pg/ml.
