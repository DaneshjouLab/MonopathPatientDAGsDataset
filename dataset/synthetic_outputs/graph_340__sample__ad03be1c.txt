A 44-year-old man was diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (cT4N2M0, stage IIIB) one year prior to admission due to a persistent cough. A tumor was discovered in the right lung. The patient declined bronchoscopy for histological examination or chemotherapy and underwent radiation therapy alone (60 Gy to the primary tumor and adjacent mediastinal lymph nodes, 50 Gy to the right hilum). Eight months later, regrowth of the primary tumor in the right lung occurred, accompanied by intrapulmonary metastasis. Transbronchial biopsy with bronchoscopy confirmed the NSCLC diagnosis, with no mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor or anaplastic lymphoma kinase genes. Programmed cell death-ligand 1 staining tumor proportion score was >50%. The patient received three courses of chemotherapy: carboplatin (AUC 5) and paclitaxel (200 mg/m3) every three weeks. Pembrolizumab (200 mg/body) was added to the fourth course of chemotherapy one month before admission. On admission, the patient's body temperature was 36.8Â°C, and chest radiography showed no new lesions. The patient underwent the fifth course of immunochemotherapy as scheduled (pembrolizumab, carboplatin, paclitaxel).
