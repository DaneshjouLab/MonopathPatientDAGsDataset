A patient with either leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, or small cell lung carcinoma (including metastatic small cell lung cancer) presented with findings indicative of bulky disease, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, and elevated white blood cell counts, suggesting a high tumor burden and high proliferation rates. The patient developed Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS), an oncologic emergency, characterized by metabolic acidosis, hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperkalemia, and hypocalcemia, representing electrolyte abnormalities. This occurred in the context of chemotherapy or other cytotoxic treatment for hematologic malignancies or solid tumors. The patient experienced renal compromise and abdominal organ involvement. Management included bicarbonate, rasburicase, allopurinol, and calcium replacement to address the metabolic derangements. Continuous renal replacement therapy was considered. The severity of TLS was likely assessed using the Cairo and Bishop classification. Ultimately, comfort care was provided, suggesting a poor prognosis.
