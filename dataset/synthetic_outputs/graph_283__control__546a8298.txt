We encountered a 40-year-old female patient who, after resection of lung adenocarcinoma followed by adjuvant chemotherapy, developed a series of metastatic events. Initially, she developed carcinomatous pleuritis and lymphangitis. In October 2012, positron emission tomography (PET), performed due to right supraclavicular lymph node swelling, revealed multiple lymph node metastases not only in the right supraclavicular region but also in the bilateral lung hilus and mediastinum. Concomitantly, bilateral malignant pleural effusion and carcinomatous lymphangioma in the left lower lobe were detected. In November 2012, the patient was treated with the oral administration of crizotinib at a dose of 250 mg twice per day. In May 2015, the disease progressed with the appearance of multiple brain metastases and spinal metastasis associated with central nervous system (CNS) symptoms. Craniotomy was conducted for surgical removal of cerebellar metastasis followed by gamma knife radiosurgery for 8 residual brain metastases. Radiotherapy was also administered for the spinal metastasis. Later, the patient developed intramedullary spinal cord metastases.
