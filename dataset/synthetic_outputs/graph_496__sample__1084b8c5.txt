In February 2021, a 59-year-old woman with a never smoking history presented with a 2.7 x 3.0 cm left lower lobe (LLL) mass. A PET scan revealed avidity in the LLL mass (SUV 6.8 units) and regional lymph nodes (LNs) (SUV 3.1–4.9 units). Brain MRI was negative for metastatic disease. Biopsies revealed poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with metastasis to the pleura, stage cT3N2M1a/IVa. In March 2021, the patient started carboplatin, paclitaxel, and pembrolizumab. A chest CT on completion of four cycles revealed that the LLL mass had decreased to 1.5 × 1.4 cm. The mass was consolidated with 50 Gy of radiation. A chest CT 3 months after radiation revealed that the LLL mass increased to 2.0 cm with new left hilar lymphadenopathy. In December 2021, nivolumab was started. After 3 months of nivolumab, a chest CT revealed that the LLL mass had increased to 3.4 cm with new left infrahilar adenopathy. A biopsy of the LLL mass revealed aBRD2::NUTM1 gene fusion was identified by RNA-based next-generation sequencing (NGS). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for NUT was positive, altering the diagnosis to NUT carcinoma. In May 2022, docetaxel and ramucirumab were started. In September 2022, a chest CT revealed a stable LLL mass after 4 months of docetaxel and ramucirumab.
