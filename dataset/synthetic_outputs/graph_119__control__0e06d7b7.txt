A patient presented with endometrial cancer, which was treated with a total hysterectomy and double appendages removal. Pathological examination revealed endometrial adenocarcinoma. Subsequently, the patient underwent thoracoabdominal CT and bone scan, revealing a diaphragmatic tumor and bone metastasis, indicating metastasis to the pelvic lymph nodes. A video-assisted thoracoscopy was performed, followed by a thoracotomy to address a tumor involving the pericardium, lower lobe of the right lung, and diaphragm. During the procedure, bleeding was encountered, and the diaphragm was repaired with a Dacron patch. Morphological examination and immunohistochemistry were performed, revealing estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor positivity. The patient experienced a tumor relapse, with diaphragmatic metastasis. The patient's case was further complicated by the differential diagnosis of primary tumors including lung cancer, malignant mesothelioma, malignant thymoma, and ovarian cancer. Ultimately, metastases were found in the lungs. The patient also had a history of benign endometriosis.
