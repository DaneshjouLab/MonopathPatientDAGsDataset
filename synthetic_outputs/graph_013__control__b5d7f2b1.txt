A patient with advanced-stage lung carcinoma presented with neurological symptoms. The primary concern was differentiating between stroke and brain metastasis. Metastasis, particularly to the brain, is a significant contributor to mortality and morbidity in advanced lung cancer, often rendering the disease incurable upon discovery. The clinical course involved repeated evaluations to distinguish between stroke and brain metastasis, as both conditions can present with similar neurological deficits. The diagnostic and therapeutic approach focused on differentiating these two conditions to optimize treatment strategies.
