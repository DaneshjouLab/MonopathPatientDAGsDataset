The patient presented with symptoms of intracranial hypertension, including nausea and vomiting. Brain MRI suggested leptomeningeal metastases. Further investigation with a lumbar puncture and cerebrospinal fluid cytology confirmed the diagnosis of leptomeningeal metastases. An Ommaya reservoir was installed for treatment delivery. Genetic testing revealed the patient harbored both EGFR and somatic BRCA2 mutations. Initial monotherapy with Olaparib resulted in a durable response lasting approximately 21 months. The treatment sequence was escalated to combination therapy with intrathecal chemotherapy, and eventually a triple combination of Olaparib, Furmonertinib, and intrathecal chemotherapy. Intrathecal pemetrexed 50mg every 4 weeks was administrated since October 2021. By October 25, 2021, the patient's symptoms of leptomeningeal metastases worsened dramatically, including lethargy, unresponsiveness, difficulty in eating and swallowing, necessitating intravenous nutritional support. The patient's ECOG performance status (PS) declined to 4. A CSF ctDNA Assay on October 25, 2021, showed EGFR p.L858R AF(9.7%), BRCA2 p.L2368Ffs*24 AF(6.3%), and TSC2 p.F897L.
