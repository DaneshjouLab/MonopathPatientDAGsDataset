A 71-year-old male presented with space-occupying lesions in the left hilar region during a routine annual examination. A needle biopsy performed on July 17, 2020, confirmed lung squamous cell carcinoma with positive CK5/6 and P40 expression. The patient had a 3-year history of primary hypertension, managed with indapamide 2.5 mg daily, maintaining a blood pressure of 140/90 mm.

A chest CT (plain + enhanced) prior to Hg. Endostar treatment revealed: patchy density shadow in the left lung; left lung lesions with exudative changes; enlarged lymph nodes with marked enhancement in the mediastinum near the aortic arch; a massive space-occupying lesion of the left hilar mass; a lumpy soft tissue-like density shadow with an unclear boundary and pleural adhesion at the level of the tracheal bifurcation, showing inhomogeneous enhancement after contrast; and an enlarged left supraclavicular lymph node with slight enhancement post-contrast.

The patient underwent 4 cycles of chemotherapy with albumin-bound paclitaxel 300mg on day 1 and cisplatin injection 30 mg from days 1 to 3, resulting in significant lesion reduction in the left lung, indicating partial remission. The family opted for surveillance every 3 months, rather than continuing chemotherapy.

In July 2021, a CT scan revealed lesion progression in the left lung, leading to conformal intensity-modulated radiation therapy for the left lung.

In October 2021, the patient was admitted for further maintenance therapy. A lung CT and electrocardiogram indicated an enlarged cardiac silhouette and minimal pericardial and left pleural effusion. Physical examination revealed that the breath sounds of both lungs were clear, there was no engorgement of the external jugular vein, and no clear contraindications to treatment.
