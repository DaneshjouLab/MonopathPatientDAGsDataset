A 44-year-old man with non-small cell lung cancer developed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia during immunochemotherapy consisting of carboplatin, paclitaxel, and pembrolizumab. One year before admission, a right lung tumor was discovered when he visited a clinic due to persistent cough. Eight months later, regrowth of the primary tumor in the right lung occurred, accompanied by intrapulmonary metastasis. He experienced low-grade fever, followed by mild hypoxemia, and febrile neutropenia. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was administered until the recovery of neutropenia, when he developed a high fever, severe hypoxemia, and hypotension accompanied by consolidation in the bilateral lungs. There was no hypoxemia or clinical symptoms other than low-grade fever until day 9, when he developed high fever and mild hypoxemia (percutaneous oxygen saturation, 93%), neutropenia (91/mm3), thrombocytopenia. Post-COVID-19 organizing pneumonia during cancer immunochemotherapy can be aggravated by immune-checkpoint inhibitors and G-CSF.
