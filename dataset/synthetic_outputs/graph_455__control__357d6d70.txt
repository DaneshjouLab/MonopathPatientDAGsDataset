Subsequently, a total thyroidectomy was performed. The patient was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma, which led to metastatic disease. The patient underwent thoracoscopic and cervical resection, as well as a right video-assisted thoracoscopic procedure. Definitive chemotherapy was administered for the lung adenocarcinoma.
