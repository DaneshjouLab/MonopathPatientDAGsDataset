An 8-year-old Saanen goat doe, a healthy control and breeding animal in eastern Washington State, USA, maintained in an indoor/outdoor animal housing facility, presented with a two-day history of reduced appetite, reduced fecal and urine output, increased heart rate, and intermittent bluish-grey discoloration of the mucous membranes. The animal was current on annual immunization for *Clostridium perfringens* Types C and D and *C. tetani* (BarVac CD/T) and on endo-/ectoparasite control when indicated by fecal and physical examinations [anthelmintics: fenbendazole or ivermectin; *Eimeria* control: amprolium; chewing lice infestation: coumaphos or permethrin]. Serology for *Coxiella burnetii* (last trimester of pregnancy) and small ruminant lentivirus were consistently negative over the life of this animal and herd.

On examination, the goat was bright, alert, and responsive, with pink, but tacky, mucous membranes. She was thin in body condition and the abdominal contour appeared bilaterally sunken. Rectal temperature was 39.9°C, heart rate was 156 beats/min, and respiratory rate was 56 breaths/min. A mild, bilateral, dry nasal discharge was noted. Thoracic auscultation revealed reduced sounds on the left side.

A subsequent examination revealed a rectal temperature of 39.1°C, heart rate of 120 beats/min, respiratory rate of 36 breaths/min, and expiratory abdominal effort.

Further examination revealed reduced and firm rumen fill and reduced rumen contractility. The packed cell volume (PCV) was 45% (RR: 22 to 38%). Plasma fibrinogen was 2 g/L (RR: 1 to 4 g/L). Serum chemistry panel revealed mild hyperproteinemia at 76 g/L (RR: 61 to 71 g/L) characterized by a low normal albumin at 26 g/L (RR: 25 to 35 g/L) and mild hyperglobulinemia at 50 g/L (RR: 27 to 41 g/L).
