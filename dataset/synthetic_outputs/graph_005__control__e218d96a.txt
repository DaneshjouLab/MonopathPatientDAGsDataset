The patient was diagnosed with stage IIIA lung adenocarcinoma (cT1cN2M0). The right upper lobe of the lung was positive for TTF-1, NpA, CK7, CD5/6 and Ki67 (60%); and negative for p40, p63 and CD56. Targeted NGS analysis of his lung lesion biopsy identified an EGFR G719X mutation with a mutant allele frequency (MAF) of 3.8%. The patient received two cycles of PC chemotherapy (pemetrexed with 0.9g d1 and carboplatin with 600mg d1) and dacomitinib (30mg). Chest CT showed obvious shrinkage in the lesions in the right upper lung lobe and the lymph nodes of the mediastinum, contributing to partial response (PR). Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) with right upper lobectomy was performed. After chemotherapy and dacomitinib induction, there were no lymph node metastases, and the pathological stage was ypT1bN0M0. After the surgery, two cycles of PC chemotherapy were administered, followed by targeted therapy with dacomitinib as adjuvant treatment for 2 more years in accordance with the diagnosis and treatment guidelines. A progression-free survival (PFS) of more than 14 months was achieved.
