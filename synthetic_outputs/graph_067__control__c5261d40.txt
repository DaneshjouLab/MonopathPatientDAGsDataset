Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) frequently presents with overt metastatic spread, portending a negative prognosis. Conventional treatments include chemotherapeutic agents and molecularly targeted and/or immunotherapeutic agents. Most responders to systemic chemotherapy in metastatic disease experience progression shortly after treatment discontinuation and it is very unusual for a patient to continue to manifest ongoing regression of malignant lesions unless treatment is continued. Moreover, responses occur early during therapy, typically within two to four months, and rarely continue beyond that time frame.

In this study, we describe a 67-year-old man with stage IV spindle cell cancer (initially diagnosed as NSCLC) who demonstrated ongoing radiographic regression over 20 months after receiving only a single dose of an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) without any additional systemic therapy. Conventional approaches would have continued the ICI and credited any ongoing response to multiple doses. However, this case emphasizes that short exposure to ICI may be sufficient in select circumstances. Given that the five-year survival rate for stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has historically been below 5%, observing such a durable response highlights the potential for more individualized immunotherapy strategies.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) frequently presents with overt metastatic spread, which generally confers a dismal prognosis. In metastatic disease, most responders to chemotherapy relapse soon after therapy ends. Responses are also traditionally expected to appear early in treatment - within the first few months - and seldom continue to deepen if therapy is discontinued.

In the era of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), clinicians commonly maintain treatment for prolonged periods, assuming that ongoing exposure is needed for sustained immune-mediated tumor control. This case challenges that assumption. A 67-year-old man with stage IV spindle cell lung cancer experienced a 20-month progression-free interval after just a single dose of ICI, with no other anticancer treatment. Histopathological analysis ultimately confirmed a metastatic spindle cell component, diverging from a typical primary adenocarcinoma of the lung.

Conventional approaches would have persisted with ICI dosing, thereby crediting long-term remission to continued therapy. In contrast, this single-dose scenario underscores the possibility that short ICI exposure can prompt a robust and durable immune response. These observations may inform future strategies that reduce treatment burden, toxicity, and costs, given that they are validated by broader studies.

A 67-year-old male originally presented in 2016 with stage IIIA NSCLC (adenocarcinoma) treated by right middle lobectomy, followed by adjuvant carboplatin/paclitaxel and postoperative radiotherapy (PORT). In 2022, he developed metastatic disease in the right lung, liver, and brain. An upper and lower GI endoscopy was performed due to microcytosis, which suggested a possible gastrointestinal primary, but no lesions were identified.

After stereotactic radiation to the single brain metastasis, the patient received infusional 5-fluorouracil/oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) empirically. Histopathological analysis of liver lesions identified a spindle cell carcinoma likely pulmonary in origin despite atypical features. Because of a high proliferative Ki-67 index (90%), the patient received nine weekly doses of docetaxel. However, the disease displayed only modest shrinkage (approximately 10-15%).

In August 2022, a single dose of pembrolizumab (200 mg IV) was administered. Radiographic imaging soon demonstrated more pronounced regression in both lung and liver lesions than had been achieved by chemotherapy alone. The response deepened over the subsequent months without any further anticancer therapy. As of his most recent CT scan in November 2024 - over 20 months after the single ICI dose - he continues to exhibit stable disease, with no new metastatic lesions. He has not reported any immune-related adverse events.
