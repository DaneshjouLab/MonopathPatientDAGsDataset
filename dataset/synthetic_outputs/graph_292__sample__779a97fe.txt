In 2018, a 66-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of depression presented with several weeks of intermittent pain in the right upper back. A CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed a 2.9 cm \u00d7 2.6 cm spiculated lesion in the right inferior hilar region of the lung without diffuse parenchymal disease, subcarinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, multiple liver lesions measuring up to 2.5 cm, and a nodular density near the left adrenal gland. Biopsy of a single liver lesion revealed CK7+, TTF1+ lung adenocarcinoma with high PD-L1 expression (>50%). She was diagnosed with stage IV (cT1cN2M1c) NSCLC. Treatment was initiated with pembrolizumab 200 mg IV every 3 weeks. After two cycles of immunotherapy, disease progressed, and she was switched to second-line alectinib 600 mg twice daily based on repeat molecular sequencing that revealed an EML4-ALK rearrangement. On day 26 of alectinib treatment, the patient was hospitalized with hypoxia and respiratory symptoms. She presented to the hospital with acute dyspnea and hypoxia requiring 100% FiO2 by face mask. A CT scan of the chest showed new diffuse, bilateral ground-glass opacities along with moderate, bilateral pleural effusions. Basic infectious work-up, consisting of blood and cultures, was initiated.
