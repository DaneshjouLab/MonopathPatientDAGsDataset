A 57-year-old man with a history of lung adenocarcinoma, treated with cisplatin and vinorelbine chemotherapy in the previous year, presented with severe headache and vomiting. Over the next three months, he developed bilateral blindness. Initial head CT showed no significant findings, including no hydrocephalus. Further investigation with head MRV revealed occlusion of the left transverse sinus. Gd-enhanced MRI showed no abnormal enhancement. Hematological, coagulation, biochemical, and serological findings were normal. Lumbar puncture revealed an intracranial pressure higher than 40 cmH2O. Cerebrospinal fluid cell count, protein, and glucose were 28 cells/\u03bcL, 36.1 mg/dL, and 42 mg/dL, respectively. Cerebrospinal fluid tumor cytology was positive. The headache was relieved by repeated lumbar punctures, but medication was not effective. Intracranial hypertension due to left transverse sinus occlusion associated with lung cancer was diagnosed, and 250 mg of acetazolamide/day was prescribed. While diagnostic catheter angiography was being planned, the patient suddenly lost consciousness.
