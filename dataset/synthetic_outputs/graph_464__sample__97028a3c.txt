A 74-year-old man with a 30 pack-year smoking history was diagnosed with squamous cell lung cancer. The patient underwent right upper lobe resection with lymph-node dissection; the TNM status was T1bN0M0 (stage IA2). Fifteen months later, CT revealed another tumor in the right middle lobe and enlarged lymph nodes in the right hilum. Squamous cell lung cancer was diagnosed again, with endobronchial ultrasound\u2010guided biopsy (cT1bN2M0, stage IIIA). The patient received curative chemoradiotherapy consisting of radiotherapy (60\u2009Gy), carboplatin, and paclitaxel, followed by durvalumab (anti\u2010PD-L1 drug). After the second cycle of durvalumab, CT revealed ground-glass opacities in both lungs; ICI-induced or radiation-induced pneumonitis was suspected. The patient was started on high-dose prednisolone (60\u2009mg [1 mg/kg]/day). After prednisolone was reduced to 10 mg/day.
