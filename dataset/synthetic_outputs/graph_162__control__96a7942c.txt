A 70-year-old patient with recurrent lung squamous carcinoma was started on pembrolizumab treatment (200 mg every three weeks). After 14 months of pembrolizumab treatment, the patient developed pembrolizumab-induced pancreatitis. Positron emission tomographyâ€“computed tomography showed a tumour-shaped, highly integrated lesion at the pancreatic head and significantly elevated tumour markers, including carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (149.3 U/mL), s-pancreas antigen-1 (44.7 U/mL), and duke pancreatic monoclonal antigen type 2 (412 U/mL). Pembrolizumab-induced immune-related pancreatitis was effectively treated with prednisolone 90 mg (1 mg/kg/day). Four months later, normal levels of the three specific tumour markers were detected, with improved pancreatic enzymes and radiographic findings.
