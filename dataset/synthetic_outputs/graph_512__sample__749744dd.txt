A patient was referred to the hospital after a transbronchial biopsy confirmed non-small cell lung cancer. Physical examination and laboratory data were unremarkable. CT imaging revealed a 4.1 cm right upper lobe mass in the apical portion, with suspected invasion of the right subclavian artery. Clinical staging was determined to be T4N0M0, Stage IIIA.

The patient underwent right upper lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node dissection via median sternotomy. Histological diagnosis revealed squamous cell carcinoma (pT3aN0M0, Stage IIB).

Postoperatively, two drainage tubes were placed in the right thoracic cavity, and a total milky fluid volume of 2000 ml was drained on postoperative day (POD) 2. The volume of chylous drainage did not reduce with total parenteral nutrition.

On POD 4, right-sided video-assisted thoracic surgery was performed 1 hour after intake of ice cream, to identify the site of chylous leakage. Intraoperative observation revealed multiple leakage sites between the trachea and superior vena cava, which were clipped and sealed with fibrin glue. The thoracic duct could not be identified in the right posterior mediastinum. The volume of chylous drainage did not decrease after the surgical procedure.

On POD 5 the patient complained of dyspnea. Chest X-ray revealed left pleural effusion, and a drainage tube was inserted into the left pleural cavity.

Lymphangiography (LAG) was performed to identify the leakage site, and the total amount of drained effusion from both sides was 3200 ml/day on POD 6 (2 days after the reoperation).
