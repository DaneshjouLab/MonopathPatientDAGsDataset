A 61-year-old female with a 5-year history of hypertension presented in May 2018 with painful left cervical lymphadenopathy for 2 months. Initial suspicion was tuberculous lymphadenopathy. However, positron emission tomography revealed fluorine-18 deoxyglucose (FDG-PET-CT) accumulation in lymph nodes of the neck, supracondylar, right iliac crest, sternal, mediastinum, and nasopharynx regions, but not in the lung, leading to suspicion of lymphoma. The patient underwent a core needle biopsy guided by ultrasound for the first time in the enlarged lymph node of her right neck. After three rounds of biopsy of her cervical superficial enlarged lymph nodes, she received a final diagnosis of occult metastatic lung cancer. The patient was diagnosed with Occult primary non-small cell lung cancer (OP-NSCLC), a pathological diagnosis of NSCLC based on the nodal biopsies without primary sites in the lungs by PET-CT or CT, and in which no other cancer is identified in 5 years. The patient had a relatively long survival time of 4 years.
