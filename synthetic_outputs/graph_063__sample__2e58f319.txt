A 60-year-old male presented with a one-year history of cough, production of white foamy sputum, and dyspnea with exertion. Six months prior to presentation, the cough increased in frequency and severity with exertion.

An August 2024 chest CT scan revealed a lesion in the posterior segment of the lower lobe of the right lung, considered a central type lung cancer with obstructive pneumonia. An enhanced chest and abdomen CT on August 27, 2024, showed central type lung cancer in the lower lobe of the right lung invading the middle lobe and lower lobe bronchus, segmental atelectasis and obstructive pneumonia in the lower lobe, and pulmonary emphysema changes in both lungs.

On August 28, 2024, bronchoscopy showed significant narrowing of the right lower lobe bronchus with extensive necrotic material. Other lobar bronchi were patent with mild erythema. No new growth, narrowing, or active bleeding was seen.

Histopathology of right main bronchus mucosa revealed squamous cell carcinoma (middle-low differentiation). Immunohistochemistry: CK7 (-), Ki-67 (20%+), Syn (-), TTF-1 (-), P40 (+), P63 (+), CK5/6 (+). Head MR and bone scan showed no significant abnormalities.

The patient was diagnosed with lung malignancy (squamous cell carcinoma cT2N1M0 IIb stage) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The thoracic surgery department advised against surgery.
