A patient presented with recurrent fever, cough, and sputum production. The patient's medical history included hypertension, coronary artery disease, and diabetes. Physical examination revealed moist rales, coarse breath sounds, and pleural friction rubs. Digital clubbing and peripheral edema were also noted. Imaging showed a large consolidation shadow and a mass-like consolidation with central necrosis in the lung, indicating inflammation. Differential diagnoses considered included lung abscess, lung adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, small cell lung cancer, sarcomatoid carcinoma, teratomas, and immature teratomas. Further investigations included measurements of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and estradiol levels, as well as a white blood cell count and procalcitonin levels. A sputum microbiological culture was performed. A lung biopsy was conducted, revealing necrotic tissue. Immunohistochemical staining showed Thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) (−), Napsin A (−), P40 (−), and Syn (−), but AFP (+) and GPC-3 (+).
