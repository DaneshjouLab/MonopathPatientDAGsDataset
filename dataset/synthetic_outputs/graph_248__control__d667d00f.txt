A patient presented with cardiovascular-related symptoms. Further investigation revealed a complex clinical picture including arterial hypertension, cardiomegaly, and arrhythmias. Imaging studies identified a thrombus and vegetation, raising concerns for potential embolic events. The patient was diagnosed with lung cancer, which had metastasized to the lungs and heart, resulting in both lung metastases and cardiac metastases. The presence of cardiac metastasis was further supported by the identification of a tumor within the heart. The patient experienced both arrhythmia and arrhythmias as a consequence of the cardiac involvement. The overall prognosis was guarded due to the advanced stage of the malignant tumor and the presence of cardiac metastasis.
