Case 1: A 60-year-old man presented with a large left-sided adrenal mass, characterized as indeterminate on CT imaging. Biochemical investigations ruled out tumor hypersecretion. 18F FDG PET/CT was performed to exclude metastases and identified a pulmonary nodule in the left upper lobe. The resected adrenal tumor's histology revealed a secondary metastasis from an adenocarcinoma of the lung.

Case 2: An 88-year-old male was found to have a heterogeneous and vascular left-sided suprarenal mass and a smaller right-sided adrenal nodule. Both adrenal nodules had indeterminate radiological characteristics. Biochemical investigations were negative. PET/CT demonstrated high avidity in the bilateral adrenal nodules but no extra-adrenal FDG avid disease. Histology demonstrated a metastatic carcinoma of pulmonary origin.
