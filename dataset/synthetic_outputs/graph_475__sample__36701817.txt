A 54-year-old male with a history of heavy cigarette smoking was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). The patient received multi-line radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Subsequently, the patient was treated with nivolumab (PD-1 inhibitor) and achieved stable disease (SD) for approximately 15 months. Disease progression occurred after nivolumab treatment. Following disease progression, next-generation sequencing (NGS) revealed the homozygous deletion of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B gene and CDKN mutation. A thoracic CT scan on November 18, 2011, showed space-occupying lesions on the left upper pulmonary lobe, indicating metastasis of peripheral lung cancer to the mediastinal lymph node. A subsequent thoracic CT on November 21, 2011, revealed a lesion approximately 2.2 cm × 3.2 cm × 5 cm in size, spreading to the lymph node in the bilateral mediastinum area 4–6 and the left hilar, with the shortest diameter about 2.5 cm. Brush cytology and lymph node biopsy at station 4R on November 29, 2011, detected adenocarcinoma cells.
