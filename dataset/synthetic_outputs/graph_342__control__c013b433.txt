A patient was diagnosed with prostate cancer. Initial treatment involved androgen deprivation therapy, including bilateral orchidectomy and antiandrogen treatment with bicalutamide tablets. The patient later developed castration-resistant disease, characterized by rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and the presence of bone metastatic lesions. This progression led to a diagnosis of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Docetaxel treatment was initiated. The patient presented with multiple bone metastases and leukopenia. The patient had metastatic castration-sensitive PCa. The patient experienced metastatic relapse and castration-resistance. Cytoreductive local treatment, including cytoreductive prostatectomy, was considered in the context of oligometastasis. The patient had adenocarcinoma with nodal involvement and distant metastasis. The patient had lethal PCa. The patient had diverse cancers, including breast cancer and lung cancer, treated with carboplatin and platinum chemotherapy.
