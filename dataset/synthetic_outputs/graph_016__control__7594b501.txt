A 51-year-old female patient, born in 1970, with no serious comorbidities, underwent resection of malignant melanoma in April 2013. Subsequently, a suspicious lymph node in the left axilla was detected on ultrasound, and biopsy confirmed a metastasis of malignant melanoma. During a routine follow-up CT scan of the lung for her history of malignant melanoma, a subsolid lesion was incidentally discovered in the right lung. Histological examination of the resected lung tissue revealed infiltration by primary lung adenocarcinoma, with predominantly acinar (85%) and less lepidic (15%) growth. Lung lesions, often discovered incidentally on chest CT, pose a diagnostic challenge due to their diverse etiology, including both benign and malignant nature. Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide.
