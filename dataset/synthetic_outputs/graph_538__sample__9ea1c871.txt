A 32-year-old primigravid healthcare worker at 16 weeks’ gestation presented with a single episode of large volume haemoptysis associated with shortness of breath and wheeze. She reported no chest pain or fevers, and no prior history of venous thromboembolism. She was a never-cigarette smoker and had a prior diagnosis of asthma, manifesting as intermittent wheeze and dyspnoea. On examination, she had decreased air entry at the left upper zone. Admission blood tests showed normal complete blood count, electrolytes, liver function, and inflammatory markers.

Her vital signs revealed sinus tachycardia of 120 beats/min, saturating at 98% on room air and was afebrile. Chest X-ray showed left upper lobe consolidation. CT pulmonary angiogram demonstrated a 35x25mm tumour mass arising from the distal left main bronchus, invading into the mediastinum and causing complete collapse of the left upper lobe. Attenuated vasculature of the hyperexpanded left lower lobe, multiple left-sided subpleural blebs and a left small loculated medial pneumothorax were also observed.

Further findings included thickening and irregularity of the left visceral pleura, normal right lung, and no pulmonary embolism. Bronchoscopy revealed a large globular mass at the distal left main bronchus, completely occluding the lumen. Biopsy of the lesion showed typical pulmonary carcinoid with a proliferation index (Ki-67)<2%.

An endobronchial view showed a large obstructive globular mass arising from the distal left main bronchus. Therapeutic debulking bronchoscopy with re-expansion of the left lower lobe was performed during the pregnancy. Repeat inspection bronchoscopy at 22 weeks’ gestation showed stable intraluminal disease.

A Gallium-68 DOTATATE PET scan was delayed until postdelivery.

The patient had an uncomplicated induced vaginal delivery at 38 weeks’ gestation and gave birth to a healthy baby boy.

Postdelivery, a Gallium-68 DOTATATE PET scan showed an intensely avid left upper lobe mass with no nodal or metastatic disease.

The patient underwent a left upper lobe sleeve lobectomy.

Histology confirmed typical carcinoid tumor (TC), with a mitotic rate of less than 2/2 mm2 and no evidence of necrosis. Macroscopic findings from the upper lobe showed multiple pleural blebs, corresponding to the CT findings. Resected tumour with trabecular and organoid growth pattern and uniform tissue cytomorphology. Serial sections of the left upper lobe from superior to inferior. No lymph node involvement on sampling. Cut sections 13–16 show a rounded, firm, tan tumour measuring 20x20x20 mm.

Pulmonary function tests (postdelivery) showed spirometry, lung volumes and diffusion capacity within normal limits with no acute bronchodilator response.

The patient was discharged 3 days postoperatively with good recovery. Follow up by the respiratory team with serial chest imaging was arranged. Baby and mother were doing well at 4 months.
