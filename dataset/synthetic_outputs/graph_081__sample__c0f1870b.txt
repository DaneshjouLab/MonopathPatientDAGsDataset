A 46-year-old woman was incidentally found to have a 1.3-cm pulmonary nodule in the left anterior basal segment during a routine health examination. She reported no symptoms and had no significant medical history, including no history of tuberculosis or lung infections. A chest radiograph showed a solitary pulmonary nodule in the left lower lung field.

Chest CT demonstrated a peripheral pulmonary nodule in the left lower lobe. The patient underwent endobronchial ultrasound transbronchial lung biopsy using a guide sheath, followed by transbronchial lung cryobiopsy employing a cryoprobe with a 1-mm diameter, performed four times through the same guide sheath. The procedure was successfully completed with only minor bleeding. Biopsy revealed granulomatous inflammation in both the forceps and cryobiopsy specimens.

After cryobiopsy, a chest radiograph showed increased density in the lower zone of the left lung. Tissue sample PCR was negative for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and NTM. One week post-biopsy, a follow-up outpatient chest radiograph revealed an enlarged shadow at the location of the original lesion. The patient reported discharge of a purulent and intermittent blood-tinged sputum and was administered a daily dose of 400 mg of moxifloxacin.

Two weeks after starting antibiotics, a chest radiograph indicated a slight increase in the size of the lesion, but there was an improvement in her symptoms, with no other abnormal findings such as fever. Antibiotic therapy was continued with regular outpatient follow-ups.

Three weeks after tissue biopsy, the lesion demonstrated improvement on chest radiograph. Growth of acid-fast bacilli was reported in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid obtained during examination.
