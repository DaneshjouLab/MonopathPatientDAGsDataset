In October 2020, a 54-year-old female presented for a routine physical examination, denying any respiratory-related symptoms or systemic discomfort. A CT scan revealed a 1.4 cm pure ground-glass nodule in the dorsal segment of the right lower lobe, raising suspicion for a tumour. Another 0.6 cm nodule in the basal segment of the right lower lobe suggested possible intrapulmonary metastasis.

The patient was followed up for 3 years, during which time a chest CT revealed no recurrence of lung cancer. However, during this period, the 0.6 x 0.4 cm nodule in the basal segment of the right lower lobe was resected and pathologically diagnosed as Cryptococcus.

Following the resection of the Cryptococcus nodule, chest CT scans showed no recurrence over 3 years of follow-up.

Further evaluation revealed the patient had normal immune function, no travel history, no history of contact with pigeon manure or soil, no history of smoking or alcohol consumption in the past month, and no steroid or antibiotic treatment before admission. The patient denied a history of malignant tumours, diabetes, autoimmune diseases, hepatitis, or tuberculosis. At the time of admission, her vital signs were normal. Physical examination revealed no skin lesions, enlarged lymph nodes, or splenomegaly.

A physical examination revealed clear breath sounds in both lungs, with no rales. The patient had no history of surgery or trauma. Laboratory results were as follows: WBC 4.77 G/L (Neutrophils 62.3%, Lymphocytes 30%, Eosinophils 0.8%, Basophils 0.6%), RBC 4.01 T/L, Hemoglobin 115 g/L, Platelets 248 G/L, ALT 9.3 U/L, AST 15.4 U/L, GGT 27.3 U/L, Total Bilirubin 12.7 umol/L, Nonconjugated Bilirubin 10.6 umol/L, Conjugated Bilirubin 2.1 umol/L, Total Bile Acids 2.2 umol/L, Albumin 45.6 g/L, hs-CRP 0.36 mg/L, ESR 4 mm/h. Tuberculosis antibody was negative.

Sputum Gram stain and bacterial culture were negative for microorganisms. Sputum acid-fast staining and sputum culture were negative for acid-fast bacilli. Bronchoscopy showed no abnormalities. Cytology, bacteriology, and pathology of the lavage fluid were negative.

An 18F-FDG-PET-CT showed elevated glucose metabolism in the dorsal segment of the right lower lobe, suggesting lung cancer. Metabolism level of the nodule in the basal segment of the right lower lobe and the anterior segment of the right upper lobe was not abnormally increased, but the possibility of a malignant tumour could not be excluded.

Due to the suspicion of lung cancer, a percutaneous lung puncture biopsy of the ground glass nodule in the dorsal segment of the right lower lobe was planned to clarify the nature of the right lower lobe nodule.

The patient subsequently underwent lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node dissection via VATS to remove the
