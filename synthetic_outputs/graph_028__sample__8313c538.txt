An 84-year-old woman with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, arthritis, and hypertension presented to the clinic with an incidental finding of an enlarging solitary lung nodule. She denied shortness of breath, cough, chest pain, hemoptysis, palpitation, fever, and recent illness. The lung nodule measured 0.9 \u00d7 0.8 cm 4 years prior. Recent chest CT scan showed a 1.3 \u00d7 1.2 cm well circumscribed lesion. PET/CT scan revealed a 1.4 cm nodule with an avidity of 3.8 without any metastatic or nodal involvement. Further workup with Head CT without contrast to rule out metastasis revealed mild white matter hypoattenuation, but no evidence of acute hemorrhage, mass effect, or extra-axial collection. Imaged portions of the skull, mastoid air cells, nasopharynx, and parotid gland were unremarkable. Impression: probable mild chronic small-vessel white matter ischemia, but no evidence of any meningioma or suspicious nodule was found in the brain. Differential diagnoses included carcinoid tumor, non-small-cell lung cancer, or a hamartoma. The patient underwent a robotic-assisted left VATS wedge resection of the left upper lobe under general anesthesia to remove the nodule. No distant metastasis was observed. The nodule was greater than 0.8cm in size and increased in size over the preceding four years.
