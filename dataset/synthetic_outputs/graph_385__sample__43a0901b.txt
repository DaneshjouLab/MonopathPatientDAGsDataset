A 76-year-old Caucasian male with a history of previously excised malignant rectal tumor (pathologic staging: T1aN0M0), hypertension, diabetes, diverticulitis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with a former 45-pack-year cigarette smoking history presented with a dry persistent cough. CT of the chest confirmed a hypermetabolic 1.2-cm spiculated nodule in the right upper lobe (RUL) of the lung without significant hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Robotically-assisted right upper lobectomy with hilar and mediastinal lymph node dissection's final pathology revealed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the lung with negative margins. Ten lymph nodes examined were negative for disease involvement, and it was specified as a pT1AN0 case.

The patient was placed on surveillance and followed up with routine imaging. Approximately five years following diagnosis, he complained of right-sided posterior rib pain. MRI revealed abnormal signal intensity involving the right posterior ribs with cortical destruction of the fifth rib. PET/CT scan showed 4.4 cm involvement with a lytic lucency involving the right posterior fifth rib, hypermetabolic activity and pleural thickening at the right lung base, and a 0.7-cm avid pulmonary nodule at the left lung base. Core needle biopsy of right posterior fifth rib lesion showed malignant cells consistent with recurrent bronchogenic adenocarcinoma. PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx was positive with a low expression of 1%, and molecular testing revealed KRAS G12C mutation.

The patient was initiated on single-agent pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously and had a good response. Approximately 18 months after pembrolizumab initiation, lab results revealed high absolute eosinophils levels of 1445 cells/uL (normal range: 15-500 cells/uL) and white blood cells (WBC) count of 850 x 10/uL. The patient was administered one more dose of pembrolizumab, but absolute eosinophils levels remained consistently high at 1304 cells/uL and WBC count at 820 x 10/uL. PET/CT scan confirmed post-radiation pneumonitis, associated with recent stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to a lesion in the left lower lung field, and pancolitis. Colonoscopy revealed normal appendiceal orifice, ileocecal valve cecum, and rectum upon visual examination.
