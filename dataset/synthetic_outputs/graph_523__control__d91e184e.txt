A patient presented with squamous cell carcinoma and an EGFR mutation. PD‐L1 expression was evaluated, and Pembrolizumab therapy was initiated. The patient's case involved squamous cell lung cancers with an EGFR mutation and PD‐L1 expression analysis. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations were a key consideration. The patient's diagnosis was squamous cell lung cancer (SCLC) with EGFR mutations. Pembrolizumab therapy was administered, and PD‐L1 expression was monitored. In contrast to nonsquamous cell lung cancer, the patient's case focused on EGFR mutations and PD‐L1 expression. The patient experienced a dry cough, and a tumor was identified as squamous cell carcinoma. EGFR status was assessed.
