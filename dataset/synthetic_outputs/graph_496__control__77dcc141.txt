A 59-year-old woman with no smoking history presented in February 2021 with an incidentally noted 2.7 x 3.0 cm mass in the left lower lobe (LLL) of her lung on computed tomography (CT). A positron emission tomography (PET) scan revealed avidity in the LLL mass (SUV 6.8 units) and regional lymph nodes (SUV 3.1â€“4.9 units). A brain magnetic resonance imaging scan was negative for metastatic disease. Biopsies revealed poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with metastasis to the pleura, stage cT3N2M1a/IVa. Eventually, positive NUT immunohistochemistry, NUT fluorescence in situ hybridization, and RNA next-generation sequencing with a *BRD2::NUTM1* fusion led to the diagnosis of *BRD2::NUTM1*-driven NUT carcinoma. She received multiple lines of chemotherapy with response and is still alive at 2 years postdiagnosis.
