A 74-year-old man presented with anti-amphiphysin antibody autoimmunity and multiple symptoms, including bulbar palsy and cerebellar ataxia. The patient's symptoms included dysphagia. He was treated with intravenous cyclophosphamide. After two courses of cyclophosphamide therapy, he was able to tolerate oral intakes such as easily mashed foods and soft foods. The patient also experienced dysarthria and ataxia. The case suggests that intravenous cyclophosphamide can be effective in treating patients with anti-amphiphysin autoimmunity presenting with bulbar palsy and cerebellar ataxia.
