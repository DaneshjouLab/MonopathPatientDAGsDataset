In June 2020, a 44-year-old non-smoking female was admitted to the hospital for a persistent cough. Imaging via PET-CT revealed a mass in the right middle lobe and an enlarged lymph node in the mediastinum, which surrounded the right main bronchus. Following imaging, the patient underwent an ultrasonography-guided percutaneous right cervical lymph node biopsy. Pathologic examination revealed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, cT1bN3M1a, stage IVA. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay identified IGR(upstreamC2orf16)-ALKexon20 fusion (abundance: 9.7%), TP53 mutation (abundance: 42.6%), and ERBB4 mutation (abundance: 18.7%) in the tumor tissue. Following diagnosis, the patient received continuous oral alectinib, 600 mg twice daily. 4.5 months later, progression of the disease was observed due to the mediastinal lesion invading the bilateral main bronchus, leading to tracheal stenosis. To alleviate the tracheal stenosis, bronchus stents were placed. Following stent placement, immunohistochemistry (IHC) revealed positive expression of ALK-D5F3 and BRAF-V600E.
