A 62-year-old female with a history of vitiligo for 10 years and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) presented with cough and chest tightness. In November 2017, a chest CT revealed space-occupying lesions and a large pleural effusion in the right lung. She was diagnosed with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma with negative EGFR/ALK/ROS1 mutations. The patient was subsequently treated with anti-programmed cell death-1 (anti-PD-1) therapy.

In December 2017, the patient received 6 cycles of SHR-1210 combined with pemetrexed and carboplatin, followed by 29 cycles of SHR-1210 in combination with pemetrexed. By February 2018, after two cycles of treatment (6 weeks), lung cancer was effectively controlled, with efficacy evaluation showing stable disease. However, the patient suffered from grade 1 hypothyroidism (CTCAE 4.0). On February 28, 2018, 75\u03bcg levothyroxine was administered once a day to control the immune-related hypothyroidism.

Within 6 months of anti-PD-1 antibody treatment, the patient's skin depigmentation aggravated. After treatment with SHR-1210 combined with pemetrexed and carboplatin, tumor density gradually decreased, but vitiligo rapidly aggravated with depigmentation of the skin over the whole body in just half a year. The facial depigmentation area began to expand around the mouth and eyes, and the depigmentation lesions gradually appeared in other parts of the body, such as the inguinal region, cheeks, limbs, etc. Hair was also affected.
