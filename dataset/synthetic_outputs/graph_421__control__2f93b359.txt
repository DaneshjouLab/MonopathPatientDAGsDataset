A patient presented to a family doctor with a persistent cough and fever. Chest radiography revealed left pleural effusion. Laboratory examination revealed a high titer for hyaluronic acid in the effusion. Pleural effusion cytology revealed large epithelioid cells with mild nuclear atypia, which were considered reactive mesothelial cells. These cells harbored variously sized intracytoplasmic vacuoles that were Alcian-blue-positive, suggesting hyaluronan production. Computed tomography revealed diffuse multinodular or cystic lesions in the left parietal pleura. Biopsy revealed large epithelioid cells that loosely proliferated against a prominent myxoid background. FISH showed homozygous deletion of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (p16) on chromosome 9p21. Electron-microscopy demonstrated a dense microvillus pattern on the surface of the tumor cells, indicating a mesothelial cell origin, and variously sized vacuoles in the cytoplasm, confirming the presence of intracytoplasmic vacuoles demonstrated on cytology. BAP1-immunohistochemistry revealed nuclear negativity in tumor cells. Based on these findings, the lesion was diagnosed as an epithelioid mesothelioma with a prominent myxoid stroma. The histological diagnosis was malignant mesothelioma of the myxoid variant according to the WHO classification system (2015, 4th edition). The tumor tissues obtained during surgery harbored prominent myxoid stroma, which proved that the present tumor was consistent with this type of mesothelioma. The patient and family wished for total resection of the tumor and postoperative chemotherapy. However, after no effect on progressive disease was observed, chemotherapy was discontinued, and the patient died eight months after surgery.
