On April 23, 2024, a patient presented with weakness and numbness in the upper limbs, progressively worsening symptoms, an inability to stand or walk, and difficulty in making a fist with both hands. Physical examination revealed bilateral upper limb muscle strength of three out of five and lower limb muscle strength of two out of five. Sensory examinations were normal, including pain, temperature, vibration, and position sense.

Neurological evaluation revealed no Babinski sign or exaggerated deep tendon reflexes. Cranial and cervical MRI were negative for space-occupying lesions. Nerve conduction study showed lower amplitude in the right median nerve, bilateral tibia, and bilateral common peroneal nerve CMAP and reduced conduction velocity in the right common peroneal nerve; SNAPs were normal. F wave showed a decrease in the outgoing wave rate of the bilateral median nerve and bilateral tibial nerves.

Further investigation included a lumbar puncture, which revealed normal pressure, elevated CSF protein (0.97 g/L; normal 0.01-0.45 g/L), and a normal nucleated cell count (1.0 * 10^6/L; normal 0-8.0*10^6/L). CSF cytology, culture, and smear were negative. CSF shed cells showed no tumor cells. Serum autoimmune and ANCA antibodies were negative.

Detailed CSF analysis showed IgG oligoclonal bands in CSF were similar to serum (type IV CSF and serum). IgG 24-h intrathecal synthesis rate was 10.04 mg/24 h (reference range < 7mg/24 h). Ganglioside antibody detection was IgM positive for anti-GM1, anti-GM2, and anti-GD2 antibodies. Paraneoplastic syndrome antibodies in CSF and serum were anti-Hu antibodies positive; anti-Ri, anti-CV2, anti-amphiphysin, anti-Ma1, anti-Ma2, anti-SOX1, anti-DNER, anti-Zic4, anti-titin, anti-recovery, anti-PKC, anti-GAD65, and anti-Yo antibodies were negative.

Based on these findings, a diagnosis of anti-Hu positivity associated with adebrelimab-induced paraneoplastic neuropathy was made. Treatment was initiated with discontinuation of adebrelimab, methylprednisolone sodium succinate at 1000 mg/day, and immunoglobulin (0.4 g/kg/d) 20 g/day was administered for 5 days. Post-treatment, bilateral upper limb muscle strength improved to four out of five, lower limb muscle strength improved to three out of five, and symptoms improved; however, the patient was still unable to stand and walk.

The patient developed progressive bilateral symmetrical limb weakness, separation of the CSF protein cells, and peripheral nerve axonal degeneration with demyelinating changes, primarily axonal damage. Anti-GM1, anti-GM2, and anti-GD2 IgM antibodies were positive, anti-Hu antibodies were positive after two cycles of ICI treatment, and the final diagnosis was PNS. Autoimmune encephalitis antibodies (anti-NMDA, anti-LGI1, anti-CASPR2, anti-AMPAR1, and anti-AMPAR2) were not detected because of insufficient CSF samples.
