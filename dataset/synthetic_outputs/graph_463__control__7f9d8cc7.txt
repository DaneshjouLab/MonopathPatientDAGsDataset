A woman in her 60s, previously in good health, presented with new onset perianal swellings associated with anal itching for approximately 3 months. She also reported worsening constipation and a slight increase in fatigue. Ten months prior to this evaluation, she underwent peritonectomy, omentectomy, hysteroadnexectomy, and subtotal colectomy, followed by hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy with cisplatin and doxorubicin, for malignant peritoneal mesothelioma, epithelioid type. Subsequently, she received adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin and pemetrexed for 6 months after surgery.

Physical examination revealed two button-like, subcentimeter, solid lesions in the perineal region, located in the right anterolateral and anterior perianal quadrants, the latter being close to the vagina, without local inflammation. These lesions initially appeared like perianal abscesses, but the patient denied fever or abnormal secretion. Laboratory tests did not show leucocytosis or systemic inflammation. Tumor markers were assessed but were within normal limits. Whole-body CT and pelvic magnetic resonance imaging revealed an extraperitoneal thickening of the mesorectum surrounding the middle-lower rectum. Positron emission tomography showed non-homogeneous increased uptake of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose in the mesorectum, with greater metabolic activity detected in the perineum and along the rectovaginal septum. No other pathological uptake was identified. The patient was diagnosed with malignant mesothelioma recurrence spreading from the peritoneal cavity to the perineum through the rectovaginal space.
