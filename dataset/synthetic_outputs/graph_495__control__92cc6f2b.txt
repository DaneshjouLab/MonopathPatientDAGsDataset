A patient undergoing robotic lobectomy experienced an unusual complication: intrathoracic gastric volvulus leading to gastric ischemia. The patient developed this complication post-operatively, specifically on Post-Operative Day #1 (POD#1). Initial management included prompt placement of a nasogastric (NG) tube to decompress the stomach, which initially drained 1200 mL of food and clear gastric fluid. The patient also responded well to IV fluid resuscitation. However, the NG tube output became bloody rather than bilious over the subsequent 4 hours, raising concern. An exploratory laparotomy was performed on the afternoon of POD#1, confirming the presence of a large type-III hiatal hernia with most of the stomach herniated into the left pleural cavity and demonstrating organo-axial torsion. The stomach was gently reduced, the torsion corrected, and the esophagus mobilized to allow the gastro-esophageal junction to return into the abdomen without tension. The hiatus was closed primarily by reapproximating the right and left crura with interrupted, pledgeted silk sutures. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed severe ischemia in two areas of the stomach, but no evidence of transmural. The patient required emergency surgery due to the gastric ischemia.
