A patient with a history of exposure to asbestos was diagnosed with malignant pleural mesothelioma, specifically epithelioid malignant pleural mesothelioma. Initial treatment involved extrapleural pneumonectomy followed by chemoradiotherapy, achieving a macroscopic complete resection (MCR). Subsequently, the patient underwent pleurectomy/decortication (P/D) with the goal of macroscopic complete resection (MCR). Despite these interventions, the patient experienced recurrent disease and was treated with immunotherapy. This led to the development of pneumonitis, which was managed with oral prednisolone therapy. The patient later developed a fistulous pyothorax and an empyema cavity, necessitating transbronchial occlusion and ultimately an open window thoracotomy. Transbronchial spigot insertion was also performed. The patient underwent multiple pleurectomy/decortication procedures.
