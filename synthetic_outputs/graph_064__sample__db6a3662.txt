A 44-year-old asymptomatic nulliparous woman presented with a palpable pelvic mass. Physical examination revealed an enlarged uterus of about 10- to 12-week size, which was mobile, firm in consistency, with no uterine or forniceal tenderness, and mild swelling in the right pubic area. Gynecological sonography on January 30, 2020, identified an anterior wall uterine leiomyoma, measuring 112\u00d794\u00d7108 mm, accompanied by ascites measuring 65\u00d742 mm and a 20\u00d714 mm mass. Laparotomic myomectomy was performed on February 17, 2020, with incidental discovery of a pelvic tumor. The pelvic tumor was described as a cauliflower-like lesion disseminated across the right pelvic wall, cul-de-sac, anterior uterine surface, bladder, and colon. Biopsy of the sigmoid colon serosa (0.8 cm sample) showed proliferative mesothelial cells without significant atypia or necrosis. A post-myomectomy CT scan, performed on February 26th, 2020, revealed seeding in the lower pelvis, characterized by multiple small, heterogeneous, enhancing nodules on the peritoneum and a prominent soft-tissue mass in the right adnexa. CT scan revealed moderate ascites and nonspecific peritoneal thickening, with small enhancing nodules on the peritoneal membrane and soft-tissue thickening in the right adnexa. Histopathology identified bland mesothelial cells without invasion, and immunohistochemistry showed no significant staining loss. Differential diagnosis included well-differentiated papillary mesothelioma, epithelioid peritoneal mesothelioma, and florid mesothelial hyperplasia; well-differentiated papillary mesothelioma was highly suspected.
