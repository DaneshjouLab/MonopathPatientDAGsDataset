A 70-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and cerebral infarction was diagnosed with right-sided non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), stage cT3NXMX, consistent with squamous cell carcinoma via immunohistochemistry, in December 2021.  A chest CT revealed a 5.5 x 4.9 cm soft tissue density mass in the apical segment of the right upper lung lobe. Immunohistochemistry showed CD56 negative, CK5/6 positive, CK7 negative, Ki-67 positive (about 30%), NapsinA negative, P40 positive, P63 positive, and TTF-1 negative. PET-CT showed a soft tissue mass in the upper lobe of the right lung with increased metabolism, as well as several regional lesions. Preoperative chemotherapy and immunotherapy were recommended, with surgery to be determined based on post-treatment evaluation.

The patient completed his first cycle of albumin paclitaxel, cisplatin, and tislelizumab treatment in December 2021. On December 7, the patient received central vein catheterization. On December 8, the patient was given one cycle of albumin-bound paclitaxel with cisplatin and tislelizumab. The patient was also taking Centrum.

One month later, the patient experienced left-sided limb weakness and numbness and was admitted to Hubei Cancer Hospital. Vital signs were: Temperature 36.5Â°C, pulse rate 85 beats/min, respiratory rate 19 breaths/min, blood pressure 135/85 mmHg. Blood tests revealed platelet count of 212 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin level of 105 g/L, white blood cell count of 3.3 x 10^9/L, and red blood cell count of 3.64 x 10^12/L.

The patient reported poor tolerance to the initial treatment, mainly with hand and foot numbness and pain and bone marrow suppression. He complained of inability to stand and walk, and was admitted with crutches. The patient reported hollow and numb pain like a dry turtle shell on the sole of his feet. He was given pregabalin (75 mg) to alleviate numbness and pain in the hands and feet, however, symptom relief was not significant. The patient refused further treatment with albumin-paclitaxel. Liposomal paclitaxel (240 mg), cisplatin (90 mg), and tislelizumab (200 mg) were administered.

Following two cycles of liposomal paclitaxel (240 mg), cisplatin (90 mg), and tislelizumab (200 mg), ambulation improved significantly, and pain and numbness reduced. After four cycles of treatment, a partial response was observed, with tumor size reduced to 2.9x2.7 cm^2. The patient was given a lower limit dose of 135 mg/m^2 paclitaxel liposome, resulting in a good treatment effect and patient tolerability. The neuropathy disappeared after switching to liposomal paclitaxel.
