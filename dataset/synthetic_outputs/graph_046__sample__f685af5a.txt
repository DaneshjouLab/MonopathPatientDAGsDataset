In August 2023, a 62-year-old female presented with intermittent dry cough and left temporal headaches. In early September, the patient presented with subacute vertigo, nausea, and vomiting. Over the following week, ataxia rapidly evolved. The patient experienced blurred vision and gradually developed nystagmus, diplopia, and ataxia of the head and perioral region, leading to admission to a local hospital. Physical examination indicated coarse horizontal nystagmus in both eyes, while strength and sensation remained intact. A benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) test was negative. Vestibular function tests showed abnormalities in the optomotor center. A cranial MRI (without contrast) showed no obvious abnormalities, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) routine and biochemistry studies returned unremarkable results. Paraneoplastic antibody profiles and anti-neuronal surface antigen antibody spectrum in blood and CSF were both negative. Symptomatic therapy proved ineffective.

On September 30th, the patient was admitted to the hospital. Physical examination revealed a positive Romberg sign and gait ataxia. A CT scan of the chest revealed a solid mass shadow in the upper lobe of the right lung, along with multiple enlarged lymph nodes in both the hilum and mediastinum, raising suspicion for paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration (PCD). Abnormal serum tumor markers were noted: squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCCAg) at 8.2 ng/ml (reference range: <=2.7 ng/ml), neuron-specific enolase (NSE) at 18.1 ng/ml (reference range: <=16.3 ng/ml), and cytokeratin fragment 21-1 (Cyfra21-1) at 16.5 ng/ml (reference range: <=3.5 ng/ml). The anti-Yo antibody was slightly positive in the blood, but other antineuronal antibodies were negative (EUROLINE Paraneoplastic Neurologic Syndrome 12 Antigen test kit).

A contrast-enhanced MRI of the head showed no obvious abnormality. A PET-CT scan revealed a malignant lesion in the upper lobe of the right lung, approximately 4.8x3.7 cm in size, with a maximum standardized uptake value (SUV max) of 64.3, slightly pulling the adjacent pleura and locally close to the oblique and horizontal fissures. Multiple lymph node metastases were identified in the left supraclavicular region, right hilar lung, and mediastinum. Histological and immunohistochemical results from tumor punctures suggested squamous cell lung carcinoma with ALK-D5F3(-), CK7(-), P40(+), TTF-1(-), and PD-L1(22C3)TPS=10%.

On October 18th, a PET-CT scan showed a solid mass in the upper lobe of the right lung with abnormal metabolism. The apical and posterior segments of the right upper lobe were truncated by the tumor.

Oral prednisone was initiated at 30 mg daily (approximately 0.6 mg/kg/day). On October 22nd, a diagnosis of squamous cell lung carcinoma-related PCD was made. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) at 0.4 g/kg/day was initiated for 5 days, resulting in alleviation of vertigo, nausea, and vomiting, and the patient resumed oral feeding.
