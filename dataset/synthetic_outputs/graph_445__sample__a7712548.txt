A 53-year-old male was admitted to the department on October 13, 2023, due to “intermittent chills and fever for over a month, with the discovery of a mediastinal mass 10 days earlier.” The patient had no history of diabetes, tumors, or immune diseases.

In early September 2023, the patient developed intermittent chills, shivering, and fever (highest temperature of 39°C), accompanied by shoulder and back pain, dizziness, and headaches after a cold. The headaches were continuous, without projectile vomiting, dyspnea, or chest tightness.

On October 3, 2023, a chest-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed multiple enhanced nodulars in the bilateral hilum and mediastinum, with the largest one measuring approximately 5.6 cm × 6.1 cm.

On October 10, 2023, the patient experienced no relief after antibiotic treatment at a local hospital. A head-enhanced CT revealed scattered multiple ring-enhanced nodules measuring approximately 1.0 cm × 0.9 cm in both cerebral hemispheres and the left cerebrum, accompanied by extensive surrounding edema. Findings suggested intracranial infectious lesions, potentially indicating tuberculosis.

Further investigation due to intracranial and mediastinal masses led to hospitalization. The patient presented with impaired consciousness and delayed reactions. Laboratory findings included: Leucocyte count 6.4 × 109/L, Neutrophil percentage 78.2%, Procalcitonin level 0.1 ng/mL, Alanine transaminase level 136.1 IU/L, Aspartate aminotransferase level 143.2 IU/L, Carbohydrate antigen 125 level 253.7U/ml. Tests for novel coronavirus, tuberculosis DNA in sputum, Cryptococcal capsule antigen, and India ink staining all came back negative. Preliminary diagnosis was intracranial and mediastinal masses that required further investigation.
