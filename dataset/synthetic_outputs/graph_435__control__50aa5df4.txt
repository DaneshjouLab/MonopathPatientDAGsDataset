A 75-year-old male patient was admitted to the hospital on April 24, complaining of 5 months of recurrent coughing, expectoration, and panting, with worsening symptoms over the past month. The patient's condition deteriorated, and after a positive rescue attempt, the patient died. A pathological examination indicated adenocarcinoma. The case was diagnosed as pneumonia lung adenocarcinoma by frozen lung biopsy after death. The initial symptoms and presentation mimicked pneumonia and tuberculosis, highlighting the difficulty in early diagnosis of pneumonic-type adenocarcinoma (P-ADC). The case underscores the importance of early recognition of this type of lung cancer, as delays in diagnosis and treatment can lead to rapid deterioration and death, especially when patients do not respond to anti-microorganism treatment.
