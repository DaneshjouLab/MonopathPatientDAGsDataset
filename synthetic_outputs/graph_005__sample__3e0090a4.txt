A 54-year-old Chinese male with a 30-year smoking history presented with a worsening cough for 3 months and a performance status score of 1. In April 2023, enhanced CT revealed a 22 mm × 12 mm × 16 mm mass in the right upper lobe with invasion in the right hilum and mediastinum. A PET-CT scan confirmed the CT findings. Biopsy of the lung lesion in the upper right lobe showed positive immunohistochemistry (IHC) for TTF-1, NpA, CK7, CD5/6 and Ki67 (60%); and negative for p40, p63 and CD56. The patient was diagnosed with stage IIIA lung adenocarcinoma (cT1cN2M0). Targeted NGS analysis identified an EGFRG719X mutation with a mutant allele frequency (MAF) of 3.8%. In May 2023, the patient received two cycles of PC chemotherapy (pemetrexed 0.9g d1 and carboplatin 600mg d1) and dacomitinib (30mg). The initial tumor was considered unresectable due to metastasis in the right hilum and mediastinum. After treatment, a chest CT showed obvious shrinkage in the lesions in the right upper lung lobe and the lymph nodes of the mediastinum, contributing to a partial response (PR).
