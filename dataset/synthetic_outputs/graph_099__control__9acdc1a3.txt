Inflammatory Myofibroblastic Tumor After Receiving Treatment for Non-small Cell Carcinoma

The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a former smoker (35 pack-years history, quit smoking one year prior to the original presentation), coronary artery disease, non-obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and obstructive sleep apnea.

The patient underwent a screening low-dose chest CT that showed a new 1-cm spiculated lesion in the inferior aspect of the right upper lobe (RUL). She underwent a PET-CT that showed a markedly hypermetabolic (SUV = 13.1) spiculated RUL pulmonary nodule, consistent with malignancy. It also revealed an adjacent tiny satellite nodule, consistent with an additional site of malignancy.

The patient underwent a needle biopsy of the RUL nodule, and immunostains were positive for Napsin-A and thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1), while staining was negative for CK5/6 and P40. These findings were consistent with a diagnosis of non-small cell carcinoma, favoring poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, clinical stage T2aN0M0.

The patient underwent a PET-CT that showed a moderately hypermetabolic LUL mass (SUV = 16.2) consistent with bronchogenic carcinoma, with no mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. The PET-CT also identified a mildly hypermetabolic (SUV = 3.9) left lower lobe (LLL) nodule, concerning for an additional focus of malignancy.

The patient underwent bronchoscopy and cervical mediastinoscopy. Lymph nodes were sampled from the left and right low paratracheal (L4 and R4) as well as the subcarinal region (station 7), and they were all negative for malignancy. Given the concern for malignancy in the LUL mass, the patient underwent a left upper lobectomy.

The patient was seen in follow-up and tolerated the surgery well, with no postoperative complications. Given the biopsy findings, she will continue with regular follow-ups for her known RUL non-small cell carcinoma.
