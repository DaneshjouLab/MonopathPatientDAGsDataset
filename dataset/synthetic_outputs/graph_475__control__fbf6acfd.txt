A patient presented with lung cancer, specifically lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). The cancer was poorly differentiated and had metastasized. The patient developed both pleural and pericardial effusions. Following treatment, the patient initially experienced stable disease (SD). However, the disease later progressed (PD). Subsequent treatment again resulted in stable disease (SD). Despite treatment, the patient's lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) ultimately metastasized.
