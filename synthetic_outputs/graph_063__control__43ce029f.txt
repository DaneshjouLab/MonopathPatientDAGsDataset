We report a case of a patient with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who gradually developed erythematous rashes on sun-exposed skin with pruritus after one course of anti-PD-1 antibody Camrelizumab combined with chemotherapy. The rashes were initially considered as eczema, but did not improve after symptomatic treatment. The rashes continued to worsen after the third course of treatment, and the pruritus was unbearable. After antibody testing, the patient was found to have positive anti-SS-A/Ro antibody, and the histological changes were consistent with subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus. SCLE was controlled with local and systemic glucocorticoids, hydroxychloroquine, and discontinuation of anti-PD-1 therapy.
