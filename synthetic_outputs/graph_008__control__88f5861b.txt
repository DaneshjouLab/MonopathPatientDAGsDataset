A woman presented with suspected pulmonary and lymph node tuberculosis based on pathological demonstration of granulomatous inflammation. However, after lung biopsy and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) tests, a final diagnosis of pulmonary lymphoepithelial carcinoma (PLELC) was made. PLELC is a distinct subtype of primary lung cancer closely associated with EBV infection. Histopathological features of PLELC can sometimes mimic granulomatous inflammation, leading to initial misdiagnosis. Further studies are needed to investigate the clinical and pathological manifestations in patients with PLELC, given the complex and rarely seen nature of the disease.
