Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Lung Presenting Unilateral Thoracic Hyperhidrosis: A Case Report and Review of Literature

A 74-year-old Japanese man developed interstitial pneumonia and was followed up at our hospital. Chest computed tomography (CT) performed six months before admission showed dense infiltrations mainly below the ventral subpleural area in the right upper lobe and right middle lobe. As these shadows did not improve with oral antibiotic therapy, he was admitted to our hospital for a further examination and treatment. The shadows were enlarged on admission; thus, we suspected exacerbation of chronic lung inflammation or organizing pneumonia. On auscultation, a pleural friction rub was heard in the right chest.

Therefore, bronchoscopy was performed to target pulmonary infiltrations for further investigation. No microorganisms or malignant cells were identified in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. A pathological analysis of the transbronchial lung biopsy specimen did not reveal any malignancy or specific inflammation. Chest MRI showed no abnormalities in the spine or spinal cord but did show some nodules around the right pleura and right pleural effusion.

Subsequent thoracoscopy revealed multiple white nodules in the right parietal pleura, some of which were in the right thoracic area as one of the first clinical manifestations of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. We should consider the possibility of pleural diseases, including metastatic lung cancer, when encountering patients presenting with unilateral thoracic hyperhidrosis.
