Examining the differential of digital ischaemia and review of paraneoplastic ischaemia.

There is a broad differential diagnosis of digital ischaemia that includes commonly encountered conditions of vascular or thromboembolic nature as well as less commonly seen such as those of vasculitic or rheumatological origin. A less frequently encountered pathology is digital ischaemia associated with malignancy. This paraneoplastic process is rare and infrequently described in the literature, though it has been observed in various solid and haematological malignancies. Here, we describe a patient case with an atypical presentation of digital ischaemia and present a brief review on prior reports of digital ischaemia related to cancer.

Background: The differential diagnoses of digital ischaemia include atherosclerotic vascular disease, thromboembolic disease, toxic metabolite-induced ischaemia, rheumatological disease, vasculitis and less commonly recognised disease processes such as paraneoplastic syndromes. Digital ischaemia associated with cancer (DIAC) is thought to be a rare paraneoplastic pathology that has previously been reported to coincide with, follow or precede a diagnosis of malignancy in a patient. Little is known of the pathophysiology with literature limited to a small number of case reports, case series or cohort studies with proposed mechanisms including vasospasm caused by overproduction of vasoconstrictive factors, intraluminal thrombosis, vasculitis, immune complex deposition or drug toxicity associated with treatment of the malignancy. Initially described in gastrointestinal and gynaecological malignancies, cases in both haematological malignancy and other solid tumours have since been reported with adenocarcinoma as the most frequently found underlying histopathology. We present a case of a patient with an atypical presentation of digital ischaemia, examine the differential and review a less commonly considered diagnosis of DIAC.
