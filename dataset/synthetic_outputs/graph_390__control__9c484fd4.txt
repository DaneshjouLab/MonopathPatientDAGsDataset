A patient was diagnosed with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), specifically ALK-rearranged NSCLC, which presented as metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung with bone metastases, liver metastases, and adrenal distant metastases. The patient was initially treated with crizotinib, an ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), achieving a partial response followed by stable disease. Upon disease progression, the patient was subsequently treated with ceritinib and then alectinib, both ALK TKIs. Following further disease progression, the patient received chemotherapy consisting of carboplatin and pemetrexed, resulting in disease stabilisation. The patient was then treated with lorlatinib, leading to delayed disease progression. Genetic testing revealed the presence of G1202R and G1269A mutations. Brigatinib was also considered as a treatment option.
