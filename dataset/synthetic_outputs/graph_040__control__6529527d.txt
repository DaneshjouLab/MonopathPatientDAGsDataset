We present a unique case of polymicrobial pyogenic pericarditis, mediastinitis, and death in a patient who underwent Endobronchial ultrasound transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) for the evaluation of solitary mediastinal lymphadenopathy in the background of previously resected renal cell carcinoma. There were no complications during her procedure and her mediastinal lymph node biopsy confirmed metastatic renal cell carcinoma. However, 23 days after her procedure, she presented to the emergency department with sepsis and cardiac tamponade. Pericardial fluid cultures and computed tomography imaging confirmed polymicrobial pyogenic pericarditis and mediastinitis. While complications from EBUS-TBNA are rare, clinicians need to be aware that pericarditis and mediastinitis are possible life-threatening complications in order to facilitate early recognition and interventions.
