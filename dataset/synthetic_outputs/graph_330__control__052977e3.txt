Miliary intrapulmonary carcinomatosis (MIPC) is very rare. This case report describes a 57-year-old woman who presented with dry cough, intermittent chest wall and back pain for 3 weeks. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan revealed over 200 uniform size pulmonary nodules in an evenly dispersed pattern throughout both lungs. A 38x45mm mass was also identified in the dorsal segment of the lower lobe of the left lung. The patient was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma presenting as MIPC. This rare presentation of lung cancer, characterized by numerous pulmonary nodules, highlights the potential challenges in diagnosis and the need for further exploration of artificial intelligence (AI) applications in such cases.
