A 63-year-old woman presented with a one-month history of cough and blood in sputum. Physical examination revealed cachexia. Initial CT chest imaging showed two right-lower lobe lung nodules, with the largest nodule measuring 2.1 cm, as well as a pleural-based nodule and enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. CT abdomen and pelvis revealed a pancreatic mass. Further imaging with MRI of the brain showed several nodular densities suggestive of metastatic disease, including a nodule in the right cerebellar hemisphere and a nodule in the right occipital lobe. These findings prompted a bronchoscopy, where endobronchial biopsies were obtained from the right-lower lobe lesions. Bronchial brushings were positive for malignant cells. Initial biopsy results revealed clusters of atypical cells with severe crushing effects consistent with Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC). Immunohistochemistry confirmed SCLC with EGFR positive for Exon 21 2573T>G L858R mutation as well as a high proliferative index (ki-67, 80%), and positive TTF-1 and synaptophysin. Tumor cells were negative for chromogranin and p63. Based on these findings, the patient was classified as Stage IV SCLC and started on targeted therapy with osimertinib. After two months of osimertinib treatment, the patient's clinical status worsened, requiring hospitalization for pneumonia and a new pleural effusion. Follow-up CT was planned.
