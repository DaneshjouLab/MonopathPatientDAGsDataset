In May 2022, a 61-year-old female with a history of osteoporosis and a former smoker (2 packs/year) presented with severe and rapid deterioration in general condition, severe asthenia, complete anorexia, nausea, and epigastric pain. Clinical examination revealed painful hepatomegaly. Hepatic sonogram showed diffuse bilobar lesions.

On June 7, a CT scan showed diffuse hepatic lesions, multiple sus and sub-diaphragmatic lymphadenopathies, pleural effusion, diffuse bone and pulmonary lesions.

On June 15, a liver biopsy revealed CK7+; CK20-; TTF1+; SATB2-; GATA 3- mucus-secreting carcinoma, leading to a diagnosis of T1aN3M1c bronchopulmonary adenocarcinoma.

On June 17, blood tests revealed anemia with hemoglobin at 7.5 g/dL, INR increase at 1.51, hepatic enzymes increase with gamma-glutamyltransferase at 458 U/L, alkaline phosphatase at 703 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase at 156 U/L, alanine aminotransferase at 129 U/L, total bilirubin increase at 56.9 \u00b5mol/L, and conjugated bilirubin increase at 32.6 \u00b5mol/L. Viral serologies were negative for Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, HIV, and Cytomegalovirus. Patient's ECOG PS was 3, and oxygen was needed at 1-2 L/min.

The patient was hospitalized due to suspicion of acute liver failure. Treatment was initially postponed pending tumor molecular biology results. On June 21, a liquid biopsy was performed to research ctDNA alterations.

The patient developed encephalopathy due to hepatic failure and salvage chemotherapy was initiated with weekly paclitaxel/carboplatin regimen.

48 hours post-chemotherapy, the patient developed a massive hematoma in front of central venous catheter associated with clinical degradation and increase of oxygen need to 4 L/min.

Blood tests revealed grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelet count decrease) according to CTCAE v5.0, leading to an initial diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

Subsequent analysis revealed anemia, negative haptoglobin, and schizocytes on blood smear, rectifying the diagnosis to paraneoplastic thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA).

A new CT-scan showed massive pleural and peritoneal effusion.

Antitumor treatment was stopped and focusing on best supportive care.

On June 21, ctDNA analysis by ddPCR revealed EGFRDEL19 mutation with 736,400 copies/mL of plasma.
