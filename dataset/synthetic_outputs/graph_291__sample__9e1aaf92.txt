A 68-year-old man presented with a mass (61.7 mm x 43.9 mm) near the left hilum in the left upper lobe, discovered on CT scan. A PET scan revealed increased FDG accumulation in the left upper lobe mass (SUV: 15.08) and an enlarged left hilar lymph node (SUV: 5.78). Bronchoscopy confirmed a mass at the origin of the left upper lobe bronchus.

Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with clinical T3N2M0 pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma via bronchoscopic biopsy.

The patient was scheduled for neoadjuvant therapy consisting of paclitaxel (210 mg), carboplatin (0.5 g), and tislelizumab (200 mg) administered monthly for 3 months. However, after receiving 17 ml of intravenous paclitaxel, the patient complained of chest pain. Consequently, chemotherapy was discontinued, and the chest pain resolved. The patient then received three cycles of tislelizumab immunotherapy.

Following immunotherapy, a PET examination showed a mass size of 45 mm x 44 mm with an SUV of 12.31, indicating stable disease (SD).

Preoperative contrast-enhanced CT revealed tumor infiltration of the left upper bronchus and pulmonary artery. Contrast-enhanced CT revealed that the tumor invaded the left upper bronchus and the left upper artery.
