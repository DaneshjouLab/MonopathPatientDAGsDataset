A 51-year-old male, non-smoker presented with a 3.4 cm mass in the right middle lobe and was diagnosed with large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC). Fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene translocation, confirmed by immunohistochemistry using ALK-Ventana. Radiographic examinations showed both bone and brain metastasis. The patient was initially treated with two cycles of chemotherapy consisting of etoposide and cisplatin, achieving stable disease. He was then switched to crizotinib. After 4 months of crizotinib treatment, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a partial response. However, after 10 months of crizotinib, the disease progressed, and several hard lymph nodes were palpable in the left supraclavicular fossa. A lymph node biopsy showed similar histology of tumor cells. Targeted next-generation sequencing revealed ALK F1174L on exon 23, along with two rare forms of ALK rearrangements.
