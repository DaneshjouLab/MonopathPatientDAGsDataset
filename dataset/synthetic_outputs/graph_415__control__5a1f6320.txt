A 50-year-old Japanese woman with no history of asbestos exposure or smoking developed malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) 25 years after receiving thoracic radiation therapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma. At age 25, she had undergone chemotherapy with mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisolone, along with radiation therapy. The irradiated lesions were localized in the mediastinum (50 Gray/25 fractions) and abdomen (56 Gray/28 fractions) as the primary and recurrence sites, respectively.

Five years after the radiation therapy, chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a small amount of left pleural effusion. Due to the small volume, thoracentesis was not performed, and follow-up with chest CT and X-ray was continued, considering radiation pleuritis. The pleural effusion and thickness increased after 20 years of follow-up, prompting her to seek evaluation at the reporting hospital.

This case is reported as the first in Japan of MPM developing in a long-term survivor of a primary malignancy with a history of thoracic radiation therapy. The patient's lack of asbestos exposure suggests that the radiation therapy was the likely cause of the MPM. The report emphasizes the need for long-term follow-up after thoracic radiation therapy to monitor for secondary malignancies, including MPM, especially with advancements in radiation treatment leading to improved long-term survival.
