A 53-year-old man presented with cough and a mediastinal tumor. He was diagnosed with malignant pleural mesothelioma, clinical stage III (T2 N1 M0) based on pleural biopsy. The patient received two courses of chemotherapy with cisplatin and pemetrexed. Subsequently, he underwent right-sided extrapleural pneumonectomy with pericardial resection, and pericardial and diaphragmatic reconstruction with expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) sheets. He was then transferred to the postoperative care unit. 18 hours postoperatively, the patient complained of feeling unwell and developed hypotension (89/57 mmHg with noradrenaline 0.015 \u03bcg/kg/min). Chest radiography revealed cardiac herniation into the right-sided thoracic cavity. The patient underwent emergency thoracotomy for cardiac herniation repair secondary to tearing of sutures on the posterior aspect of the ePTFE sheet. The heart was placed back within the pericardium and tears were repaired by fixing another ePTFE sheet to close the defect between the posterior pericardium and the previously placed ePTFE sheet.
