A 48-year-old female, an active smoker with a 36 pack-year history, was followed up for sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) since 2004. A CT scan of the chest revealed diffuse bilateral cysts with thin walls typical of LAM, in addition to retroperitoneal involvement with left iliac, hypogastric, and latero-aortic angiomyolipomas. Biopsy confirmed angiomyolipoma. In 2006, the patient developed New York Heart Association Class II dyspnea on exercise, along with a chronic cough. From 2006 to 2007, the patient received sequential anti-estrogen treatments including tamoxifen and letrozole combined with triptorelin, with stable respiratory function. In 2007, the patient exhibited lung function deterioration, which led to the prescription of sirolimus (2 mg once daily), resulting in the disappearance of retroperitoneal lesions. In 2013, a CT scan showed a right apical lung mass, highly suggestive of cancer, due to its size, radiological features, and hypermetabolism (SUVmax = 4.8) on TEP-CT. Sirolimus was stopped. Follow up CT scan was performed.
