A 68-year-old Chinese female non-smoker presented in June 2019 with cough, bloody sputum, and slight shortness of breath for more than 2 months. A CT scan in June 2019 revealed a mass in the right pulmonary lower lobe and no bronchial or lymph node lesions. The patient underwent a radical resection of the right lower lobe. Pathological examination showed TTF-1(-), CgA(-), Syn(-), NapsinA(-), P40(-), CD5/6(-), CD56(-), MelanA(-), SOX-10(-), S100(-), HMB45(-), KI67 60%(+), CK(+), CKL(+), CKH(+). The initial diagnosis was stage Ib LCLC. One month after the operation, a color ultrasound scan presented a right upper arm metastasis. Multiple fulminant body and mouth lesions were found in the right upper arm, right elbow, right waist, and tongue root. Serum neuron specific enolase (NSE) concentration dramatically increased from 12.12 to 30.14 ng/ml. The lesions were surgically removed for pathological examination.
