A 76-year-old man, a former smoker with a history of arterial hypertension and coronary artery bypass grafting surgery, developed a cough associated with blood-tinged sputum. This prompted further investigation, and a thoracic computed tomography (CT) scan showed an irregular mass in the left hilum (47 mm × 23 mm). The CT scan findings led to bronchoscopy for further evaluation. Flexible bronchoscopy showed extrinsic compression of the apical segment of the left lower lobe bronchi. Bronchoscopy findings prompted a transbronchial lung biopsy, which was suggestive of IgG4-RD. Biopsy results and normal serum IgG4 levels prompted a positron emission tomography scan, which revealed a high uptake of fluorodeoxyglucose in the mass (maximum standardized uptake was 4.6). Based on imaging findings, the patient was started on prednisone 40 mg daily. The patient developed Cushing syndrome, leading to a reduction in prednisone dosage, which was halved after 1 month. Despite prednisone treatment, the left hilar mass enlarged (50 mm × 22 mm) after 6 months. Enlargement of the mass led to a left lower lobectomy via thoracotomy. The lobectomy specimen was sent for histopathology. Histopathology of the left lower lobectomy specimen revealed no malignancy, fibrotic areas, infiltration of IgG4+ plasma cells (20 IgG4+/high-power field), and obliterative phlebitis. Histopathology results led to a diagnosis of IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD). Two months after diagnosis, the patient reported dyspnoea. Dyspnoea prompted a thoracic CT scan, which showed a large-volume left pleural effusion (PE). CT scan findings of pleural effusion led to video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) in order to drain the PE and to perform a pleural biopsy; pleural biopsy results were negative.
