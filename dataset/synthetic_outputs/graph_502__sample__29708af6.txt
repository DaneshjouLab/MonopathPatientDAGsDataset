A sixty-four-year-old Chinese woman with a ten-year history of diabetes and hypertension presented with serious dizziness and vomiting in a month. Positron emission tomography (PET) indicated a nodular lesion in left upper lung with diffuse bilateral lung metastases and multiple intraventricular masses. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain showed a mass at the posterior horn of the right lateral ventricle and the IV ventricle, respectively. T1 brain MRI showed isointense lesions with heterogeneous enhancement on contrast. T2 brain MRI showed hyperintense masses, remarkable dilation and hydrocephalus of upper cerebral ventricle and parenchyma edema around encephalocoele. There was no obvious involvement of brain parenchyma. Chest CT showed a 1 cm x 1 cm irregular nodule in the upper lobe of left lung, with diffuse bilateral pulmonary metastases. Contrast-enhanced MRI of brain showed heterogeneously enhancing lesions at the posterior horn of the right lateral ventricle and the IV ventricle, with upper ventricle hydrocephalus and edema of the surrounding parenchyma. T2FLAIR brain MRI showed slightly higher signal of the masses. Lung adenocarcinoma was histopathologically diagnosed by endobronchial ultrasound transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA). EGFR mutation in exon 18 (G719X) was identified. Afatinib was administered at a dose of 30 mg qd. Symptoms improved significantly within one month of Afatinib treatment. Three months after Afatinib treatment, reevaluation showed partial remission in both lung and brain lesions. Bilateral lung nodules evidently shrunk. Intraventricular lesions and surrounding area of edema observably shrunk with restored ventricular dilatation. Repeated CT of chest showed bilateral pulmonary nodules increased and enlarged, while intracerebral lesions remained stable. Ten months after targeted therapy, lesions of lung progressed. Masses in the brain remain stable. Severe headache and dizziness reoccurred half a month later and the symptoms aggravated rapidly afterwards. Further progression of disease.
