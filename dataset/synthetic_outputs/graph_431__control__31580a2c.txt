We report a case of a 38-year-old male patient who presented with polyserous effusions and pneumonia. He was treated accordingly and showed clinical improvement with a significant reduction of pericardial and pleural effusions. However, any polyserous effusions at a young age must always be suspicious for malignancy. Subsequent testing and a biopsy resulted in the histopathological diagnosis of an adenocarcinoma of the lung. This case highlights the diagnostic challenges posed by atypical presentations of lung adenocarcinoma and emphasizes the importance of considering malignancy in the differential diagnosis of polyserous effusions, even when initial cytology results are negative. Clinicians should remain vigilant for false-negative results, especially in younger patients. Nonrecurrent polyserous effusions in lung adenocarcinoma are uncommon, and negative cytology results may not exclude malignancy due to the moderate sensitivity of pleural and pericardial fluid cytology. The coexistence of lung cancer and polyserous effusions is uncommon, which may cause a diagnostic challenge. Due to the difficulty in differentiating lung adenocarcinoma from pneumonia when it presents as parenchymal consolidation, diagnosis of the condition is frequently delayed.
