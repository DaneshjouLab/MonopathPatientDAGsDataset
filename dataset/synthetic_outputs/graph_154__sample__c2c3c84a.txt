A 67-year-old woman presented with a three-year history of progressive loss of strength affecting proximal muscles in upper and lower limbs, marked by difficulties in climbing stairs and walking. Symptoms initially fluctuated but became continuous at the time of assessment. No bulbar or respiratory symptoms were reported.

The patient had a past medical history of small cell carcinoma of the lung treated with carboplatin and etoposide. She was a smoker since age 16 and a moderate alcohol drinker. Manual muscle strength testing revealed 5-/5 in proximal upper limbs and 4+/5 in proximal lower limbs. Sensation was preserved to all modalities.

Based on these findings, a diagnosis of Myasthenia Gravis (MG) was considered and subsequently confirmed via repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) and single-fibre electromyography (EMG). Bicipital, patellar and Achilles deep tendon reflexes were absent bilaterally. Electroneurography (nerve conduction studies (NCS)) revealed normal motor and sensory conduction velocities and expected characteristics of the evoked potentials.

Needle EMG of the right vastus lateralis muscle showed no abnormalities. RNS test of the right median nerve showed a >10% amplitude drop from the fourth to the first potential. Single-fibre EMG of the right vastus lateralis muscle showed increased jitter in four of six pairs, with an increased average jitter value and one block.

Single-fibre EMG of the right vastus lateralis muscle showed the presence of an increased jitter and blocking. Anti-acetylcholine receptor (anti-AchR) antibodies (Ab) testing was initially negative (0.38 IU/mL), then showed a grey area of positivity (0.75 IU/mL). After one year, a control analysis showed a positive anti-AchR Ab value of 1.15 IU/mL.

Chest radiograph and computerised tomography (CT) showed no thymoma.
