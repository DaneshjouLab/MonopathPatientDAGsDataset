A patient presented with abdominal pain, fatigue, increased abdominal girth, and weight loss. Initial evaluation revealed ascites. Further investigation included ultrasonography and cross-sectional imaging, specifically computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) scans. Pleural fluid analysis was also performed.

The imaging and fluid analysis led to suspicion of malignancy, prompting tissue acquisition via biopsy. Histology, immunohistochemical markers, and molecular testing were utilized to confirm the diagnosis of malignant peritoneal mesothelioma.

Differential diagnoses considered included cirrhosis, portal hypertension (potentially due to portal or splenic vein thrombosis or compression), primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, schistosomiasis, sarcoidosis, and constrictive pericarditis. The presence of ascites raised concerns for inflammation and infection as well.

Treatment strategies included cytoreductive surgery, radiation therapy, intraperitoneal chemotherapy, and systemic chemotherapy. The patient's clinical course and outcomes following these interventions are not specified in this data.
