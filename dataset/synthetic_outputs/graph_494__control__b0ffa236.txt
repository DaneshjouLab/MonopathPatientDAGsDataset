A patient developed both lung and prostate cancers, both harboring the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion. The patient initially developed cancer of the prostate with lymph node metastases. Two years later, a nodule appeared on the thoracic wall. Histology and immunohistochemical profiling confirmed the presence of both prostate and lung cancers. Next-generation sequencing demonstrated the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion in both malignancies. Initially, the lung nodule was suspected to be a metastasis from the prostate cancer. The patient failed to respond to antiandrogen therapy. Chemotherapy for lung cancer, however, led to a significant objective response. This case is notable as the first reported instance of a lung cancer harboring the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion. The TMPRSS2:ERG fusion is a frequent genetic alteration in prostate cancer, and its occurrence in other tumors is rare.
