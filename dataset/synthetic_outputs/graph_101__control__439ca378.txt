A patient presented with symptoms including dry cough, shortness of breath (SOB), cough, joint swelling, tenderness of fingers and ankles, rash, photosensitivity, and ulcerative symptoms. Initial investigations, including a CT chest, revealed a moderate 2 to 3 cm cavitary mass in the left lower lobe (LLL) and left hilar adenopathy. Bronchoscopy was performed. The patient was diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) adenocarcinoma, specifically a 2.9 cm moderately differentiated NSCLC adenocarcinoma in the LLL. The primary mass adhered to the visceral pleura, and intralobar pulmonary metastasis vs. a satellite lesion was noted. Positive lymph nodes were found in stations 4L and 12L, and the bronchial stump had a positive margin.

Further investigation revealed the patient also had an autoimmune disease, specifically MDA5+ and PL7-positive dermatomyositis subtype, consistent with antisynthetase syndrome. The patient experienced symptoms related to dermatomyositis, including joint swelling, rash, photosensitivity, and tenderness. The patient also had lung disease, specifically interstitial lung disease (ILD).

Later, the patient developed a tracheoesophageal fistula and mild grade 2 esophagitis. The patient experienced autoimmune relief at some point, but also experienced immune flares. A hematoma was also noted. The bronchial stump continued to show a positive margin.
