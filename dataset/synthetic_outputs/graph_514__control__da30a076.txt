A patient presented with locally advanced anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The patient had a high-density nodule located in the right upper lobe and enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes with discrete 4R and 10R. The clinical stage was IIIA (cT2N2M0). The patient was diagnosed with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemistry showed positive staining of cytokeratin AE1/AE3, thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), and Napsin A. ALK fusion status was positive, with 45.7% rearranged cells in FISH.

The patient received neoadjuvant alectinib therapy. After one cycle of treatment, the tumor shrunk 42.2%. Partial remission (PR) was achieved without any side effects, and the tumor stage didnâ€™t degrade. The patient then underwent video assistant thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), including right upper lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node dissection. Pathologic evaluation about tumor was assessed by hematoxylin and eosin staining. The residual viable tumor cells were 15%, and major pathologic response (MPR) was not achieved.

Because mediastinal station 4R lymphadenectomy excluded with serious tissue adhesion and MPR status was not met, radiotherapy (RT) was given. The patient continually received adjuvant alectinib. Neoadjuvant alectinib therapy was feasible and well tolerated in locally advanced ALK positive NSCLC. The patient also experienced hypertension. This case demonstrates the potential of neoadjuvant and adjuvant alectinib in advanced ALK-positive NSCLC.
