A 49-year-old male with no past medical history presented with cough that worsened over the past two weeks prior to his initial presentation, becoming persistent and productive of yellow sputum with occasional hemoptysis. This was associated with intermittent right-sided chest pain, but he denied shortness of breath, fever, and weight loss. A chest X-ray 4 days prior to presentation showed a well-circumscribed lobulated mass within the posteromedial right upper lobe of the lung. A computed tomography (CT) scan performed a few days later further characterized the opacity as a 6.6×6.0×5.9 cm<sup>3</sup> solid, heterogeneous mass in the superior right upper lobe, obliterating the right upper bronchus and abutting the pleura. He then presented with acute worsening of chronic cough, new onset hemoptysis and left sided chest pain for 2 weeks. Workup revealed stage IIIB NUT midline carcinoma (NMC) of the lung with next-generation sequencing confirming the presence of a NUTM1-BRD4 fusion. The follow-up CT scan showed partial response, so maintenance was continued with durvalumab. Two months later, he presented with metastasis to the posterior muscle compartment of the left arm, which was treated with local radiotherapy. Four months later he developed progression of lung disease with multiple pulmonary nodules. After nearly 3 months of treatment with molibresib, he presented with brain metastasis for which he had a craniotomy with tumor resection and gamma knife radiation to solitary metastatic lesions. After two cycles of treatment his disease progressed, and he succumbed to it.
