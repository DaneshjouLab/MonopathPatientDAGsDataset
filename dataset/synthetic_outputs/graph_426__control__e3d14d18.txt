A 65-year-old never-smoker woman weighing 62 kg presented to the hospital in July 2009 with persistent severe mid-back pain. A bone scan on July 6, 2009, showed increased 99mTc-labeled methylene diphosphonate uptake at the thoracic 12 level and the third right rib, in addition to the hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy (HPOA) of bilateral femurs and tibias, which were compatible with bone metastases. Right pleural malignant effusion was also apparent. Lung and metastatic bone lesion biopsies revealed small tumor cells forming a sheet-like growth pattern with scant cytoplasm, finely granular chromatin, nuclear molding, necrosis, and frequent mitosis. From July 20 until September 21, 2009, three cycles of full-dose paclitaxel + cisplatin were administered and then discontinued because of grade III sensory neuropathy by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). Follow-up chest CT showed partial remission. Gradual improvement of the sensory neuropathy down to CTCAE grade I was noted. Chest CT on July 7, 2012, revealed complete regression of the lung ADC with fibrotic changes. In April 2013, the patient developed bilateral leg weakness resulting from spinal cord compression. Spinal cord compression at thoracic-12 level from SCCT was successfully relieved with neurosurgical treatment, chemotherapy with etoposide and cisplatin, and radiotherapy, while gefitinib treatment was maintained. A course of IMRT with 30 Gy/10 fractions/13 days was administered to the T-11 to L1 spinal metastases from April 25 to May 7, 2013. Complete remission occurred with no tumor activity, normal lactate dehydrogenase level, and improving performance status. On March 26, 2014, a subcentimeter nodule was noted in the right upper lung lobe. Eleven months later, SCCT relapsed in the lung parenchyma, which was resected and was found to be sensitive to second-line weekly topotecan. At the 12th-year follow-up, the patient remains relapse free with very good performance status.
