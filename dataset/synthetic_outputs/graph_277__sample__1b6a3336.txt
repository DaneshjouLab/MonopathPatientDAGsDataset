A 62-year-old female with a history of acute biliary pancreatitis in December 2021 underwent routine magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography in May 2023. The imaging showed no changes regarding intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm, but suspicious consolidations were noted in the bilateral basal parts of the lungs. Further investigation with CT scans of the thorax, abdomen, and cranium, along with a CT-guided biopsy of the left lower lung lobe consolidation, confirmed metastatic mucinous adenocarcinoma, KRAS-positive, MetFusion, PDL-1 0%, grade T2N0M1a. On August 22, 2023, the patient started chemo/immunotherapy with nivolumab, ipilimumab, pemetrexed, and carboplatin. She received a second cycle of carboplatin, pemetrexed, and nivolumab on September 12, 2023. On October 5, 2023, the patient received a third cycle of ipilimumab plus nivolumab. On October 19, 2023, at 12:50 PM, 14 days after the last ipilimumab plus nivolumab application, the patient presented to the infectious disease emergency department with malaise, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and fever.
