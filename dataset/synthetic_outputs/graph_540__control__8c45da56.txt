A patient with pre-existing vitiligo was diagnosed with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), specifically lung adenocarcinoma. The patient was treated with anti-programmed cell death-1 therapy. During the course of treatment, the patient developed hypothyroidism. The patient's medical history also included autoimmune conditions and a concern for the development of other autoimmune diseases. The patient's case is relevant to the study of autoimmune diseases in the context of cancers, specifically in NSCLC patients treated with immunotherapy, and the potential for immune-related adverse events like vitiligo and hypothyroidism. The case also touches upon the relationship between melanoma and other cancers.
