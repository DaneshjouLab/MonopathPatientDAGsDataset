A 64-year-old man presented with a 6-month history of cough and 2 months of shortness of breath. He had a history of smoking 10 cigarettes per day for 15 years, but quit 1 year prior to presentation. He had no other significant medical history. One month prior to presentation, a chest skiagram and CT of the chest performed at an outside hospital revealed a left lung mass.

Further investigation included a CT-guided biopsy of the lung mass, which revealed necrotic material, prompting a PET scan. Clinical examination revealed a respiratory rate of 18 per minute, and impaired percussion note along with decreased intensity of breath sounds over the left upper hemithorax. Laboratory investigations revealed a haemoglobin of 116 g/L (normal range 130–170 g/L), and total cell counts of 10.9 × 109/L (normal 4–11×109/L) with a differential of 60% polymorphs, 18.7% lymphocytes, 11.9% eosinophils and 8.6% monocytes. Total serum protein was 8.1 g/dL (normal range 6.6–8.3 g/dL), and albumin was 3.3 g/dL (normal range 3.5–5.2 g/dL).

PET-CT revealed a FDG-avid left lingular lung mass measuring 89×88×71 mL with SUVmax of 14.35, and an FDG avid intraluminal plug (SUVmax 8.13) within the left upper lobe bronchus, with enlarged FDG avid subcarinal lymph node and complete lingular collapse. Bronchoscopy revealed an endoluminal plug with jelly-like consistency completely occluding the left upper lobe bronchus. The left upper lobe lumen was cleared using a combination of biopsy forceps and snare, and a lingular growth was identified from which a biopsy was taken. Histopathology revealed necrotic fragments with colonisation of fungal organisms morphologically resembling Aspergillus, along with infiltration of the subepithelium with atypical cells. By immunohistochemistry, the latter cells were positive for vimentin and thyroid transcription factor-1, and were negative for EBV-LMP1, p63, synaptophysin and chromogranin, favouring a diagnosis of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of lung.
