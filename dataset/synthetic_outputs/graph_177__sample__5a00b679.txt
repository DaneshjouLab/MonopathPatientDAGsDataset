A 65-year-old man with a medical history of right renal pelvis cancer 12 years prior and bladder cancer 11 years prior, and a current smoker with a 45 pack-year history, was referred to the hospital due to findings suggestive of primary lung cancer. The patient reported no asbestos exposure.

CT imaging revealed an 18-mm spiculated nodule in the right middle lobe. Preoperative CT imaging also showed a 10-mm pleural soft tissue density nodule with osteal protrusion anterior to the tubercle of the right sixth rib.

During intraoperative examination, it was observed that the pleural lesion arose from the parietal pleura, not the visceral pleura, and exhibited a whitish lobulated shape.

The resected pleural lesion was sent for pathological examination. Macroscopic findings showed a 10-mm whitish solid nodule. Microscopic examination revealed benign fibrous tissue with layered collagen fibers, leading to a diagnosis of reactive fibrous tissue rather than a fibrous tumor.

The spiculated nodule in the right middle lobe was also sent for pathological examination and was diagnosed as papillary adenocarcinoma.
