Based on the provided data, the clinical case report appears to describe a patient with lung adenocarcinoma who developed a series of severe cardiac complications. The patient initially presented with febrile and infectious symptoms, including fever. The timeline suggests the patient experienced a cascade of events: lung adenocarcinoma, followed by pneumonitis and liver/metastatic lesions, then acute myocarditis and pericarditis, potentially leading to fulminant myocarditis and cardiogenic shock. Hypotension and sinus tachycardia were also noted. Myocardial oedema and pericardial effusion were observed, further supporting the diagnosis of myocarditis and pericarditis. QT interval prolongation was also present. The patient also experienced acute ischaemia and blurred vision. The case ultimately involved heart failure and potentially infective endocarditis. The outcome is not specified in the provided data.
