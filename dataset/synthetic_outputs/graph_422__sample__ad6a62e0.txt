A 45-year-old Chinese woman was admitted for treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). On November 21, 2017, she underwent thoracoscopic right middle and lower lobectomy, partial left atrial resection, pericardiotomy, and lymph node dissection. Histopathological diagnosis revealed Stage IIIC adenocarcinoma of the right middle lobe (pT4N3M0). There was no tumor involvement in the parenchyma of the right lower lobe, but cancer infiltration was present in the left atrial wall and left parabronchial bronchi. Metastasis was also detected in some mediastinal lymph nodes. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) detected an EGFR exon 19 deletion mutation. The patient was started on icotinib (125 mg/d, tid). Eight months after icotinib treatment, a CT scan showed metastases in the liver, and icotinib was discontinued. Chemotherapy was performed for 24 days. A subsequent CT scan revealed thoracic spine metastasis, suggestive of prior treatment failure. The patient then began receiving icotinib combined with bevacizumab. Six months later, icotinib and bevacizumab were switched to chemotherapy.
