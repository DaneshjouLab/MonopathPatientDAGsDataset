A 59-year-old male with a history of lung adenocarcinoma, staged as cT1bN2M0 Stage IIIA, was initially diagnosed and began chemotherapy 10 years prior to presentation. He received 10 different anticancer drugs over this period, with cycles of growth and reduction of the cancer, but never achieved complete remission. Two years prior to presentation, cervical spine metastasis was detected. The patient underwent radiation therapy (20Gy/5Fr) for the cervical metastasis.

Three days before presentation, the patient experienced sudden neck pain during farming work, followed by progressive quadriparesis and urinary dysfunction. On presentation to the emergency department, he could walk with assistance, but his symptoms worsened during examination. He developed quadriparesis (manual muscle testing (MMT) grading: 1/5), bilateral hand sensory disturbance, and urinary retention.

Emergency MRI revealed cervical epidural fluid collection with spinal cord compression. A cervical MRI taken two months prior to presentation showed no evident epidural fluid collection. Acute cervical epidural hematoma was suspected, and emergency surgery was performed, including drainage and partial C3 laminectomy, complete C4,5 laminectomy, and partial C6 laminectomy for decompression. Intraoperative findings showed no clear hematoma but light yellow serous exudate in the epidural space. The intradural space was examined but appeared normal without hematoma.
