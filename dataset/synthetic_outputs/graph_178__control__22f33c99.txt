A patient presented with symptoms including dyspnea, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, and jaundice, indicative of a significant disease burden. The jaundice was determined to be obstructive in nature. Initial laboratory findings revealed elevated alkaline phosphatase levels, hyperbilirubinemia, and transaminitis. Imaging studies of the lungs showed pulmonary parenchymal nodules and a left lower lobe mass with consolidation. Further investigation revealed a heterogeneous mass in the pancreatic head, a dilated common bile duct, and enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes, suggesting metastasis. Biopsy confirmed the presence of metastatic cancer cells consistent with lung adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemical staining showed thyroid transcription factor âˆ’ 1 and cytokeratin-7 expression, while tumor protein 63 staining was negative, further supporting the diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma. The patient was diagnosed with primary lung adenocarcinoma with metastasis to the pancreas, liver, bones, and central nervous system. The pancreatic involvement resulted in obstructive jaundice. The patient's condition was considered life-threatening due to the extensive metastases. The primary lung cancer had metastasized, forming pancreatic tumors.
