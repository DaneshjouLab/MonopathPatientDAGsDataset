A 68-year-old man with a history of endoscopic resection of a colon polyp 1 year prior and a 48-year history of smoking two packs of cigarettes per day, presented with neck lymphadenopathy. After detailed examinations, he was diagnosed with squamous cell lung carcinoma (cT2aN3M1c). Chest CT revealed a tumor in the right upper lobe with hypertrophy of the bronchovascular bundles. Despite treatment with cisplatin combined with gemcitabine, his cancerous lymphangiopathy was exacerbated, and Zosteriform skin metastasis (ZSM) was observed on his right chest. Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography indicated the presence of skin metastasis and cancerous lymphangiopathy. After performing an autopsy, tumor-cell filled lymph ducts were observed in the right subclavian and the cutaneous lymphatic vessel from the right hilar lymph nodes.
