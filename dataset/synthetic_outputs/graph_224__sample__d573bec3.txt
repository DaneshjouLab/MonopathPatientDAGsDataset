A 67-year-old right-handed female presented to the hospital with a headache which began the day prior. The patient, with no known cancer history, presented with aneurysmal hemorrhage, initially presumed to be mycotic in etiology due to the lesion’s location and morphology. Intraoperative pathology revealed non-small-cell adenocarcinoma. Imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis did not reveal a culprit lesion, rendering lung adenocarcinoma an unlikely source and leaving breast adenocarcinoma as the leading primary diagnosis among adenocarcinoma of other distant sites.

Head CT revealed a 4.7 x 3.8 x 2.2 cm right parietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage and 1 cm left parietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage. CTA revealed a spot sign with vascular pouch in the region of the right-sided hemorrhage, raising concern for mycotic aneurysm or a dural AV fistula. The patient was neurologically intact upon initial presentation.

The patient suddenly became lethargic with facial asymmetry and left hemiparesis. Repeat head CT revealed enlargement of the right-sided hematoma to 5.8 × 5.5 × 5.0 cm with 1.3 cm brain compression and midline shift. Right parietal hemorrhage and left parietal hemorrhage were noted. Axial CTA revealed the vascular lesion in the hematoma. Axial non-contrast head CT revealed expanding intraparenchymal hemorrhage pattern with mass effect. Angiogram revealed a distal cortical middle cerebral artery (MCA) fusiform aneurysm, raising suspicion for mycotic etiology given the location. The patient underwent stereotactic right parietal minicraniotomy.

Partial intraparenchymal hematoma evacuation was performed. A pseudoaneurysm capsule was identified along the distal posterior parietal MCA branches with two clear superficial outflow vessels. The aneurysm was isolated and excised; the specimen was sent for pathology and cultures. Transesophageal echocardiogram was negative for endocarditis or atrial myxoma. Intraoperative and blood cultures were negative for infectious process.

Head CTs demonstrated small contralateral hemorrhage without evidence of vascular pathology or metastatic disease on cerebral angiography or MRI. Pathology was consistent with metastatic non-small-cell adenocarcinoma within the aneurysmal wall, with immunohistochemistry staining positive for CK7 and negative for CK 5/6, CK 20, TTF-1, and p63. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was obtained and was negative for a malignancy source. Histopathology was reviewed by multiple pathologists, with breast cancer determined as the most likely source of the adenocarcinomatous morphology, especially in the context of negative CT chest/abdomen/ pelvis. Pseudoaneurysm detected angiographically. Microsurgical resection performed with hematoma evacuation. PET scan planned to determine the location of the underlying malignancy.
