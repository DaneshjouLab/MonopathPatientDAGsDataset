A patient presented with a complex clinical picture involving pulmonary and systemic manifestations. The patient experienced symptoms including cough, fever, and weight loss, suggestive of a possible underlying condition. Initial investigations revealed the presence of pneumonia and raised suspicion for lung cancer. Further complicating the presentation were oral and extra-oral infections, raising concerns about a potential source of hematogenous spread.

The patient's condition deteriorated, leading to respiratory distress. Invasive pneumonia was diagnosed, necessitating treatment with antibiotics. Despite the antibiotic therapy, the patient's condition remained challenging, leading to a diagnostic dilemma between an infectious process and malignancy. Tissue biopsies were performed to further investigate the possibility of lung cancer.

The patient also reported shoulder pain, and imaging revealed bone destruction and soft tissue inflammation, potentially indicating osteo-articular or soft tissue involvement. Brachial plexopathy was also noted. The possibility of tuberculosis was considered, along with other potential infections, including urethral infections, infective endocarditis, brain abscess, and lung infection. Dental disease was also identified as a potential contributing factor. Microscopic examination revealed inflammatory cells, further supporting the presence of an infection. The patient was also diagnosed with Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.
