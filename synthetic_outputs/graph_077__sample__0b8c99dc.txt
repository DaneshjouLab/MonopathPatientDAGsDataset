A 66-year-old man presented with cough, sputum, chest tightness and pain persisting for 1 month. The patient received cefaclor and azithromycin at a local clinic with no tangible alleviation. Chest X-ray revealed a space-occupying mass in the left lung. The patient was hospitalised on 10 September 2023. After hospitalization, laboratory investigations were normal. CT imaging demonstrated irregularly shaped soft tissue masses in both the upper and lower lobes of the left lung, characterised by irregular margins, lobulation, spiculation and pleural indentation. The masses exhibited inhomogeneous enhancement. Initial pulmonary CT images showed an irregular soft tissue mass measuring approximately 4.7 cm × 3.8 cm in the upper lobe of the left lung, with lobulated and spiculated margins and partial bronchioles truncated near the hilum. An oval mass was found in the lower lobe of the lung, measuring about 2.3 × 1.7 cm, with lobulated, spiculated margins and pleural retraction signs. PET-CT showed high-density lesions in both the upper and lower lobes of the left lung, with increased glucose metabolism (SUV values of 8.8 and 7.4, respectively). Multiple enlarged lymph nodes were detected in the mediastinum and interlobular spaces. Pathogenic bacteria culture, Gene-Xpert detection and metagenomic next-generation sequencing of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung tissue were all negative.
