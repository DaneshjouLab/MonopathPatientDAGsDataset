A 72-year-old woman with a history of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) presented with progressive involuntary writhing movements in her hands and lower extremities over the past 3 months. Workup included a brain MRI and CT, which showed no hemorrhage or lesions on the red nucleus or midbrain, and the previous right prefrontal lesion had resolved after radiosurgery. Electroencephalogram ruled out seizure activity, and electrolyte levels were normal. Ceruloplasmin test was negative. Serum paraneoplastic panel was positive for anti-Hu antibodies at a titer of 1:960 (normal reference <1:240). The patient's symptoms worsened despite treatment with diazepam, primidone, and pramipexole, resulting in hospitalization. The patient was given intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) for 4 days and was discharged with improved choreiform movements. One week later, the patient presented to the emergency department with nausea and vomiting without new abnormal movements or neurologic symptoms. Repeat MRI revealed a 3.3 x 2.3 cm mass in the left cerebellar region, involving the left cerebellar peduncle. The mass exerted the greatest mass effect at the junction of the pons and medulla and extended into the foramen of Luschka on both sides. The patient reported no loss of consciousness during these episodes but described significant discomfort and disrupted sleep due to the frequency of the movements. Treatment history included chemotherapy, immunotherapy with atezolizumab, and stereotactic brain radiation for a prior metastatic lesion. Laboratory evaluation revealed positive anti-Hu antibodies.
