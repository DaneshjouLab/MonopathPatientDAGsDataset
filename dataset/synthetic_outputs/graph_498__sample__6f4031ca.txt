A 34-year-old male with Bloom Syndrome (BS) presented for care. His diagnosis of BS was delayed due to living in refugee camps in Honduras. In 1990, the patient and his family came to Canada as refugees. At age 13, he presented to the hospital with short stature. His mother reported that he stopped growing at age 10. Examination revealed facial erythema, microcephaly, and delayed mental development. The patient was evaluated by medical genetics. A skin biopsy from his left arm was taken for cytogenetics; 103 cells examined showed three cell lines. Cultured fibroblasts by fluorescent banding showed a male.

Later, the patient with Bloom Syndrome (BS) was involved in a motor vehicle accident as a pedestrian.

In January 2011, the patient presented to a trauma follow-up clinic and discovered a new mass on the left side of his neck. Physical examination revealed a mobile, 2-3 cm lymph node in the left posterior cervical chain that was tender to palpation. In January 2011, a fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the left posterior cervical chain lymph node was suggestive of a reactive process (i.e., numerous and variable lymphocytes, neutrophils, and histiocytes). In February 2011, a Tru-Cut core needle biopsy was taken from the left posterior cervical chain lymph node for flow cytometric testing to confirm the absence of a B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder. The biopsy stained positive for CD20, suggestive of B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder, but there was no definitive evidence of clonality based on kappa lambda staining. Staging investigations were initiated, including a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. A bone marrow aspirate biopsy and cytogenetics were ordered to look for more conclusive evidence of a B-cell malignancy. Bone marrow aspirate, flow cytometry, and cytology were normal.
