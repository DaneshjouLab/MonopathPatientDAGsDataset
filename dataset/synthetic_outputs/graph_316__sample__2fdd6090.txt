A 72-year-old female with no significant medical history was referred for evaluation of a suspected malignant right-sided pleural effusion. Chest CT showed circumferential nodular right-sided pleural thickening with associated pleural effusion and a 2-cm nodule in the right lower lobe. Thoracic ultrasound (TUS) showed a simple effusion, and 500 mL of dark brown fluid (degraded haemoglobin) was aspirated. Three days after the initial aspiration, the patient re-presented with chest pain. Chest X-ray (CXR) and CT scan showed reaccumulation of the pleural effusion. Thoracic ultrasound (TUS) showed the effusion was heavily septated. A 12-Fr ICD was inserted into the septated collection under ultrasound guidance, draining minimal dark sanguineous fluid with a pleural fluid/serum haematocrit ratio of 0.58, suggestive of interval pleural haemorrhage. A single dose of intrapleural alteplase 10 mg was given 30 min after ICD insertion, resulting in a further 1400 mL of drain output. Repeat CXR showed a significant reduction in the volume of effusion and revealed underlying trapped lung. Fluid cytology was positive for lung adenocarcinoma, and haemoglobin remained stable.
