A 58-year-old male presented in July 2016 with a 5-month history of recurrent cough and sputum production, accompanied by hemoptysis for 2 months. A chest CT scan revealed an irregular, lobulated soft tissue mass in the left lower lobe, closely adhering to the descending aorta and right inferior pulmonary vein. Multiple enlarged lymph nodes were observed in the left hilum and mediastinum.

Initially, the patient was considered to have lumbar disc herniation and received symptomatic pain relief, but the symptoms did not improve. Subsequently, the patient developed periumbilical distending pain. An enhanced abdominal CT scan revealed acute pancreatitis, multiple low-density nodules in the liver (nature undetermined), a left adrenal gland nodule (highly suggestive of metastasis), and local bone destruction in the left ilium, acetabulum, left side of the pubic symphysis, and left pubic branch (suggestive of metastasis).

Further investigation with a chest CT scan showed a mass in the right upper lobe, multiple mildly enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum, and bilateral pleural effusions. A head MRI revealed abnormal enhancing lesions in the left frontal and parietal cortex (suggestive of metastasis) and an abnormal enhancing lesion in the right frontal lobe (metastasis not ruled out). A bone scan showed abnormal tracer accumulation in the left hip, proximal femur, and right scapula, suggestive of metastasis.

A percutaneous lung biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), favoring adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemical staining showed the cancer cells were positive for CK7, NaspsinA, TTF-1, and CK9, and negative for CK20.

One month later, imaging revealed an increase in the size of the right upper lobe mass and the left adrenal gland mass, along with the development of new cerebellar metastases. The patient was assessed as having progressive disease (PD).
