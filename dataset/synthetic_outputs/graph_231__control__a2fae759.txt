A patient presented with dyspnea and shortness of breath. Initial investigations, including bronchoscopy, revealed adenosquamous bronchial carcinoma. The patient underwent pneumonectomy as treatment for the bronchial carcinoma. Post-operatively, the patient experienced desaturation and hypoxemia. Further investigation revealed platypnea-orthodeoxia syndrome, likely related to a patent foramen ovale or atrial septal defect. Lung perfusion scintigraphy was performed. Transthoracic echocardiography confirmed the presence of a patent foramen ovale. The patient also experienced orthostatic hypotension and gentle shortness of breath. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing was conducted. The patient was found to have femur metastasis and received radiotherapy and immunotherapy. The patient also had liver cirrosis and bronchial stenosis, potentially contributing to atelectasis and hypoxic vasoconstriction. The patient's oxygen saturation was monitored. Lymph nodes were also evaluated.
