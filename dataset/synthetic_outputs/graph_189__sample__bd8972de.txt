In June 2023, a 59-year-old female patient was admitted to the hospital due to an allergic reaction to aminopyrine. During the workup, a chest CT scan revealed a mass-like soft tissue density shadow (51 mm x 34 mm) in the posterior basal segment of the right lower lobe, suggestive of lung cancer. Small branches of the pulmonary artery surrounded the mass, and the adjacent right lower pulmonary vein was compressed. Multiple enlarged lymph nodes were identified in the bilateral supraclavicular fossa, mediastinum (2R, 4R, 5 area, 7 area), and bilateral pulmonary hilum, with the largest in the 4R area (short diameter approximately 10 mm). A slightly enhanced nodule was also noted in the right upper lobe. Subsequent head MRI showed abnormal signals in the right frontotemporal region, raising suspicion for metastasis. A CT-guided percutaneous lung biopsy was performed, and microscopic examination confirmed lung adenocarcinoma with typical papillary and micropapillary structures and invasive growth. The clinical stage was determined to be cT4N3M1b IVA. In July 2023, DNA/RNA-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) of lung adenocarcinoma tissue sections revealed an EGFR G719A mutation (exon 18 c.2156G>C, mutation abundance 33.92%) and an LMNA-NTRK1 fusion mutation [LMNA(chr1:156100564)-NTRK1(chr1:156844698) L2N11]. FISH validation confirmed the NTRK fusion positivity with an NTRK break-apart probe showing separation signals. Based on the NGS results revealing the EGFR G719A mutation, the patient was started on oral targeted therapy with Afatinib (30 mg once daily) in July 2023. One month later, follow-up was scheduled.
