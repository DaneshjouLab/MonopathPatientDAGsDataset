We present the clinical case of a 58-year-old female patient, a smoker with a 15-pack-year history and 15 years of occupational exposure to respiratory toxins from working in the tobacco industry. She also had multiple comorbidities, including grand mal epilepsy, stage II hypertension, hypertensive heart disease with preserved ejection fraction, grade I obesity, a hysterectomy in 2001 for uteroplacental apoplexy, and surgically induced menopause at age 34.

The patient was admitted to our clinic following evaluation in an emergency department, where she was diagnosed with a moderate right pleural effusion. Upon admission, the patient exhibited respiratory symptoms, including progressive dyspnea with a moderate exertion threshold, right posterior pleuritic chest pain radiating anteriorly, occasional episodes of low-grade fever, and persistent febrile symptoms lasting approximately two weeks.

In this clinical context, the diagnostic process was guided by the presence of right pleural effusion syndrome, which was refractory to conservative medical therapy. This necessitated a careful and stepwise expansion of investigations, ultimately leading to the diagnosis of malignant pleural mesothelioma.

This case underscores the diagnostic challenges posed by pleural effusion, the necessity of adhering to the diagnostic algorithm, and the critical role of the multidisciplinary team. MPM is notoriously challenging to diagnose early, as initial symptoms like chest pain, dyspnea, and pleural effusions are often nonspecific and mimic other pulmonary conditions.

Standard therapies include surgery, such as pleurectomy/decortication or extrapleural pneumonectomy, combined with chemotherapy (often pemetrexed and cisplatin) and radiation therapy.
