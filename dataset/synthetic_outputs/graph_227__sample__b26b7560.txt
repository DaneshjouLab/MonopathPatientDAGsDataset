In August 2021, a patient was diagnosed with stage IVB (cT4N3M1c) left lower lobe adenocarcinoma. Imaging revealed metastases in bilateral lungs, left hilar lymph nodes, mediastinal lymph nodes, bilateral supraclavicular lymph nodes, and bone. The patient's ECOG PS score was 1. A lung biopsy confirmed the ADC origin of the lung cancer, showing poorly differentiated tumor tissue. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) results were: ALK+, CK+, CK5/6+, TTF-1+, NapsinA+, Ki-67+, P40-, CD56-, Syn-, NUT-.

The patient received first-line treatment with alectinib 600 mg twice a day orally and achieved a partial response. Due to chest pain and aggravated bone destruction of the 8th thoracic vertebra, the patient underwent palliative local radiotherapy targeting the lesion of the 7th to 9th thoracic vertebrae, with a tissue dose of 30 Gy/10 fractions/14 days.

Approximately 4.5 months after radiotherapy, CT scans indicated disease progression with enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes and new metastases in the 10th thoracic vertebra and the right occipital lobe. A CT-guided mediastinal lymph node biopsy was performed. Histopathological evaluation indicated ADC based on IHC staining of ALK (+), CK7 (weakly +), CK20 (\u2212), Villin (weak +), P40 (\u2212), Ki-67 (approximately 20% +), TTF-1 (\u2212), NapsinA (\u2212), and CK (+).

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) revealed ALK-RNF144A fusion (AF 36.05%), HIP1-ALK fusion (AF: 27.16%), and an RB1 splice variant in exon 14 (AF: 26.1%). The tumor mutational burden (TMB) was 1.0 mutations/Mb, with microsatellite stable (MSS) status. IHC of PD-L1 showed expression <1%.

In December 2021, after 4.5 months of alectinib treatment, CT scan and brain MRI were performed. HE staining of the biopsy specimen showed a poorly differentiated tumor tissue. IHC experiments showed positive expressions of ALK, CK7, Villin, Ki-67, CK, and negative expression of CK20, P40, TTF-1, and NapsinA (\u00d7100). NGS confirmed the coexistence of ALK-RNF144A and HIP1-ALK fusions in this female patient with lung adenocarcinoma.
