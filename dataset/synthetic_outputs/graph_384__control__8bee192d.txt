A patient underwent a procedure considered safe and effective, but with potential complications. These complications include pneumothorax (17%–27%), hemorrhage (4%–27%), hemoptysis (11%), air embolism (0.061%), and tumor seeding (0.012%–0.061%).

Immediately after a percutaneous transthoracic needle biopsy (PTNB), CT images revealed a 3-mm-sized, air-filled cystic lesion in the path of the biopsy needle, suggesting a pneumatocele. The image showed extension along the adjacent bronchovascular bundle. In addition, accompanied ground-glass opacity and consolidation due to hemorrhage and ipsilateral pneumothorax were observed. Further analysis indicated that the fluid content of the cavities was hemorrhage, originating from surrounding alveolar capillaries or pulmonary vessels.
