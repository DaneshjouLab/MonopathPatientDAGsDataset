A 37-year-old female patient reported intermittent cough and slight chest discomfort for 3 months and a painless cervical mass for 1 month. Due to these symptoms, the patient underwent a left cervical lymph node puncture one week prior to presentation. Pathology showed granulomatous inflammation, with caseous necrosis and Langhans’ giant cells observed. The patient has a past medical history of untreated congenital heart disease (patent ductus arteriosus) for 20 years and hypertension for half a year, with irregular use of valsartan. Physical examination revealed a 4x3 cm, well-defined, poorly mobile, non-tender mass on the left clavicle without surface ulceration or redness. The lungs were unremarkable. Auscultation revealed a continuous murmur at the left sternal border. Laboratory tests showed normal blood CEA, squamous cell carcinoma antigen, cytokeratin 19 fragment, and NSE levels. Blood routine test, liver and kidney function, electrolytes, PCT, CRP, and T-lymphocyte subsets were all normal. Sputum AFB and GeneXpert MTB/RIF were negative. EB virus blood test showed increased antibody title of capsid antigen IgG antibody 750U/mL (Reference:0–20 U/mL), EB virus early antigen IgM antibody 2.57 COI (Cut off index reference:0-1.1) and EB virus core antigen IgG antibody 600U/mL(Reference:0–20 U/mL). Ultrasound-guided left supraclavicular lymph node puncture was performed. Histopathology showed focal distribution of epithelioid cells and a few multinucleated giant cells, which suggested granulomatous inflammation. Acid-fast and methenamine silver staining were negative. Lymph node tissue GeneXpert MTB/RIF and TB culture were negative. Biopsy demonstrated granuloma.
