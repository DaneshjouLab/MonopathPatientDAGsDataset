A 74-year-old male with a nodule in the left upper lobe was referred for CT-guided percutaneous needle biopsy (PTNB). The CT-guided PTNB was performed using a coaxial biopsy system with a 19-gauge introducer needle and a 20-gauge core biopsy needle (length, 16 cm; Bard Maxcore, Bard Peripheral Vascular Inc., Tempe, AZ, USA). CT scan parameters were: Aquilion PRIME; Canon Medical Systems, Otawara, Japan; 2-mm slice thickness and no interval.

The patient was placed in a supine oblique position. A CT scan of the thorax showed a 22 mm lobulated nodule in the left upper lobe apicoposterior segment. Biopsy was performed following local anesthesia with 2% lidocaine. A 19-gauge introducer needle was inserted and advanced along the planned trajectory. A CT scan was acquired to confirm needle tip location. The inner stylet was removed and replaced by the biopsy needle, which was advanced into the lesion. A sample was acquired, the biopsy needle was removed, and replaced by the stylet. Samples were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. The introducer needle was removed rapidly. The needle tip was located outside the tumor, and specimen acquisition was performed once.

An immediate post-biopsy CT scan of the thorax revealed a 3-mm air-filled cystic lesion in the path of the biopsy needle, suggesting a pneumatocele with extension along the adjacent bronchovascular bundle. Immediate post-PTNB CT images showed a 3-mm-sized, air-filled cystic lesion in the path of the biopsy needle, suggesting a pneumatocele, with extension along the adjacent bronchovascular bundle, accompanied by ground-glass opacity and consolidation due to hemorrhage and minimal ipsilateral pneumothorax. Histological examination of the PTNB revealed pulmonary adenocarcinoma.

Ten days after sampling, the patient underwent chest CT with enhancement for preoperative staging of lung cancer. The CT image obtained 10 days after PTNB showed a well-defined, tubular-shaped, non-enhancing nodule with heterogeneous attenuation in the area where pneumatoceles had been previously observed.

An 18FDG PET/CT obtained 14 days after PTNB showed no hypermetabolism in the nodule, whereas the adjacent tumor showed hypermetabolism (SUVmax, 6.0). The nodules were considered as pneumatoceles filled with hematoma rather than tumor seeding. The patient had no fever, respiratory symptoms, or hemoptysis.

A chest CT before biopsy showed a 24 mm microlobulated contoured nodule with pseudocavitation in the anterior segment of the left upper lobe. The needle tip was located outside the tumor, and specimen acquisition was performed four times.

A left upper lobectomy was performed for primary lung cancer. The specimen revealed no other specific lesions except lung cancer.

The patient was discharged after 1 month with no other symptoms.
