Pulmonary enteric adenocarcinoma with progression disease after second - line therapy: a case report

A 61-year-old male with a 30-year smoking history of 20 cigarettes per day presented in July 2023 with left abdominal pain of one month's duration, for which he had received no prior treatment. He had no family history of genetic diseases, alcohol consumption, or psychiatric disorders.

In August 2023, a positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scan revealed soft tissue lesions in the left upper lobe of the lung with increased FDG metabolism, suggestive of lung cancer. Enlargement of the left hilar lymph node was also noted. Soft tissue density shadows in both adrenal glands and the left kidney posteromedial region were considered metastases. A computed tomography (CT)-guided biopsy of the left lung lesion was performed. Pathological results indicated adenocarcinoma, but pulmonary marker expression was poor. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed: TTF-1 (-), CK7 (+), Napsin A (-), CEA (+), CK5/6 (+), Syn (-), P63 (-), Ki-67+ (50%). Genetic testing revealed a KRAS mutation abundance of 31.22%, with no EGFR, AKL, ROS-1, MET, or HER-2 mutations detected. PD-L1 expression status was unknown. Given the presence of multiple metastases at presentation, the patient was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer, precluding radical surgery.

The patient received two cycles of first-line treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) plus platinum-based chemotherapy, specifically Tislelizumab 200mg d1 + pemetrexed 500mg/m2 d1 + cisplatin 75mg/m2 d2, every 3 weeks, initiated on August 19, 2023, and September 10, 2023, respectively. However, disease progression occurred after these two cycles, resulting in a progression-free survival (PFS) of 1.5 months.

On October 15, 2023, the patient presented to the Oncology Department of Jining First Peopleâ€™s Hospital due to worsening left abdominal pain for one week. The pain was affecting sleep and activity, necessitating oxycodone sustained-release tablet 10mg every 12 hours for pain relief. On October 16, 2023, serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level was > 979.0ng/ml (reference range 0-5).

The second-line treatment was adjusted to the XELOX regimen (oxaliplatin combined with capecitabine). After 2 and 4 cycles, the lesions were significantly reduced. However, the disease progressed again after 6 cycles, with a PFS of 4.5 months. Anlotinib targeted drugs were considered for third-line treatment, but given the patient's overall poor condition, he refused further treatment. Following discharge, the patient sought nutritional support and symptomatic treatment at a local hospital.

The results suggest that standard first-line therapies (immunotherapy plus chemotherapy) and colorectal cancer regimens may have a relatively limited impact on survival in KRAS-driver positive advanced pulmonary enteric adenocarcinoma.
