A patient presented with symptoms including coughing, shortness of breath, reduced fetal movement, and cyanosis. The patient was diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer, which had metastasized to the bone. Specifically, multiple vertebral bone destruction was noted, indicating bone metastasis. The patient also developed severe pneumonia, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute respiratory failure, resulting in severe hypoxemia. Further investigation revealed several opportunistic infections, including pneumocystis pneumonia (caused by *Pneumocystis jiroveci*), pulmonary tuberculosis (tuberculosis infection), *Klebsiella pneumoniae* infection, *Cryptococcus neoformans* infection, and *Elizabethkingia spp* infection. Malignant tumor cells were identified, confirming the diagnosis of non-small cell carcinoma. The patient received both anti-tumor therapy to target the lung cancer and bone metastasis, and anti-infective therapy to combat the multiple infections. The patient experienced severe hypoxemia and severe pneumonia, leading to ARDS. The patient was diagnosed with tuberculosis. The patient was diagnosed with lung tumor with bone metastasis.
