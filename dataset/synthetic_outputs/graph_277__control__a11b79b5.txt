A 62-year-old female with lung adenocarcinoma, post-treatment with ipilimumab and nivolumab, developed life-threatening grade 4 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) two weeks after her last immunotherapy session. Advances in immunotherapy, particularly checkpoint inhibitors (CPI), have improved outcomes in various cancers, but also increased the incidence of immune-related adverse events such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS). CRS is a hyperactivation of the immune system commonly seen in CAR-T cell therapy but can also occur with PD-1 and CTLA-4 inhibitors. Severe forms are characterized by fulminant systemic inflammation, often requiring intensive care and multifaceted treatment.

On 19 October 2023 at 12:50 (14 days after the last ipilimumab plus nivolumab application) she presented in an infectious disease emergency department with symptoms of malaise, fatigue, nausea, vomiting and fever. She denied pain, dyspnea, urinary and gastrointestinal abnormalities. She informed that she had symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection with nasal congestion and a sore throat one week prior, which had completely resolved. Clinical examinations showed hypotension.

She presented with symptoms mimicking septic shock (malaise, fever and hypotension), leading to an initial misdiagnosis of sepsis. Initial treatment of presumed septic shock of unknown origin did not yield results. She was treated with fluids, antibiotics and corticosteroids.

The clinical deterioration, high IL-6 levels and lack of infectious source led to the diagnosis of grade 4 CRS. Elevated IL-6 (10,8878 pg/ml) was a critical diagnostic marker. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is immune dysregulation phenomenon that is associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. It is still difficult to distinguish CRS from other dangerous, acute and life-threatening medical disorders.

The case highlights the importance of considering CRS in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, especially when presenting with severe symptoms. Elevated IL-6 is a key biomarker for CRS, and distinguishing CRS from sepsis is critical for appropriate treatment. For patients on immune checkpoint inhibitors presenting with acute severe illness, comprehensive testing including IL-6 is recommended. Hemadsorption therapy may be a viable rescue option in severe cases of CRS.
