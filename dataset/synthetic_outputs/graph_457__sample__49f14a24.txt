A 64-year-old male presented with epigastric pain and progressive dysphagia for more than one month. He had a smoking history of 1.5 packs/day for 17 years. One year prior to this presentation, he was diagnosed with primary lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the right lower lobe (Fig.1a), and had undergone thoracoscopic lower lobectomy. The cancer was staged as pT2aN0M0, stage IB according to the eighth edition of the UICC classification. He then underwent adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of four cycles of uracil and tegafur.

Following the onset of epigastric pain and dysphagia, a chest CT scan showed a 3.2 x 2.3 cm right lower lobe nodule. An abdominal CT scan showed a 5.2 x 5.0 cm gastric fundal mass located in the gastric cardia. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed a 5 cm subepithelial and ulcerated mass located in the gastric cardia (Fig.1c). Gastric biopsies identified SCC. A CT scan revealed remarkable growth of the tumor without any additional organ metastasis.

One month after the diagnosis of gastric SCC, the patient underwent proximal gastrectomy with resection of the diaphragmatic crus, which was reconstructed by esophagogastrostomy. Gross examination of the gastric lesion revealed a 7.0 x 7.0 cm hard mass with ulceration, directly invading the esophagus and diaphragm. Postoperative histopathology revealed keratinizing SCC with massive submucosal infiltration and major vascular invasion. Zero of 17 lymph nodes showed signs of malignancy. The histopathological report concluded that the tumor was a metastasis from the primary lung SCC.

The patient was discharged without complications 14 days after gastrectomy. Two months after surgery, follow\u2010
