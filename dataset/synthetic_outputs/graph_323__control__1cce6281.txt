A patient with a history of intestinal obstruction requiring abdominal surgery at age 13, with recurrences around 2003 and 2006, was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma via bronchoscopic biopsy. The patient was found to have multiple metastases in the lung, liver, pericardium, bone, brain, and distant lymph nodes. Four months after the first use of pembrolizumab, the patient experienced abdominal pain caused by right ureterectasia. One month later, the patient experienced recurrent abdominal pain. Laboratory testing revealed elevated serum amylase (132 U/L, normal: 35–115 U/L) and lipase (746 U/L, normal: 2–53 U/L). Contrast-enhanced CT revealed exudation around the pancreas, slight dilatation of the pancreatic duct, a thickened peritoneum, and cloudy mesentery, findings often encountered in abdominal inflammatory reactions such as acute pancreatitis or lupus. The CT scan also revealed a thickened left ureter with avid enhancement accompanied by ureterectasia.
