A 53-year-old man underwent right-sided extrapleural pneumonectomy for malignant pleural mesothelioma. He underwent right-sided pericardial resection and reconstruction with an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) sheet. Routine chest radiography performed 18 hours postoperatively revealed cardiac herniation into the right-sided thoracic cavity. The patient was immediately transferred to the operating room and underwent emergency thoracotomy. Cardiac herniation had occurred secondary to tearing of sutures on the posterior aspect of the ePTFE sheet. The heart was placed back within the pericardium, and the tears were repaired by fixing another ePTFE sheet to close the defect between the posterior pericardium and the previously placed ePTFE sheet using horizontal mattress and continuous sutures. The postoperative course was uneventful, and he was discharged 43 days after the second operation. He died of tumor progression 2 years after the second operation. However, cardiac herniation did not recur postoperatively. Cardiac herniation is a rare and fatal complication because it precipitates acute cardiac failure and injury to the heart or vessels.
