A Stage IIB (T2N1M0) adenosquamous carcinoma was diagnosed histopathologically. The pathological result of lung biopsy remains as an adenosquamous carcinoma. PET/CT showed progressive disease (PD) with an extensive hypermetabolic mass in bilateral lung, extensive hypermetabolic mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, and bone destruction in the T8, T12 vertebral bone metastasis. Tode et al reported a germline *MET* p.Asn375Lys (c.1125C>G) in four affected siblings with *EGFR*-mutant lung cancer. Recent studies have concluded that a subset of *EGFR* mutant NSCLC would transform to small cell lung cancer (SCLC) acting as one of the resistance mechanisms to EGFR TKI. Concurrent *RB1* and *TP53* inactivating mutations is a molecular characteristic of SCLC and concurrent *EGFR/TP53/RB1* triple mutant lung cancers are at unique risk of histologic transformation.
