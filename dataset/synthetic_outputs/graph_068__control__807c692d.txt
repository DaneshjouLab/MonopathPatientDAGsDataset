A patient presented with lung cancer, a malignant tumor. Initial symptoms included fatigue, fever, and weight loss. The patient underwent surgical treatment followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Despite these interventions, the patient experienced a recurrence of the lung cancer, manifesting as both local recurrence and distant metastasis. Immunotherapy was subsequently administered. The patient also received Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), including traditional Chinese medicine decoctions, as part of their treatment regimen. Surgical treatment was repeated, and further chemotherapy cycles were administered. The patient's treatment also included immunosuppressors. The patient's condition continued to be monitored, with ongoing management of the lung tumors and invasive adenocarcinoma. The patient ultimately succumbed to cancer deaths.
