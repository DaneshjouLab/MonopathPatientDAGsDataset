A 32-year-old female presented with a 5-month history of recurrent dry cough, occurring approximately 30 times a day and lasting 2-3 minutes each time. She had been treated at a local hospital without imaging. One week prior to admission on April 14, 2022, the patient underwent a lower segment caesarean section under epidural anesthesia at a local hospital due to hypoxemia and reduced fetal movement at 37 weeks gestation. She was admitted to the hospital on April 14, 2022, due to the persistent cough, shortness of breath for one week, and worsening symptoms for one day after delivery.

The patient was transferred to the hospital for hypoxemia. Physical examination revealed a temperature of 36.6 \u2103, heart rate of 110 / min, respiratory rate of 35 / min, blood pressure of 132 / 92mmHg, and pulse oxygen saturation of 81% while receiving 100% oxygen via endotracheal intubation with ventilator assistance. The patient was conscious and exhibited cyanosis on her lips and nails. Respiratory sounds were reduced in both lower lungs, and scattered wet rales were heard throughout both lungs.

On April 14, 2022, a chest CT at the local hospital showed multiple exudative lesions in both lungs, multiple areas of bone destruction in the thoracic vertebrae, and pathological fractures of the 7th rib on the right and the 2nd and 6th ribs on the left.

A reexamination of the chest CT on May 2, 2022, showed multiple patchy high-density shadows in both lungs with blurred margins.
