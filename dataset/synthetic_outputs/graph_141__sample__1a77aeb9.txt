A 57-year-old Guatemalan female presented to the emergency department with a 3-month history of persistent cough and globus sensation, initially treated with Symbicort without improvement. She also reported fatigue, dyspnea on exertion, and unintentional weight loss over two weeks. She denied fevers, chills, nausea, hemoptysis, night sweats, joint/bone pain, and other constitutional symptoms.

Patient history included a father with lung cancer at age 60, no tobacco use, and employment as a childcare worker, housecleaner (7 years), and factory worker constructing metal cabinets (7 years).

Upon presentation, the patient was afebrile, tachycardic, and hypertensive, with an SpO2 of 98% on room air.

Physical examination revealed right-sided inspiratory crackles and decreased breath sounds throughout the right lung. Procalcitonin was 0.22, platelets were 456, and all other labs were within normal limits.

Chest X-ray (CXR) showed a right-sided pleural effusion, near complete collapse of the ipsilateral lung, and a cavitary lesion in the right mid-lung (7.1 cm).

A contrast CT scan showed a right-sided pleural effusion, irregular pleural thickening (>7mm), a large centrally necrotized right paratracheal node (2.1 cm), and calcified pleural plaques of the left lung.

CT Chest with contrast axial view showed irregular pleural thickening and pleural effusion. Blood cultures, AFB, and staining were performed.

The patient was placed in TB isolation and received empirical RIPE therapy (rifampin (RIF), isoniazid (INH), pyrazinamide (PZA), and ethambutol (EMB)) until TB was ruled out.

The patient underwent video-assisted thoracotomy surgery with pleural exudate evacuation, pleural resection, decortication, and multilevel intercostal nerve block.

Pathology report from right pleural frozen sections and pleural exudate showed findings consistent with advanced-stage mesothelioma positive for calretinin, podoplanin (D2-40), and CK5/6. Stain Results: Calretinin Highlights tumor cells, CK 5/6 Highlights tumor cells, D2-40 Highlights tumor cells and vessels, CK7 Highlights tumor cells, WT1 Highlights tumor cells and vessels, CK7 Negative, CK19 Highlights tumor cells, CD3 Highlights reactive T cells, CD20 Highlights reactive T cells, P40 Negative, P63 Negative, TTF-1 Negative, CK20 Negative, CD34 Highlights vessels and nonspecific stromal staining, CD68 Highlights histiocytes, CDX2 Negative, CEA(M) Negative.

The patient was discharged home with outpatient chemotherapy arrangements.

The patient passed away a month later due to disease progression and associated complications.
