A 64-year-old nonsmoking woman with lung adenocarcinoma presented to the hospital on April 26, 2019, for further treatment. She had a history of stage IIIA lung adenocarcinoma diagnosed on September 10, 2014, after presenting with sudden glossolalia and right lower limb numbness. On September 24, 2014, she underwent resection of the upper lobe. Following surgery, she received four cycles of chemotherapy with pemetrexed combined with carboplatin. In November 2015, the disease progressed, and she was treated with paclitaxel plus cisplatin combined with bevacizumab for six cycles from November 11, 2015, to March 11, 2016. From April 1, 2016, to April 26, 2019, she received pemetrexed combined with bevacizumab, during which time her condition remained stable. After the last cycle of treatment with pemetrexed plus bevacizumab, chest CT showed bone metastases in the thoracolumbar spine and bilateral local ribs, nodules in both lungs, and pericardial and left pleural effusion. The patient presented to the hospital because she could not tolerate the side effects of previous chemotherapy, including myelosuppression, cardiac insufficiency, and renal insufficiency.
