A 73-year-old male with a history of extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), diagnosed 15 months prior, presented to the emergency department with dyspnea, abdominal distension, and lower-extremity edema due to severe IVC stenosis. The patient had received 6 cycles of carboplatin/etoposide chemotherapy, followed by thoracic radiotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation. He had also experienced a 20 kg weight loss within the past 12 months.

Upon presentation, the patient's ECOG performance status was 4. Vital signs were: BP 100/70 mmHg, HR 90 bpm, SpO2 89%, and Temp 36.9°C. Laboratory results included: Hemoglobin 12.6 g/dL, platelets 260 x 10^3/μL, alkaline phosphatase 94 U/L, ALT 40 U/L, AST 34 U/L, total bilirubin 0.88 mg/dL, and INR 1.3. A CT scan of the chest and abdomen revealed a heterogeneously enhancing mass in the right lower and middle lung (17.6 cm), mostly solid with large necrotic areas, multiple enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, infiltration of the visceral pleura and right hemidiaphragm, ascites, and peritoneal metastases. Significant compression and stenosis of the suprahepatic segment of the IVC prior to insertion into the right atrium (RA) was also noted. The large tumor involving the right lower and middle lung lobe measured (17.6 x 19.3 x 18.6) mm (maximal axial x coronal x sagittal dimension), which caused significant compression of the IVC.

Due to the IVC stenosis, an endovascular intervention was planned, and written informed consent was obtained. A 5F sheath was inserted into the right basilic vein and a 10F sheath into the right common femoral vein under local anesthesia. Venography showed significant compression of the suprahepatic IVC.

The IVC stenosis was passed using a 0.035-inch hydrophilic guidewire and a multipurpose catheter. Mechanical thrombectomy was performed, but no thrombotic material was extracted. A stiffer exchange guidewire was placed with its distal tip positioned in the right subclavian vein. Three uncovered self-expanding nitinol sinus-XL stents (OptiMed, Ettlingen, Germany) were deployed in tandem from the SVC to the IVC with overlap. Stent sizes were: 18 × 80 mm, 18 × 60 mm, and 16 × 80 mm, placed in a cephalic-to-caudal orientation.

Final venography revealed adequate flow through the vena cava and bridging stents. Digital venography illustrated significant stenosis of the suprahepatic inferior vena cava (IVC) due to compression. Low-molecular-weight heparin was administered.

Following the intervention, the patient's IVCS symptoms, mainly trunk and lower limb edema, were significantly alleviated within 48 hours. However, the patient died 8 days later from his primary disease (SCLC).
