A patient developed neutropenic colitis, followed by ESBL Escherichia coli septicemia. This led to acute kidney injury (AKI) and multi-organ failure. Further investigation revealed nephrotic range proteinuria. A renal biopsy showed acute and chronic tubulo-interstitial nephritis (TIN), amyloidosis, and global glomerulosclerosis. The final diagnosis was secondary renal AA amyloidosis and tubulointerstitial nephritis. The patient's clinical course was complicated by these conditions, ultimately leading to multi-organ failure.
