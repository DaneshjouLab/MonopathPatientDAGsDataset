A 79-year-old male, height 174 cm, weight 65 kg, BMI 21.5 kg/m², with a smoking history of two packs per day for 55 years (Brinkman Index 1100) and a history of total thyroidectomy five years prior for papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), presented with a complex medical history. Comorbidities included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and hypertension.

Six years prior to the current encounter, the patient was found to have left cervical lymphadenopathy of unknown origin, suspected to be cervical lymph node metastasis of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC).

Five years prior, the patient underwent total thyroidectomy and left cervical lymph node dissection. Histopathology revealed multiple papillary thyroid microcarcinomas (pT1a [m], pEx0, pN1b 4/10, pStage IVA) with negative surgical margins.

Following surgery, the patient was treated with radioiodine therapy (Iodine-131).

Two years prior to the current encounter, a nodule in the right upper lobe of the lung was identified and monitored with chest CT scans. An increase in nodule density was observed compared to two years prior, prompting a transbronchial biopsy; however, no definitive diagnosis was made. Tumor markers (CYFRA, CEA, SLX, ProGRP, NSE) were within normal limits.

Serum thyroglobulin levels showed a gradual increase over time, with a preoperative value of 47.7 ng/mL. Chest X-rays showed no abnormalities, while chest CT scans revealed an irregular nodule measuring 15×14 mm in the S1 segment of the right upper lobe. No hilar lymphadenopathy was detected. Pulmonary function and electrocardiogram tests showed no abnormalities.

A surgical plan was made to perform intraoperative rapid diagnosis, followed by right upper
