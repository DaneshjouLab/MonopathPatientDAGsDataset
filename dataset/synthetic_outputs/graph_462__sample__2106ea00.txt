In 2000, patient V.M., a 51-year-old male, was diagnosed with diffuse bilateral pulmonary fibrosis secondary to systemic sclerosis.

In February 2021, a chest HR CT scan revealed a 27 mm nodule in the lower right lobe, lymphadenopathies in stations 7 (40\u2009\u00d7\u200925 mm), 2R (26\u2009\u00d7\u200927 mm), and 10R (25\u2009\u00d7\u200928 mm), and osteo-structural alterations at right III, IV, and V ribs.

Also in February 2021, an FDG-PET scan confirmed metabolic activity in the nodule in the lower right lobe (SUV max 6.5), III right rib (SUV max 3.5), right sacral wing (SUV max 11.6), lymph node stations 3 (SUV max 7.2) and station 7 (SUV max 8.2).

On March 5th, 2021, the patient underwent EBUS and ultrasound revealed increased lymph node size at 4L, 4R and 7. Smears were collected on stations 4L and 7 and a cryobiopsy on station 7.
