A 33-year-old man with no known comorbidities presented to the hospital with hemoptysis, preceded by chronic cough and intermittent chest pain for 4 years. Seven years prior to presentation, he had been diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis, for which he underwent successful treatment. Physical examination was unremarkable. An urgent computed tomography scan revealed a well-defined lobulated soft tissue density, with internal hypodensity indicating necrosis and coarse calcific specks involving the right hilar region extending up to the subcarinal location. It measured approximately 5.8 cm by 4.7 cm by 4.2 cm (craniocaudal × transverse × anteroposterior) dimension and involved the lung hilum at the level of the third thoracic vertebra. There was considerable compression of the right mainstem bronchus and bronchus intermedius and loss of fat planes with the right pulmonary artery causing splaying of its branches.
