A 64-year-old man with stage IV small cell lung cancer (SCLC) received 3 lines of therapy over 1 year: 1) atezolizumab, carboplatin, and etoposide; 2) topotecan; 3) epirubicin, cyclophosphamide, and vincristine, but experienced progressive disease. Following disease progression after multiple lines of therapy, PET imaging revealed extensive somatostatin receptor (SSTR) positivity of all tumor manifestations: extensive primary tumor with pleural metastases, multiple involved mediastinal lymph nodes and in the upper abdomen, and disseminated bone and brain metastases. Based on PET imaging findings of extensive SSTR positivity, the patient was deemed eligible for SSTR-directed radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT). Patient received 7 cycles of SSTR-directed RPT with a mean intravenous activity of 7.34 GBq per cycle (range, 4.5-9.8 GBq) approximately every 4 weeks. Each cycle was administered after prior treatment with antiemetic and nephroprotective medication. After 2 therapy cycles, the patient presented with a partial response, with a significant reduction of the primary tumor, pleural metastases, and lymph node metastases and only minimal residual metabolic activity in the bone metastases. Following initial partial response after 2 cycles of SSTR-directed RPT, [18F]FDG PET/CT after cycle 4 displayed an overall stable total tumor burden except for 2 new bone lesions in the lower spine. After administration of cycle 4, [18F]FDG PET/CT still displayed an overall stable total tumor burden except for 2 new bone lesions in the lower spine.
