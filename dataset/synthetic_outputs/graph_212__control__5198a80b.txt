A patient with resected stage IIB lung adenosquamous carcinoma (pT3N0M0) underwent adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of four cycles of cisplatin (75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on day 1) and vinorelbine (25 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 1 and 8 every three weeks). The surgical margins were clear, and the resected intrathoracic lymph nodes were free of metastasis. Eight months post-surgery, a repeat CT examination showed a recurrent tumor at the apex of the remaining right lung, measuring 7.0 cm x 6.6 cm x 3.7 cm. The patient underwent surgical resection of the tumor and reconstruction of the chest wall. Histopathological examination of the tumor revealed a high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma with no epithelial elements. The tumor cells were strongly positive for vimentin and negative for cytokeratin (CK) 5 and 6, and thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1). This case suggests that adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy, while extending survival in resected NSCLC, may lead to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in disseminated tumor cells (DTC) or circulating tumor cells (CTC), causing recurrence and metastasis.
