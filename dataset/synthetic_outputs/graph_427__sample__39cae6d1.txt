In July 2019, a patient was admitted to a local hospital complaining of cough and fatigue, with an ECOG performance status of 1. Initial chest CT revealed a left hilar mass with mediastinal lymphadenopathy. An abdominal CT showed a mass in the left adrenal gland, and a spinal MRI demonstrated diffuse abnormal signals in the vertebral body. Further chest CT revealed an irregular mass in the left lower lobe. Cranial enhanced MRI showed no abnormalities. Bronchoscopy and pathology confirmed a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma. The patient was diagnosed with advanced lung adenocarcinoma (stage IVB, cT2N3M1c) with left adrenal metastasis and multiple bone metastases. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of a tissue biopsy was negative for driver gene mutations. The patient was started on first-line therapy consisting of pemetrexed (800mg D1) and cisplatin (40mg D1-3) plus bevacizumab (400mg D1), followed by maintenance therapy of pemetrexed (800mg D1) plus bevacizumab (400mg D1) every 3 weeks. After 2 cycles of first-line therapy, a chest CT showed stable disease. After 6 cycles of first-line therapy, chest CT continued to show stable disease. Subsequent imaging revealed that the primary lesion was larger than before, indicating progressive disease.
