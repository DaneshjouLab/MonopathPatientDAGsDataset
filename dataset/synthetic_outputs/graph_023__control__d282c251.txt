A 47-year-old female patient presented with complaints of decreased vision in her right eye. Her best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 0.7 decimal in the right eye and 1.0 in the left eye. Examination revealed a pigmented choroidal lesion in the parafoveal region with a prominence of 2.9 mm, orange pigment on the surface, and subretinal fluid in its projection. The patient had a history of localized stage IB cutaneous melanoma removed from her back at the age of 36. Yearly follow-up visits at the dermatologist showed no evidence of active disease.

Clinically, the patient was diagnosed with a presumed choroidal metastasis of primary cutaneous melanoma. Upon diagnosis of the choroidal tumor, the patient underwent brachytherapy with a ruthenium-106 plaque in the right eye. Follow-up at the oncologist revealed a widespread disease with metastases in distant lymph nodes, liver, lung, pancreas, and brain. The patient was started on systemic therapy against metastatic cutaneous melanoma.

At 21 months after brachytherapy and 19 months after the initiation of systemic anticancer therapy, the patientâ€™s BCVA in the right eye returned to 1.0 decimal, the choroidal lesion reduced in size, and subretinal fluid receded. Two years after the initial presentation, all metastases were stable or decreased in size.
