A patient presented with lung adenocarcinoma harboring an EGFR L858R mutation. Initial treatment involved cisplatin and pemetrexed. The patient subsequently developed anorexia and hyponatremia. The disease progressed to involve the mediastinal lymph nodes, with adenocarcinoma lesions and subpleural lesions identified. Further investigation revealed areas of squamous cell carcinoma expressing cytokeratin 5/6. The EGFR L858R mutation persisted. Treatment strategies evolved to include osimertinib and ramucirumab. The patient experienced bleeding and oral mucositis. Pneumonitis was also observed. The patient was later treated with pembrolizumab. The patient was then treated with carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel. The patient was then treated with docetaxel and pemetrexed. The patient developed neutropenia and drug-induced lung injury. The patient was then treated with osimertinib. The patient developed cervical lymph node lesions. The patient was diagnosed with EGFR-mutated lung adenocarcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma. The patient was treated with EGFR TKI.
