A 59-year-old immunocompetent Chinese female presented to the respiratory clinic on July 25, 2018, with unilateral pleural effusion and a 2-year history of unexplained pleural effusion and pleural thickening. Her medical history included 20 years of large artery stenosis and seven years of controlled hypertension. She had no history of smoking or alcohol consumption.

The patient denied fever, cough, rash, joint pain, or chronic diarrhea. She reported no history of trauma, travel, or surgery, and no family history of malignancy or connective tissue disease (CTD). Blood, urine, stool tests, as well as biochemical, coagulation, and thyroid function tests were within normal limits. Her CA125 level was elevated at 245.2 U/mL (Normal range: 0.0-22.0 U/mL).

Infections, including tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), were ruled out. CTD was not considered. A CT scan of the chest revealed multiple high-density shadows, enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum, massive pleural effusion in the left thoracic cavity, and small pleural nodular lesions thickening the pleura.

Bronchoscopy and thoracoscopy examinations demonstrated only mild chronic inflammation without any evidence of infection or malignancy. A GI endoscopy was performed.

A second colonoscopy confirmed left-sided pleural effusion associated with rectal diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

Treatment with traditional Chinese medicine led to the resolution of symptoms and pleural effusion.

However, a follow-up chest CT revealed multiple high-density shadows, mediastinal lymph node metastatic nodules, and left pleural effusion, indicating recurrence.

Autofluorescence bronchoscopy showed normal bronchial mucosa and lumen.

Histopathology of the parietal pleura revealed fibrous tissue hyperplasia accompanied by lymphoid and mesodermal tissue hyperplasia.

Histopathology and immunohistochemistry of rectal excision specimens showed CD19 (+), CD20 (+), CD79a (+), CD30 (+), Bcl-2 (partial +), Bcl-6 (+), Îº (partial +), CD10 (+), PAX-5 (+), CD38 (partial +), and Ki-67 (50%+), consistent with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cells.

The patient had recurrent unilateral pleural effusion three times, which resolved spontaneously without treatment. The patient refused FDG-PET/CT due to cost but underwent two colonoscopies, thoracoscopy, and bronchoscopy.

Multiple polypoid appearance in the rectum raised the suspicion of GI lymphoid infiltration.
