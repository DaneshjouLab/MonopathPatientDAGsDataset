A 76-year-old woman was referred to the hospital for a nodule in the right upper lobe. A CT scan of the chest revealed a 2.3 x 1.6 cm nodule in the right upper lobe. She was diagnosed with pulmonary adenocarcinoma (cT1bN0M0, stage IA, according to the TNM classification of the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC), 7th edition; cT1cN0M0, stage 1A3, according to the UICC, 8th edition). The patient had no smoking history and comorbidities of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. In November 2015, she underwent a right upper lobectomy, and the pathological stage was determined to be pT1bN2M0, stage IIIA. Genomic analysis revealed an EGFR gene mutation L858R in exon 21. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) tumor proportion score (TPS) of < 1%. In February 2018, multiple mediastinal and right hilar lymph node metastases were found. Radiation therapy alone was selected. Radiation therapy amounting to a total dose of 60.0 Gy, distributed in 30 fractions, was performed over a period of 6 weeks. A 3D radiotherapy-planning technique was used. 40.0 Gy was distributed in 20 fractions using opposing anterior-posterior fields over the first 4 weeks. An additional 20.0 Gy was distributed in 10 fractions using 10 beams over the subsequent 2 weeks, covering multiple mediastinal lymph node metastases but sparing the spinal cord and hilum of the left lung. The planning target volume included multiple mediastinal and right hilar lymph nodes, with a 10 mm margin.
