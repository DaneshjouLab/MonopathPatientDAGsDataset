Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal tumors of the digestive system, typically occurring in the gastrointestinal tract. This case report describes a rare phenomenon of small cell carcinoma infiltrating a GIST in a patient.

The patient presented to the hospital with chest tightness and shortness of breath for 2 months, along with a dry cough for half a month. Further ancillary tests revealed a lesion in the pelvic cavity. A core needle biopsy (CNB) of the pelvic cavity lesion led to the diagnosis of GIST with small cell carcinoma infiltration.

Currently, the patient is undergoing a chemotherapy regimen consisting of etoposide combined with cisplatin.
