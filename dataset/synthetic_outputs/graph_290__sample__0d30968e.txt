A 50-year-old male presented with lumbago, cough, sputum, and hemoptysis. These initial symptoms led to a biopsy and subsequent diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the left lower lung lobe with cecum metastasis, confirmed by CK5/6 (+) and P63 (+) staining. Further imaging with FDG-PET CT identified an intensely avid left lower lobe mass (Max SUV 10.6, 32 mm x 30 mm) extending to the cecum, top cranial skin, lumbar vertebra, inguinal groin, and left ventricle. Imaging also revealed swelling and inflammation in the nasopharyngeal roof and bilateral walls (2021-02-05). The patient then underwent three cycles of chemotherapy with paclitaxel and DDP on 2021-03-03, 2021-03-26, and 2021-04-19, resulting in a marked reduction in the size of the primary lesion after two cycles. Following chemotherapy, the patient received concurrent radiotherapy for the lumbar spine, inguinal metastatic lymph nodes, and primary lung lesions. After radiotherapy, the patient experienced relief from low back pain and cough symptoms.
