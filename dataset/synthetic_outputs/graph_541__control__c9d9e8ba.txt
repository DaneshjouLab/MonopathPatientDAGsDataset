We present the case of a 53-year-old woman who was diagnosed with early-stage lung cancer by targeted cancer screening consisting of an immunological biopsy-based blood test followed by radiological imaging. In this case, imaging indicated a lung carcinoma in the right upper lobe. A biopsy confirmed the presence of a malignant lung carcinoma, which was removed surgically. The surgical resection and subsequent histologic examination revealed a typical stage I A2 carcinoid without nodes or metastases (I A2 ED 01/21 pT1b (1.2 cm), pN0 (0/38), L0, V0, Pn0, R0 cM0) of the right upper lobe. Histologic examination revealed a typical I A2 carcinoid, which was completely removed, making further therapy obsolete. Anamnesis revealed a hot thyroid nodule, incipient osteoarthritis, cysts in the breast, neurodermatitis, arthritis of the left shoulder, hay fever, and various unspecified allergies. Family history showed that her mother was diagnosed with ovarian cancer at age 75 and her uncle with colorectal cancer at age 67.
