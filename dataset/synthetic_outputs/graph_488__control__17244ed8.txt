A patient with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) presented with leptomeningeal metastasis (LM) manifesting as complete vision loss. In April 2023, the patient experienced a symmetrical decline in vision in both eyes, progressing from blurred vision to complete blindness by May 2023. Funduscopic examination revealed severe bilateral optic disc edema, optic neuropathy, and retinal vascular occlusion associated with high intracranial pressure. In June 2023, a lateral ventricular Ommaya capsule was implanted, and the CSF pressure was measured at 320 mm H2O. Intrathecal chemotherapy (ITC) with pemetrexed (30 mg every 1–2 weeks) was administered through the Ommaya capsule.

In August 2023, the patient's neurological symptoms worsened, including disorientation, confused speech, and hallucinations. CSF analysis revealed a significant number of malignant tumor cells. Genetic testing of the CSF identified CDKN2A nonsense mutation (VAF 66.74%), BRAF G596R mutation (VAF 20.58%), BRAF N581I (VAF 1.83%), BRAF K483E (VAF 1.14%), BRAF G466R (VAF 0.75%), and RET fusion mutation (VAF 0.25%). Cranial MRI did not show clear signs of tumor metastasis. Due to the deteriorating efficacy of ITC with pemetrexed, it was replaced with gemcitabine. The patient's neurological symptoms and headache were significantly relieved, but the visual status remained unchanged. Based on the detection of BRAF gene mutations in the patient’s CSF, targeted therapy with trametinib (a MET inhibitor) was considered.
