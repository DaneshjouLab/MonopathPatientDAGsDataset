A 67-year-old man presented with intractable chylothorax after undergoing a right upper lobectomy and nodal dissection via median sternotomy for lung cancer. Lymphangiography (LAG) with lipiodol and sequential computed tomography revealed the thoracic duct in the left posterior mediastinum and massive lymphatic leakage in the anterior and middle mediastinum. The chylous leakage was resolved by LAG with lipiodol. This case highlights that variation of the thoracic duct should be evaluated by LAG when intractable chylothorax or chylomediastinum develops after anterior mediastinal surgery.
