A 60-year-old male presented to the hospital with a two-week history of cough. He had recently received a lung cancer diagnosis during a routine check-up one week prior to presentation. A chest and abdominal CT scan revealed an occupying lesion in the right upper lung, suggestive of peripheral lung cancer, as well as pathological compression fractures in the T9, T11, and L3 vertebrae. To confirm the diagnosis, a biopsy of the L3 bone metastasis was performed, with the pathology report indicating metastatic adenocarcinoma infiltrating bone tissue. Based on these clinical findings, the patient was diagnosed with LUAD with bone metastasis (T1cN3M1, Stage IVB), with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 1. Throughout the treatment period, the patient did not experience any significant adverse events, such as hepatotoxicity, immune-related pneumonitis, musculoskeletal pain, or rash. Follow-up chest X-ray examinations from September 2023 to October 2024 demonstrated complete resolution of pulmonary inflammation with restoration of normal lung markings.
