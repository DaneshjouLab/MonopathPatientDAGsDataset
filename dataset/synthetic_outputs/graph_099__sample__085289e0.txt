A 63-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), former smoker (35 pack-years history, quit smoking one year prior), coronary artery disease, non-obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and obstructive sleep apnea underwent screening low-dose chest CT. The CT showed a new 1-cm spiculated lesion in the inferior aspect of the right upper lobe (RUL). PET-CT showed a markedly hypermetabolic (SUV = 13.1) spiculated RUL pulmonary nodule, consistent with malignancy. An adjacent tiny satellite nodule was also revealed, consistent with an additional site of malignancy. The patient then underwent a needle biopsy of the RUL nodule. Immunostains were positive for Napsin-A and thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1), and staining was negative for CK5/6 and P40, leading to a diagnosis of non-small cell carcinoma, favoring poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, clinical stage T2aN0M0. Due to poor pulmonary function, the patient was deemed not a surgical candidate and underwent stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). After completing SBRT, CT scans every six months for the next four years showed stable post-radiation fibrosis of the right upper lobe (RUL). Chest CT scans also showed small bilateral pulmonary nodules that intermittently increased and decreased in size, believed to be benign and likely represented previous histoplasmosis fungal infection.
