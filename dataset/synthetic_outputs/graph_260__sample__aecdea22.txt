A 67-year-old man presented with acute-onset hemoptysis, cough, and mild dyspnea for the past 7 years. He has a 40 pack-year history of smoking and type 2 diabetes diagnosed > 13 years ago. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) showed a usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern with traction bronchiectasis and peripheral honeycombing, bibasilar-predominant. A non-enhancing nodular opacity in the right upper lobe, suggesting pulmonary tuberculosis, and a 25-mm contrast-enhancing nodule in the right lower lobe were also observed. Based on clinical and radiological features, a diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) was made. Bronchoscopy demonstrated a neoplasm in the sub-segmental posterior basal segment of the right lower lobe. Biopsy of the tumor revealed pulmonary squamous cell lung cancer. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) sample from the right upper lobe was negative for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and cytology. The cancer was clinically staged as T1cN0M0, indicating no evidence of metastatic cancer. An initial chest CT scan showed a tumor in the right lower lobe. Follow-up chest radiograph revealed complete regression of the tumor 1 month after the first cycle of chemotherapy. Complete disappearance of the tumor was noted 2 years after the first presentation. Serial chest CT scans later showed enlargement of nodular opacities in the right upper lobe. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was cultured from the sputum sample submitted at the last evaluation.
