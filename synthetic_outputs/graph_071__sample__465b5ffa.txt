A 46-year-old man with a history of 50 pack-years of tobacco smoking was admitted to the Department of Pulmonary Diseases. He presented with a large mass in the middle region of the left lung interflowing with enlarged left hilum on chest X-ray and a spiculated tumor in the left lung hilum on chest CT. The patient reported progressive tiredness in the last 5 months, recurrent sub-febrile states, productive cough, and occasional dyspnea in the last 1.5 months. These symptoms did not resolve despite empiric treatment with three antibiotic therapies. The patient was not taking any long-term medications and had not been diagnosed with any disease. He lived in a city with over 500,000 inhabitants, in a flat on the third floor with his wife and son, and worked in an office. His parents and wife were also smokers.

Upon admission, the patient was in fairly good general condition and his vital signs were within normal limits. Muted vesicular breath sounds were noted at the bottom of the left lung. Laboratory blood tests revealed a high white blood cell count and elevated C-reactive protein: WBC 16.9x10^9/l, NEU 13.8x10^9/l, CRP 91.6 mg/l. Chest X-ray revealed a large mass in the left lung, extending to the mediastinum. CT scan showed a nodular lesion in the left lung. Abdominal ultrasound showed no abnormal results.

The patient underwent lung spirometry, which revealed irreversible severe airflow obstruction: FEV1=1.12l (47% of predicted value), FVC=1.96l (65% of predicted value), and FEV1/FVC=57.32%. After receiving 400 mcg of salbutamol, FEV1 was 1.43l (60% of predicted value), FVC was 2.24l (74% of predicted value), and FEV1/FVC was 63.97%. The bronchodilator test was positive. Lung spirometry revealed moderate irreversible airflow obstruction: FEV1=2.30l (61% of predicted value), FVC=3.71l (78% of predicted value), FEV1/FVC=62.11%, and after 400 mcg of salbutamol FEV1=2.
