A patient presented with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The patient underwent a nephrectomy. Follow-up chest and abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed recurrence and metastasis. The patient subsequently developed respiratory symptoms, including right chest pain and dyspnea. Imaging revealed right pleural effusion and multiple pleural masses, indicative of pleural metastasis from the RCC. The patient had a history of right RCC, clinical stage 3, with clear cell type histology, grade 2. Histopathological examination revealed hemorrhage, necrosis, scarring, and pseudocapsule formation involving the renal parenchyma, renal vein, and inferior vena cava. Distant metastases were found in the lungs, bones, brain, and liver. The patient underwent surgical resection under general anesthesia for localized pleural metastases. Adjuvant chemotherapy was administered. The patient was also diagnosed with malignant pleural mesothelioma and synovial sarcoma.
