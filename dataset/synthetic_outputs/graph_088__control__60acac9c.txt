A 69-year-old female with a long-standing history of a seizure disorder was diagnosed with stage IV EGFR exon 19 deletion positive lung adenocarcinoma. After experiencing persistent, worsening chest wall pain, she was found to have osseous and CNS metastases. Further comprehensive staging scans, including brain MRI, identified brain metastases with two small enhancing areas in the right pre- and postcentral gyri, consistent with metastatic lesions. Additionally, there were small metastases in the anterior aspect of the left temporal bone. MRI of the thoracic spine revealed multiple metastases in the thoracic spine, some of which extended into the epidural space at T3, causing moderate canal stenosis and dorsal cord flattening. At T8, there was mild canal stenosis, and a compression fracture with retropulsion was observed at T12. After nine months on osimertinib, 160 mg daily, she developed a recurrent right pleural effusion that required pleural catheter insertion with pleural fluid cytology repeatedly negative for malignant cells. However, 10 months after osimertinib initiation, her fourth thoracentesis performed on the left side was positive for malignant cells confirming the first definitive evidence of disease progression on osimertinib. She developed a symptomatic pulmonary embolism following three cycles of chemotherapy and elected to discontinue chemotherapy due to worsening anorexia, fatigue, as well as the development of progressive cytopenias.
