A 67-year-old female patient was diagnosed with advanced lung adenocarcinoma harboring an EGFR 19-del mutation. She was treated with EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs), which initially improved her survival, as is typical for patients with EGFR-sensitive mutations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, after EGFR-TKIs treatment, the patient developed drug resistance. Secondary pathological tissue biopsy confirmed squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) transformation. This pathological transformation to SCC is a relatively rare mechanism of acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs. The case highlights SCC transformation as one of the acquired resistance mechanisms of EGFR-TKIs in advanced lung adenocarcinoma with EGFR mutations.
