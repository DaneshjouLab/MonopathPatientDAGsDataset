An elderly man presented with chest pain and shortness of breath. He had a background of left lower lobe small cell lung cancer, previously treated with chemotherapy. The patient developed iron deficiency anemia requiring transfusion. An oesophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed, highlighting an external compression to the distal stomach and a 15 mm round lesion, with a central ulcerated depression and rolled edges in D3, which was suspicious of malignancy. A biopsy was performed on the lesion. Target biopsies confirmed the malignant nature of the lesion with features of small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, in keeping with a lung metastasis. A duodenal mucosa biopsy revealed villi infiltrated by crushed blue small-sized tumour cells, consistent with a poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma of small cell type with lymphatic invasion. Neoplastic cells were positive for the neuroendocrine marker synaptophysin.
