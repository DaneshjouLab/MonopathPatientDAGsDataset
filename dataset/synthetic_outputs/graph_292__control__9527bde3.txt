A patient presented with drug-induced interstitial lung disease (DI-ILD), also referred to as DI-ILD and pneumonitis. The patient experienced dyspnea and hypoxia. Radiographic imaging revealed ground-glass opacities. The patient's pneumonitis was noted alongside tumor growth and progression. The patient again experienced dyspnea, hypoxia, and ground-glass opacities, along with pleural effusions. Pneumonitis was again observed, concurrent with tumor progression. The patient was diagnosed with Drug-induced ILD, also referred to as DI-ILD. The patient exhibited progressive respiratory symptoms and radiographic pulmonary abnormalities. The patient was diagnosed with DI-ILD. The patient presented with fever, dyspnea, and cough. The patient was diagnosed with DI-ILD. Pathological findings revealed diffuse alveolar damage, organizing pneumonia, and eosinophilic pneumonia. Further examination showed diffuse alveolar damage, hyaline membrane formation, and exudative edema. The patient experienced hypoxia and ground-glass opacities, progressing to adult respiratory distress syndrome. The patient was diagnosed with DI-ILD and diffuse alveolar damage. The patient was diagnosed with DI-ILD and focal opacities. The patient was diagnosed with DI-ILD.
