A patient presented with a complex medical history involving multiple clinical events. The patient experienced dyspnea, cough, and hemoptysis, suggestive of underlying pulmonary issues. Initial investigations revealed lung cancer, later specified as metastatic lung adenocarcinoma. The patient also suffered from multiple cerebrovascular accidents, including strokes.

Further investigation revealed the presence of Pulmonary Vein Thrombosis (PVT), also described as thrombosis of the vein and pulmonary venous narrowing. The patient also had atrial fibrillation. The patient's condition was further complicated by hyper-viscosity syndromes, potentially related to polycythemia, hemoglobinopathies, and sickle cell disease. The patient's condition was also complicated by the presence of atrial myxoma.

The patient underwent a lobectomy and radiofrequency catheter ablation, likely in an attempt to manage the lung cancer and atrial fibrillation, respectively. Lung transplantation was also considered. Despite these interventions, the patient experienced peripheral embolization, indicating the persistence of embolism and thrombosis. The patient's condition was attributed to malignancy-related etiologies, including direct extension of the tumor and the overall malignancy burden. Turbulent flow and stasis were also identified as contributing factors to the thrombotic events. The patient's PVT was a recurring issue.
