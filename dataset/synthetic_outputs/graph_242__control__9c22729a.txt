A patient with resectable non-small cell lung cancer, specifically squamous cell lung carcinoma, received neoadjuvant therapy consisting of nivolumab and chemotherapy followed by surgery. The neoadjuvant chemotherapy and nivolumab aimed to reduce residual disease. Preoperative tumour response was assessed using RECIST criteria, with some patients achieving partial response (PR). Metabolic responses were also evaluated using 18F‐fluorodeoxyglucose‐positron emission tomography (FDG‐PET). The study investigated whether metabolic response on FDG-PET could be a predictor of pathological complete response (pCR) and longer event‐free survival (EFS). In resected tumours, pCR was correlated with improved event-free survival. The study suggests that metabolic response assessed by FDG-PET during neoadjuvant treatment may predict tumour response and pCR, ultimately influencing event-free survival.
