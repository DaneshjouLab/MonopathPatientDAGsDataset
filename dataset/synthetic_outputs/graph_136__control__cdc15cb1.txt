An 86-year-old female with a history of widely metastatic small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) with metastasis to the liver, bone, and lymph nodes presented to the hospital following a fall due to weakness, dizziness, slurred speech, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain occurring 6 days after receiving her first nivolumab infusion.

Four months prior to the nivolumab infusion, she was found to have progressive disease in the left hilum, and she underwent palliative radiation therapy in May and June 2017. In late August 2017, she was found to have further progressive disease on imaging with metastasis to the liver, bones, and right upper lobe. Biopsy of the liver confirmed small-cell carcinoma. She subsequently underwent 4 cycles of carboplatin and etoposide starting in September 2017. Her treatment was complicated by severe fatigue and hospital admission for febrile neutropenia requiring significant dose reductions. Despite these complications, she had a very good response on imaging after the second cycle of therapy in October 2017. She completed treatment in December 2017 and was placed on observation to allow for recovery time following treatment.

She received the cycle 1, day 1 infusion of nivolumab 240 mg on February 21, 2018. On the day of treatment, she had significant bilateral lower extremity edema. After extensive evaluation following her fall, the patient was diagnosed with tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) with hyperkalemia, acute renal failure, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia. She was treated aggressively with intravenous fluids, rasburicase, and sodium polystyrene sulfate (KayexalateÂ®), which resulted in rapid improvement of her electrolytes and renal function. However, despite correction of electrolytes and overall symptomatic improvement, over the course of several days, the patient's condition rapidly deteriorated with increasing dyspnea, lethargy, confusion, and eventually death.
