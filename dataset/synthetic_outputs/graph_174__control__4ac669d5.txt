Assessment of Feasibility and Prognostic Value of Sentinel Lymph Node Identification by Near-Infrared Fluorescence in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer in Patients Undergoing Robotic Anatomic Lung Resections.

Radical surgical resection remains the standard for diagnosis, staging, and treatment in patients with localized non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), including stage I NSCLC. In addition to parenchymal resection, systematic nodal dissection (SND) is recommended. However, SMD is performed in less than 40% of patients with stage I NSCLC and can eventually associate complications such as chylothorax, pleural effusion, bleeding, bronchial fistula, oesophageal injury, and nerve damage.

A prospective, observational, single-centre study was conducted to assess the feasibility and prognostic value of SLN mapping by fluorescence imaging with ICG in lung cancer surgery. The inclusion criteria consisted of adult patients with proven or suspected peripheral surgically resectable NSCLC, without evidence of lymph node disease in the preoperative study who underwent robotic anatomical lung resection with SND between September 2020 and June 2022.

Further analyses focus on patients who had a successfully identified SNL (17 cases) and whose pathological examination confirmed a primary lung malignancy (14 cases). In one case, invasion of the SLN by metastasis was identified, corresponding to a lymph node upstaging of 7.1%. Two cases with negative SLN had a pN+ result in the definitive histological analysis (one intraparenchymal pN1 case and one skip-N2 metastasis pN2 case (negative SLN in region 11R and N2+ in region 7)).
