A 63-year-old female presented with fecal incontinence, debilitating headaches, right arm weakness, gait instability, and a recent ground-level fall. This prompted imaging studies which revealed an 8 cm area of cerebral edema in the left parietal lobe, a 3.5 cm mass in the superior segment of the lower lobe of the right lung, numerous subcentimeter nodules throughout the lung parenchyma, and hilar lymphadenopathy. A CT-guided lung core needle biopsy confirmed invasive non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) with a prominent lepidic pattern. Lung mass biopsy revealed lung adenocarcinoma with a predominantly lepidic pattern. Immunohistochemical analysis showed positive staining for TTF-1, Napsin A, CK7, and CK5/6, and negative staining for CK20, P40, chromogranin, and synaptophysin. The cell proliferation index was estimated to be less than 3% via Ki-67 stains. Genpath OnkoSight histologic and tissue tumor next-generation sequencing revealed an EGFR Glu 757-Ala 750 deletion mutation, a rare exon 19 deletion variant.

The patient was treated with osimertinib. After 17 months of treatment with osimertinib, lung mass biopsy showed lung carcinosarcoma with islands of sarcomatoid spindled cells among solid epithelioid components (H&E, 200x). Biopsy of primary lung mass at initial diagnosis (Ki-67, 200x) showed positive staining in <5% of cells. Resistance to first- and second-generation TKIs developed. Collection date 2024 Apr. This was attributed to the development of resistance to osimertinib due to acquired resistance mechanisms, including EGFR-dependent and EGFR-independent mechanisms such as acquired EGFR mutations, amplifications, genetic fusions, MAPK-PI3K mutations, cell cycle gene alterations, and histologic transformation. After 17 months of treatment with osimertinib, fine-needle aspiration of 11R lymph node (Ki-67, 200x) showed Ki-67 positivity in >90% of cells.

The patient underwent stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and continued treatment with osimertinib 80 mg daily. After more than 17 months of treatment, follow-up imaging showed progressive and recurrent brain and chest lesions. Endobronchial ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration of the 11R lymph node confirmed a poorly differentiated malignancy consistent with metastatic carcinosarcoma. Further characterization of the metastatic recurrent lung cancer revealed a biphasic morphology with solid sheets of pleomorphic, neoplastic mesenchymal cells interspersed with small islands of neoplastic epithelial cells. Immunocytochemistry of 11R lymph node sample demonstrated positive staining for TTF-1, AE1/AE3, EMA, CD56, and vimentin with negative staining for CK7, P40, napsin, calretinin, PAX-8, S-100, synaptophysin, and chromogranin. Ki-67 staining revealed an estimated cell proliferation index of 90%. Foundation one next-generation sequencing identified an additional EGFR exon 19 deletion (E746_A750del) in addition to the previously identified EGFR G796C and 1744V point mutations. Notable novel mutations were also found.
