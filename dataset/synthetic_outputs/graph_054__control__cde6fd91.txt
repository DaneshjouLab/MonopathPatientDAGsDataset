A patient presented with acute abdomen pain, leading to the discovery of small intestine and mid-lower intestine intussusception. The patient underwent intussusception surgery. Pathological examination revealed intestinal lesions, initially leading to a misdiagnosis as primary intestinal tumors with ALK rearrangement. Further investigation revealed the intestinal lesions to be intestinal metastasis originating from pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma, specifically intestinal metastasis of ALK-positive pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma, or intestinal metastasis of an ALK-rearranged pulmonary adenocarcinoma. The patient was diagnosed with Small intestine metastasis in ALK-rearrangement lung cancer. The initial misdiagnosis was due to the resemblance of the intestinal lesions to inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT), ALK-positive IMT, epithelioid inflammatory myofibroblastic sarcoma (EIMS), or other ALK-positive gastrointestinal neoplasms. The differential diagnosis also included inflammatory spindle cell lesions of the cavum abdominals, IMT and anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). The patient was treated with ALK-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) therapy. Despite treatment, the patient experienced metastasis or recurrence, reflecting the poor prognosis of ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer. The patient's condition ultimately resulted in small bowel obstruction caused by lung carcinoma and local or distant metastases.
