We report on a 68-year-old male patient treated for multiple myeloma in our clinic since 2006. In 2017, the patient was diagnosed with non-resectable [T3 N0 M1b (bilateral lung lesions and soft tissue chest wall metastasis)] squamous subtype non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by image-guided biopsy. The myeloma was reasonably controlled (partial response) at time of NSCLC diagnosis with an ongoing carfilzomib/daratumumab/dexamethasone 5th-line therapy. Prior treatments included lenalidomide, bortezomib, high-dose melphalan and autologous stem cell transplant, pomalidomide and dexamethasone, thalidomide, cisplatin, adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide (DT-PACE), to which the myeloma was either refractory or the patient intolerant due to toxicity. Relevant medical history included chronic thrombocytopenia of likely autoimmune pathogenesis and deep vein thrombosis and extensive pulmonary embolism in 2016, contributing to persistent dyspnoea. Patient performance status at time of NSCLC diagnosis was ECOG 1.

In contrast to the NSCLC, the myeloma did not respond to pembrolizumab and paraprotein levels continued to rise over 10 months of concurrent pembrolizumab and anti-myeloma therapy until clinical progression, with transfusion-dependent anaemia and severe dyspnoea and fatigue, resulting in reduced performance status [Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 2]. The patient reported no immune-related adverse events and response evaluation by computed tomography imaging continued to demonstrate an ongoing partial response of the NSCLC.

No approved and/or suitable anti-myeloma treatments were available at the time and NSCLC excluded the patient from participation in clinical trials. A bone marrow myeloma fluorescence *in situ* hybridisation analysis was performed based on emerging data on venetoclax activity in myeloma, and a t(11;14) translocation was detected.

The patient's myeloma responded rapidly to venetoclax, reaching partial response after two and very good partial response after four cycles of therapy.
