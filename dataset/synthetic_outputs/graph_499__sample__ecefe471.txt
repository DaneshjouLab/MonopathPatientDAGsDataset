A 64-year-old patient, a chronic smoker for 40 years, presented with a 6-month history of dry cough and mMRC stage 2 dyspnea. One month prior to presentation, the dyspnea worsened to mMRC stage 3. The patient's condition worsened, leading to acute respiratory distress, characterized by desaturation to 78% in ambient air, polypnea at 25 cycles per minute, cyanosis of the extremities, signs of respiratory struggle, and crackles on the left side of the pleuropulmonary region. A diagnostic workup was initiated to investigate the cause of respiratory distress. Chest X-ray showed bilateral alveolar opacities. Lab results revealed hypereosinophilia (up to 1170), a hemoglobin level at 15.9g/l, white blood cells at 13,700/mm3, platelets at 320,000/mm3, correct renal function, a negative COVID-19 PCR test, a negative GeneXpert for tuberculosis in the sputum, and a negative cytobacteriological examination of the sputum. Stool parasitology was also negative. Further imaging was performed to characterize lung abnormalities. A thoracic CT scan showed diffuse foci of pulmonary parenchymal condensation, involving the various pulmonary lobes with areas of ground glass. Chest CT showed bilateral consolidations with ground glass. Bronchoscopy and biopsies were performed to evaluate lung abnormalities. Bronchial fibroscopy showed a normal endoscopic appearance. Staged bronchial biopsies returned to normal, fibroaspiration in search of neoplastic cells did not detect tumor cells, and the patient did not tolerate BAL. Spirometry objectified a ventilatory disorder of restrictive pace with a forced vital capacity at 3.02l or 43%. Further diagnostic evaluation was planned.
