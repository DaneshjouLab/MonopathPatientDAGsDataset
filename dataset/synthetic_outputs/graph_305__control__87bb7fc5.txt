A patient with advanced lung adenocarcinoma harboring an *EGFR* exon 19 deletion initially responded to osimertinib with progression-free survival (PFS) lasting 11 months. The patient subsequently developed resistance to osimertinib with an acquired *MET* D1228N mutation. Based on these findings, the patient with *MET* D1228N mutant lung adenocarcinoma clinically benefited from combinatorial therapy of cabozantinib and osimertinib after osimertinib resistance. This is the first reported case of *MET* D1228N mutation mediating acquired resistance to osimertinib in a MET TKI-na√Øve NSCLC patient who subsequently benefited from the combinational therapy of EGFR and MET TKIs.
