A 48-year-old male with a 14 pack-year smoking history was admitted with cough and back pain. This prompted further investigation, including a chest CT, which revealed a 77 mm mass in the lower lobe of the right lung with left atrial invasion, enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes (#2R, 4R, #7, and # 2L), right hilar lymph nodes, and right pleural effusion. These findings led to a transbronchial lung biopsy for diagnosis. Histopathological IHC of the biopsy revealed TTF-1 positive adenocarcinoma. Based on these findings and further molecular profiling, the patient was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma, cT4N3M1a, stage IVA. IHC analysis indicated that the tumor cells were positive for ALK antibody (clone D5F3, VENTANA). Molecular analysis revealed an EML4-ALK fusion V1 (E13:A20). IHC analysis using programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) IHC 22C3 pharmDx assay showed high PD-L1 expression with a tumor proportion score (TPS) of 100%. Further analysis for MSI status was performed. Analysis by electrophoresis of the PCR products revealed that the case was MSI-high. Immunohistochemistry for mismatch repair proteins (MMR) MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 was performed. The nuclei of the tumor cells were positive for MLH1 and PMS2 but negative for MSH2 and MSH6 indicating MSI status with MSH2 gene disruption.
