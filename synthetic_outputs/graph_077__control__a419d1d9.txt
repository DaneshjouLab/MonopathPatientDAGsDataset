A 66-year-old man presented with cough, sputum, chest tightness, and weight loss persisting for 1 month. Chest X-ray revealed a space-occupying lesion in the left lung. Further CT imaging demonstrated irregular soft tissue masses in both the upper and lower lobes of the left lung. Although the imaging findings suggested lung cancer, the final pathological diagnosis confirmed acute fibrinous and organising pneumonia (AFOP). The patient was treated with methylprednisolone, resulting in substantial improvement of the upper lobe lesion, whereas the lower lobe lesion showed minimal response. Following the addition of mycophenolate mofetil, the lower lobe lesion decreased substantially. Multiple lung biopsies confirmed the diagnosis of AFOP, with no evidence of a malignant tumour. Acute fibrinous and organising pneumonia presenting with mass-like imaging: a case report.
