In 2018, a 5.5 mm ground-glass opacity (GGO) was found in the right upper lobe on a chest CT during a health check-up. The patient was asymptomatic, and the physical examination was unremarkable.

In 2019, a 41-year-old female presented to the Thoracic Clinic with a history of a 7-mm ground-glass opacity (GGO) in the right upper lobe with mixed-density on chest computed tomography (CT) scan. The ground-glass opacity (GGO) in the right upper lobe increased from 5.5 mm to 7 mm with mixed-density over one year. Lesion radiation characteristics associated with malignant disease, showing mixed density and spiculation. CT and bronchopulmonary vascular 3-dimensional (3D) reconstruction suggested that a planned resection of S3b + S1bi would ensure adequate margins. Lesion enlarged 1 year later. CT revealed that the lesion was approximately 2 cm from the beginning of B1bii. Branching patterns of inferior trunk (tr. Inf): A3a + A1bii.

The patient underwent surgery via a 3.5-cm single-port incision between the midaxillary line and the posterior axillary line in the right 4th intercostal space, lasting approximately 200 min, with an intraoperative blood loss of approximately 40 mL. Frozen sections indicated in-situ adenocarcinoma, which was confirmed in the paraffin sections.

Thoracic drainage tube was withdrawn 4 days after surgery. The patient was discharged on the 5th postoperative day without complications or adverse events, except slight chest pain that lasted for about 2 weeks postoperatively.

Chest CT scans in the 12th and 24th months after surgery showed good lung recovery, and no atelectasis or pulmonary congestion was observed.
