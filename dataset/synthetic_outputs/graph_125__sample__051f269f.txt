A 78-year-old Caucasian man with a history of permanent left side muscle weakness due to previous poliovirus infection, hypertension (on losartan and metoprolol), hyperlipidemia (on atorvastatin), and diabetes mellitus (on glimepiride) presented to the emergency department with hypoxia. He had shortness of breath and productive cough for one week. Oxygen saturation on room air was 84% at the nursing facility. He was recently diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis and was started on apixaban.

Upon arrival, the patient transitioned from the nursing facility to the emergency department. His initial hypoxia improved with oxygen supplementation. Physical exam revealed he was afebrile, respiratory rate of 16 breath per minute, heart rate of 90 beats per minute, oxygen saturation 96% on room air, and blood pressure of 132/75 mmHg. Chest examination revealed bilateral end-expiratory wheezes. Neurological examination showed left upper and lower limb power of 3/5 as compared to 5/5 on the right side, with no facial asymmetry, gaze, aphasia, or sensory loss, unchanged from baseline.

The patient developed an elevated white blood cell count of 21.4 thousand cells per microliter with absolute neutrophils (83%). Electrocardiogram and arterial blood gas were within normal limits. Chest radiograph showed right basilar opacity, leading to a diagnosis of pneumonia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were initiated.

A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed, revealing a left ventricle ejection fraction of 60% to 65% with grade 1 diastolic dysfunction and left ventricular hypertrophy with no significant valvular pathology.

A blood culture was positive for coagulase-negative staphylococci in one out of two bottles.

A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) showed poorly defined multiple subtle echo densities on the atrial side of the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve and on the ventricular side of the aortic valve mostly at the coaptation edges with no significant valvular damage suggestive of sterile vegetations.

Given pneumonia and bacteremia, infective endocarditis was initially considered, and a plan for a prolonged course of antibiotics was elected. A cardiologist advised checking for underlying malignancy given recent deep venous thrombosis and lung consolidation on chest radiograph.

A CT chest showed a mass-like consolidation in the posterior right lobe with evidence of metastasis with multiple bony lytic lesions and pleural metastasis. Blood cultures were subsequently determined to be contamination.

The patient and his family decided not to proceed with any further investigations and opted for comfort care measures only.
