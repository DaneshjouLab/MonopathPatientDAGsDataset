A patient presented with symptoms of pain and pitting edema. Initial investigations revealed deep vein thrombosis (DVT), specifically popliteal vein thrombosis. The patient was treated with heparin and subsequently transitioned to warfarin for anticoagulation.

Further investigation revealed a subdural hematoma, requiring a craniotomy. During this period, the patient also experienced anorexia and weight loss, accompanied by epigastric tenderness.

Laboratory findings showed thrombocytopenia, prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT), reduced hemoglobin concentration, elevated C-reactive protein, and a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Anti-double stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) and antinuclear antibody (ANA) tests were negative. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels were increased.

Further workup revealed a diagnosis of gastric signet ring cell adenocarcinoma with bone marrow involvement and bone metastasis. Imaging studies showed hypodense lesions in the liver, consistent with metastases, small nodules in the right lung, metastatic lesions in the vertebra, and multiple calcified nodules in both lobes.

The patient was also diagnosed with Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), characterized by arterial thrombosis, venous thrombosis, small-vessel thrombosis, and a history of pregnancy-related morbidity. The presence of anticardiolipin antibody and anti-beta2-glycoprotein I confirmed the APS diagnosis.

The patient's cancer was determined to be distinct from renal cancer, lung carcinoma, and breast tumors.
