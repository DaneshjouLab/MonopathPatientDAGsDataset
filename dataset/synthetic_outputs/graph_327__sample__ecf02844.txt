A 40-year-old male presented with intermittent chest pain and discomfort for one month. The pain was located on the right side of the sternum, about the size of a palm, and was not significantly relieved after rest. The patient reported no cough, sputum, throat irritation, fever, or significant weight change in the past six months.

The patient denied pet exposure, special dust exposure, smoking history, drinking history, recent travel, and recent dental work. His vital signs were: Temperature 36.5Â°C, pulse rate 84 bpm, respiration 20 breaths/min, blood pressure 114/75 mmHg.

The chest pain symptoms were somewhat relieved by oral Ibuprofen, but the effect quickly receded. A chest CT scan revealed a 3.8 cm space-occupying lesion in the upper lobe of the right lung with clear boundaries and uneven internal density. The radiologist suggested it may be a benign lesion, possibly a haematoma.

Further imaging with a 16-slice computed tomographic scan showed a mass image in the upper lobe of the right lung adjacent to the chest wall. The tubercle boundary was clear and the internal density was uneven. Careful examination showed that the mass had a pedicle. The lung lesion was then diagnosed as a schwannoma.

A needle biopsy confirmed the lesion as a schwannoma. The fine needle puncture procedure was smooth, with no complications such as bleeding or pneumothorax.

The patient underwent video-assisted thoracic surgery in an outside hospital but was lost to follow-up. Histologic diagnosis from the mass confirmed schwannoma.

Histopathology of the resected mass showed: Microscopic histological examination demonstrated the presence of proliferating Schwann cells characterized by spindle-shaped nuclei and pointed ends. Immunohistochemistry: S100+, CD34+, EMA+, CD56+, CD117, Calretinin+, Vimentin+, Desmin-, smooth muscle antigen-.
