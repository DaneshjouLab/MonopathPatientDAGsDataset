A 72-year-old Korean man with a past medical history of ICD insertion for idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (device: Medtronic Protecta XT VRD354VRM; lead: Medtronic Sprint Quattro Secure Model 6947) presented in 2019 with a 1-month history of a dry cough. He had a 50-pack-year history of smoking. Family history was negative for any malignancy. Chest x-ray and contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed a conglomerate nodal mass in the left central lung and left hilar area. Bronchoscopy with needle biopsy revealed nests of atypical cells with hyperchromatic nuclei. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed cells positive for neuroendocrine markers CD56 and chromogranin, and negative for CD45RO. His serum lactate dehydrogenase level was elevated (337 U/L). Positron emission tomography excluded any additional disease localizations. He was diagnosed with a limited stage of small cell lung cancer in the left lung (cT4N2M0 by TNM staging). Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) was recommended, but he refused CCRT because of fear of toxicity. The tumor showed partial remission after four cycles of chemotherapy (cisplatin 25 mg/m2 on days 1, 2, and 3 and etoposide 100 mg/m2 on days 1, 2, and 3). He was then referred for sequential thoracic radiotherapy with ICD monitoring by a cardiologist. He was treated with radiotherapy with a prescribed dose of 60 Gy in 30 fractions five times per week. During thoracic radiotherapy, the mean and maximum doses of ICD were 0.73 Gy and 1.43 Gy, respectively, in the body. The mean and maximum doses of the lead and electrode were 17.12 Gy and 55.72 Gy in the lead and 1.81 Gy and 7.10 Gy in the electrode, respectively. Radiation was delivered by linear accelerator (Varian Clinac 21EX) using 10-MV 3.
