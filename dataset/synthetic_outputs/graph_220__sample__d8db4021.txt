A series of clinical cases highlight the potential for gastrointestinal (GI) metastasis from various primary cancers, leading to a range of symptoms and outcomes. Patients presenting with abdominal pain, weight loss, nausea, and overt bleeding may be experiencing GI metastasis. Weight loss often stems from early satiety, inadequate calorie intake, and heightened catabolism, with nausea and abdominal pain further complicating food intake. GI metastasis can manifest as dysphagia when the oesophagus is involved, alongside symptoms of nausea, vomiting, bloating, and abdominal pain. Endoscopic examination may reveal nodules or ulcers indicative of metastasis.

The following cases illustrate this phenomenon:

A 72-year-old male with a history of Renal clear cell carcinoma presented with bleeding in the gastric body, specifically upper GI bleeding and melaena.

Another 72-year-old male, also with Renal clear cell carcinoma, initially presented with abdominal pain. His condition later deteriorated, culminating in a fatal upper GI bleeding event.

A 69-year-old male with Renal clear cell carcinoma presented with haematemesis originating from the duodenum.

A 76-year-old male with Prostate cancer presented with upper GI bleeding and melaena, with the source of bleeding identified in the duodenum.

A 63-year-old male with Melanoma presented with upper GI bleeding and melaena, also originating from the duodenum.

A 76-year-old male with Non-small cell lung cancer presented with acute peritonitis due to bowel perforation in the jejunum.

Finally, a 48-year-old male with Renal cell carcinoma presented with upper GI bleeding and melaena, with the source of bleeding identified in the omentum.
