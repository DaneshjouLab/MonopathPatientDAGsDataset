An 11-year-old, castrated, male Toy Poodle was presented with hypercortisolemia. The dog was diagnosed with an adrenal tumor (AT) and treated with mitotane. Repeated adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation tests revealed improvement in the dog’s condition with mitotane treatment. However, the dog's condition started declining 197 days post-diagnosis, and he died on day 280. A necropsy revealed the AT was a pheochromocytoma, not an adrenocortical tumor. Because of no pathological change in the pituitary gland and the other adrenal gland, the malignant pheochromocytoma was presumed to be the cause of ectopic Cushing’s syndrome (ECS). In humans, ectopic Cushing’s syndrome (ECS) is characterized by hypercortisolemia, which is caused by small lung carcinoma, bronchial carcinoids, and pheochromocytoma. In dogs, only a few cases of ECS associated with pheochromocytoma have been reported to date.
