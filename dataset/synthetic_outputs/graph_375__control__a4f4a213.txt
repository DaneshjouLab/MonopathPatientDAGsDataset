The morbidity and mortality of lung cancer have always ranked first among malignant tumors. Radical surgical resection of early non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the preferred local treatment method. For locally advanced lung cancer, there are many treatment options for resectable stage III NSCLC; however, there is considerable controversy concerning the best treatment mode. The 5-year overall survival (OS) rates for IIIA, IIIB and IIIC were 36%, 26%, and 13% respectively. Relevant studies have shown that neoadjuvant + surgery + adjuvant therapy may yield the longest OS in patients with advanced NSCLC, and in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines on resectable stage III NSCLC, all recommendations indicate neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy + surgery + postoperative adjuvant therapy.

The 2010 and 2014 NSCLC meta-analysis cooperative group studies established the status of neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy. Previous studies have shown that neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy can improve the 5-year survival rate of patients with NSCLC, but only by about 5%, with limited benefit and high toxicity. In contrast, immunotherapy has shown significant efficacy in advanced NSCLC. Related studies have shown that immunotherapy can significantly extend the OS and progression-free survival (PFS) of patients. But the benefits of neoadjuvant immunotherapy are still being examined. Neoadjuvant immunotherapy further utilizes the primary tumor as
