A 70-year-old white woman presented in November 2002 with pain in a left lower quadrant abdominal mass. Physical examination revealed a mass fixed within the abdominal wall musculature within the left lower quadrant of the abdomen.

On March 4, 2003, the patient underwent a 9-hour surgical procedure to remove mesothelioma from the abdominal wall, abdomen, and pelvis. Resection of the mass from the left lower aspect of the abdominal wall required resection of the lower one-half of the rectus abdominus muscle and adjacent abdominal wall musculature to the iliac crest.

On November 11, 2003, a CT scan showed an 11 cm mass within the anterior abdominal wall and a 5 cm by 2.9 cm mass associated with the right colon. No disease was seen outside the abdomen and pelvis. Biopsy of the abdominal wall mass showed malignant peritoneal mesothelioma.

The resected specimen measured 15 cm × 12 cm × 7 cm. Greater omentectomy and splenectomy, peritoneum from beneath the right hemidiaphragm, tumor nodules from small bowel and its mesentery, and complete pelvic peritonectomy with resection of rectosigmoid colon, uterus, Fallopian tubes and ovaries were performed.

The patient was treated with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) after complete cytoreduction.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful.

Eighteen months postoperatively, a CT scan showed multiple lung metastases.

The patient died of progressive malignant mesothelioma in July 2005, 29 months after cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC. The malignant mesothelioma tumor was located in the left lower quadrant of the abdominal wall at the anatomic site of a Spigelian hernia.

Malignant peritoneal mesothelioma was widely distributed on the peritoneal surfaces of the abdomen and pelvis. The largest tumor accumulation was within the Spigelian hernia sac. Tumor was present within the omentum in large volume. Malignant mesothelioma was layered out on the peritoneal surface of the right hemidiaphragm, surface of the spleen and pelvic peritoneal surfaces.
