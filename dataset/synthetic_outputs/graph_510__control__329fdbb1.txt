A 35-year-old man without any symptoms was found to have pulmonary nodules during a routine health assessment 2 years prior to presentation. The pulmonary nodules progressively enlarged with follow-up. The patient had a 15-year smoking history of approximately 1 pack of cigarettes per day and no family history of hereditary disease or cancer. On February 15, 2023, a computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a 4.6 cm × 2.8 cm soft tissue mass in the left inferior lobe with obstructive changes. A positron emission tomography-CT (PET-CT) scan indicated high 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in the left inferior lobe mass [4.94 cm × 3.47 cm; standardized uptake value (SUV), 13.8], left hilar (stations 4L), and mediastinal lymph nodes (stations 7 and 8), strongly suggesting malignant disease and lymph nodes (stations 4L, 7, and 8) metastasis with no signs of distant metastasis. An endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial lung biopsy (EBUS-TBLB) of the left lung mass was performed. Pathological analysis showed adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemistry revealed positive staining for Napsin A, cytokeratin (CK), thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), and *ALK*. Next-generation sequencing showed echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (*EML4*)-*ALK* gene fusion. The patient was diagnosed with clinical stage IIIA [8th American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC): cT2bN2M0] pulmonary adenocarcinoma with left hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes metastasis. The patient was treated with neoadjuvant lorlatinib and achieved a pathological complete response (pCR). This case underscores the potential of lorlatinib as a neoadjuvant treatment for resectable *ALK*-positive NSCLC.
