In April 2018, a 47-year-old woman presented with dyspnea and tachycardia under exertion. Patient presented with dyspnea and tachycardia under exertion, leading to initial chest x-ray imaging. Chest x-ray showed a large mass in the left hemithorax. Chest x-ray showing a large mass in the left hemithorax prompted further investigation with a CT scan. CT scan with enhancement presented a 40 Ã— 30 cm mass involving the left upper lobe of the lung. CT scan revealed a large mass involving the left upper lobe of the lung, leading to a CT-guided biopsy. CT guided biopsy revealed a benign lung tumor. CT guided biopsy revealed a benign lung tumor, leading to a PET/CT scan to further evaluate the mass. PET/CT scan showed a very mild uptake at the level of the nodule (SUV max = 2.3) with no other signs of uptake in other parts of the body. PET/CT scan showed mild uptake at the nodule, leading to the decision for surgical removal via left upper lobectomy. Patient underwent a left upper lobectomy through lateral thoracotomy. Patient underwent a left upper lobectomy, and the specimen was sent for final histology. Final histology showed an IMT of the lung. Final histology revealed an inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) of the lung, with specific cellular marker results. Cells were positive for actin in smooth muscle, but negative for ALK, MNF116, estrogenic receptors, and tuberculosis. Following diagnosis and surgery, the oncologist recommended a follow-up schedule. Patient underwent a clinical check ten days after surgery by the oncologist who suggested a period of follow up every 6 months for the first and second year from surgery, and every year after the second year, for a total of 5 years of radiological and clinical monitoring. After surgery and initial follow-up planning, the patient was prepared for discharge. Patient was discharged six.
