A 46-year-old non-smoking Chinese man presented with a cough for over 1 month and shortness of breath for approximately 10 days. The patient's cough and shortness of breath led to further investigation via CT scan. CT scan revealed hydropneumothorax, compression atelectasis (approximately 80% collapse) and tumor mass of the right lung, and multiple nodules in the left lung. The hydropneumothorax detected on CT scan prompted pleural space drainage. Pleural space drainage revealed malignant cells in the pleural effusion. The malignant cells in pleural effusion led to ultrasound-guided percutaneous lung biopsy. Ultrasound-guided percutaneous lung biopsy showed infiltrating growth of the allotypic glandular duct, and the lesions tend to be pulmonary adenocarcinoma, with strongly positive expression for thyroid CK7, TTF-1, and Napsin A and negative for CK5/6, P40, and P60 as assayed by immunohistochemical staining. The pulmonary adenocarcinoma diagnosis prompted further imaging to assess for metastatic disease. Bone scan, brain CT scan, and ultrasonography of the abdominal system, urinary system, and cardiovascular system identified no evidence of metastatic disease. Imaging ruled out metastatic disease outside of the pleura, leading to final diagnosis. The patient was diagnosed with right lung adenocarcinoma with pleural metastasis (cT4N0M1a, stage IVa).
