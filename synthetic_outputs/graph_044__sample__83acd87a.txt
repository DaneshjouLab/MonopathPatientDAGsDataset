A 44-year-old man with a 24-year smoking history and no significant medical history presented for a physical examination, during which chest radiography revealed an enlarged shadow in the right upper mediastinum. A subsequent CT scan confirmed the presence of a mediastinal mass. The patient later visited the emergency department complaining of cough, dyspnea, and throat pain. A noncontrast CT scan performed 2 weeks prior to this admission showed a 5.0 x 5.0 cm tumor in the superior-to-anterior mediastinum. Dynamic CT at the time of admission identified a weakly enhanced tumor in the superior-to-middle mediastinum, which had grown to 9.0 x 7.0 cm over the preceding 2 weeks. The right brachiocephalic vein and superior vena cava were highly compressed and narrowed by the mass, and the trachea was left-deviated. Multiple enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, including those at the right hilum and contralateral regions, were also observed. Laboratory tests revealed slightly elevated LDH (296 IU/L) and CRP (3.29 mg/dL) levels. Tumor markers (CYFRA, pro-GRP, CEA, CA19-9) and sIL-2R were all negative. Dynamic CT axial and coronal images were obtained at admission.
