A patient presented with lung cancer, which was subsequently treated with lung cancer resection. During the course of their illness, the patient was also diagnosed with adrenal angiomyolipoma. The lung cancer recurred, leading to adrenal metastases. The patient underwent further lung cancer resection. The adrenal metastases were observed again, and the patient was diagnosed with additional instances of adrenal metastasis and adrenal angiomyolipoma. The patient continued to be monitored for lung cancer and adrenal metastasis, alongside the existing adrenal angiomyolipoma. Over time, the adrenal metastasis evolved into adrenal metastatic carcinoma and eventually adrenal carcinoma. Further investigation revealed renal cell carcinoma and a general diagnosis of cancer. The patient also had malignant tumors, adrenal adenoma, and primary.
