A previously well, 55-year-old male was referred to the emergency department by his family doctor complaining of a 3-week history of fevers, productive cough, dyspnea, and wheeze. He was admitted and treated as community acquired pneumonia, and work-up confirmed SIADH. A computerized tomography (CT) scan of his thorax revealed a right hilar mass with mediastinal involvement and right-sided hilar adenopathy with superimposed extensive air space consolidation. A biopsy performed during bronchoscopy revealed histologically monotonous, small cells with dark ovoid nuclei. No nucleoli were seen, and several mitotic figures were present. The cells have narrow ill-defined cytoplasm. Immunohistochemistry performed on the tumor cells showed CD45 negativity, AE1/AE3, TTF1 positivity. Focal minimal synaptophysin and chromogranin A positivity were also seen. This immunohistochemical profile was consistent with a diagnosis of small cell lung cancer. Full staging consisting of a CT-scan of the brain and Thorax–Abdomen–Pelvis confirmed extensive stage disease with adrenal metastases. On cycle 2 day 3 of chemotherapy, the patient developed lower back pain and bilateral lower limb weakness.
