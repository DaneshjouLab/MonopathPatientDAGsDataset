A 51-year-old female patient (born in 1970) presented in April 2013 with a subsolid pulmonary lesion incidentally detected during a routine follow-up for malignant melanoma. The patient had previously undergone resection of malignant melanoma. During this time, a suspicious lymph node in the left axilla was detected on ultrasound. Biopsy confirmed a metastasis of malignant melanoma in the left axillary lymph node, which was also confirmed by PET/CT as a solitary finding in the left axilla. In late April 2013, the patient underwent a left axillary dissection, revealing 1 of 19 lymph nodes with metastasis. Molecular genetic testing revealed a BRAF mutation at codon 600, and targeted therapy with BRAF inhibitors was initiated. Follow-up at another institution assessed the disease as stable. In November 2017, a routine CT scan of the lungs detected a new asymptomatic 7 mm lesion in segment S10 of the right lower lobe, with a density consistent with a pure ground glass nodule. A follow-up CT scan in June 2020 showed the lesion changed character to a subsolid lesion with the presence of a solid component. A PET/CT scan in July 2020 confirmed the persistence of the lesion without increased metabolic activity. By April 2021, follow-up confirmed persistence and slight size progression of the solid component of the lesion, with a lesion size of 12 mm and a solid component of 7 mm. In May 2021, the patient was indicated by the multidisciplinary pulmonary committee for surgical resection. The lesion was followed up for 4 years and subsequently resected videothoracoscopically after preoperative labeling with a mixture of blue dye and contrast agent.
