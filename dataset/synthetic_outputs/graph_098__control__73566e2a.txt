This case presents a patient with a history of non-small cell lung carcinoma who had radiation therapy complicated by esophageal dysphagia. She presented to the emergency department (ED) for dyspnea on exertion. Imaging showed a persistent right lower lobe opacity, and bronchoscopy revealed a right broncho-esophageal fistula (BEF). This case presents a patient with a right BEF caused by a migrating esophageal stent. Broncho-esophageal fistulas (BEFs) and tracheo-esophageal fistulas (TEFs) are pathological fistulas connecting the trachea or bronchi to the esophagus. Although a rare finding, over 50% of fistulas are attributed to complications of esophageal or lung malignancy and carry a high risk of morbidity and mortality. Approximately 5%-15% of individuals with esophageal malignancy develop TEF, while about 1% of those with bronchogenic carcinoma develop a fistula. Patients often present with frequent coughing after solid or liquid food intake, recurrent episodes of aspiration and pneumonia, or unexplained malnutrition. Other less common causes include prolonged endotracheal intubation, surgical or endoscopic interventions, or infectious diseases such as tuberculosis.
