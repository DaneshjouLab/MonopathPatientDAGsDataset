The patient presented with abdominal pain of grade 2, associated with nausea of grade 2, bilious vomiting of grade 3, and weight loss of grade 1. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed significant bowel wall thickening, free ascitic fluid, mesenteric congestion, and stranding. The patient subsequently underwent an anterograde enteroscopy extended to the jejunum, which revealed lymphocytic duodenitis with sub-mucosal edema.
