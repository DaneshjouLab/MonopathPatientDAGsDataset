Sarcoidosis detected after COVID‑19 with T‑SPOT.TB positive: A case report.

Sarcoidosis is an idiopathic multisystem disorder with unknown etiology. It is characterized by the presence of non-caseating epithelioid cell granulomas. Due to clinical similarities among sarcoidosis, tuberculosis (TB) infection and malignant diseases (such as lymphoma, lung carcinoma and pituitary tumor), the diagnosis can be challenging.

This report describes a case who presented with multiple lymphadenopathies throughout the body after COVID-19 and was T-SPOT.TB positive, but without lung parenchyma involvement. The patient was diagnosed with sarcoidosis manifesting as multiple lymphadenopathies. Considering the clinical features, disease history and the pathological examination results of the patient, there were no concrete elements supporting cancer, therefore sarcoidosis was deemed the most likely diagnosis.

This case report aims to suggest a possible connection between COVID-19 and sarcoidosis, and provide insights to sarcoidosis diagnosis. Tana et al proposed that there may be a link between COVID-19 and sarcoidosis, since they have similar clinical manifestations and may influence each other at multiple levels, eventually affecting their clinical courses and prognosis. Some patients with SARS-CoV-2 developed subcutaneous nodules with granulomatous histology similar to sarcoidosis.
