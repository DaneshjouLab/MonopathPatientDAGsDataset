In January 2016, a 26-year-old Caucasian woman, a former light smoker (11 pack-years) with no significant prior medical history, was admitted to the Medical Oncology Department due to a suspicious lung mass in the left lower lobe with bilateral lung lesions observed on a contrast-enhanced CT scan. She presented with low abundance hemoptysis and cervical lymphadenopathy. A cervical lymph node biopsy revealed cell morphology consistent with lung adenocarcinoma, with tumor cells positive for thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1).

Further molecular analysis by next-generation sequencing (NGS) of DNA from the cervical lymph node biopsy confirmed metastatic lung adenocarcinoma (cT3N3M1a, stage IV A). The NGS revealed two mutations in EGFR exon 18: p. G719A (C.2156G>T) and p. E709A (C 2126A>C). Immunohistochemistry showed MET hyperexpression (3+), without MET amplification. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) showed a c-MET/chromosome 7 ratio of 2.62. No other molecular alterations were found.

Based on these findings, Afatinib (40 mg daily) was initiated as first-line treatment. Two months after Afatinib initiation, a CT scan showed a partial response (-75%). The patient also experienced clinical improvement. However, she developed a grade 2 skin rash (CTCAE v5.0), which was relieved by doxycycline. The clinical and morphological response to Afatinib was confirmed for 13 months.

In June 2017, the patient experienced asymptomatic progression on lung lesions and mediastinal lymph node. NGS of circulating DNA and targeted rebiopsy revealed no resistance mutations, especially T790M. Following disease progression, cisplatin-pemetrexed was prescribed (progression-free survival (PFS), 15 months). Subsequently, carboplatin-pemetrexed was prescribed (PFS, 6 months).

A chest CT showed a lung mass in the left lower lobe at baseline. Afatinib resulted in a partial response. A chest CT before osimertinib initiation showed stable disease as best response. Baseline chest CT and contrast-enhanced liver CT were performed before neratinib initiation. One month after neratinib initiation, an early assessment showed a partial response of all lung lesions and liver lesions (a target lesion, 29.8 vs. 18.4 mm, in the longest axis).
