The patient underwent a cosyntropin stimulation test. Prior to the test, the morning serum cortisol level was 11.1 ug/dL [306 nmol/L] (reference range: 2.5-19.5 ug/dL; 69-538 nmol/L) and ACTH level was 26.4 pg/mL [5.81 pmol/L] (reference range: 7.2-63.3 pg/mL; 1.59-13.9 pmol/L). The cosyntropin stimulation test revealed a serum cortisol level of 21.9 ug/dL [604 nmol/L] prior to cosyntropin administration and 26.1 ug/dL [720 nmol/L] 30 minutes following administration.
