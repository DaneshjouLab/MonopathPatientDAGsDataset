A 63-year-old male presented on September 29, 2023, with a 6-month history of intermittent hematochezia and a gradually increasing swelling in the anus for 3 months. A digital rectal exam revealed a hard, mobile mass 2 cm above the anus, measuring approximately 30 mm x 20 mm x 20 mm. The patient underwent thoracic CT imaging, which revealed a poorly defined irregular mass in the middle lobe of the right lung. Abdominal CT disclosed localized thickened intestinal wall with irregular calcification in the rectum near the anus. A puncture biopsy of the right lung mass was performed. Complete resection of the rectal mass was performed. Histology of the lung tumor revealed infiltrating small blue round or fusiform tumor cells with scant cytoplasm, pepper-salt-like nuclei and high nucleo-cytoplasmic ratio. Immunohistochemistry of the lung tumor showed tumor cells positive for AE1/AE3, TTF-1, synaptophysin (Syn), and chromogranin A. Ki-67 labeling index was up to 90%. High magnification (H&E, \u00d7400) indicated poorly differentiated small blue roundish or spindle cells with sparse cytoplasm and hyperchromatic stained pretzel-like nuclei. AE1/AE3 and TTF-1 were diffuse positive (SP\u2005\u00d7\u2005100).
