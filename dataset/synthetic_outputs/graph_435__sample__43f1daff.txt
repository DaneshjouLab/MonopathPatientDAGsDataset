A 75-year-old male presented with a 5-month history of recurrent coughing, expectoration, and panting, with symptoms worsening over the past month. Initially, the patient coughed up white frothy sputum. A chest CT scan revealed bilateral diffuse lesions and a nodular shadow in the left lower lobe. The patient was treated with intravenous piperacillin sulbactam (4.5g, Q8h), which resulted in symptom relief.

A follow-up chest CT on January 19, 2020, indicated a special infectious lesion and a nodular shadow in the back of the left lower lobe. A repeat chest CT on January 26, 2020, showed worsening opacity in both lungs, diffuse lesions in both lungs, scattered ground glass nodes in both lungs, and a nodular shadow in the posterior segment of the upper lobe of the left lung. The patient refused invasive tracheoscopy examination or biopsy.

A subsequent chest CT reexamination on April 24, 2020, indicated diffuse lesions of both lungs, a special pathological bacterial infection lesion, and scattered ground glass nodes with a withered shape in both lungs. Compared to the January 26, 2020, scan, the foci had increased significantly. A final chest CT reexamination on May 14, 2020, indicated diffuse lesions of both lungs and the special pathological bacterial infection lesion that needed to be checked. The nodular shadow in the posterior segment of the upper lobe of the left lung had absorbed slightly.
