A 59-year-old female with a past medical history significant for essential hypertension presented to the emergency department with new onset of seizures and abdominal pain. She had been diagnosed with Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) 11 months prior to presentation, during evaluation for seizures. She received six weeks of low-dose radiation with concomitant temozolomide (115mg/day oral daily), which was discontinued due to refractory pancytopenia. Bevacizumab treatment was started. Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody that works as a chimeric VEGF receptor, blocking VEGF and preventing it from binding to VEGFR.

The patient complained of significant abdominal pain the night before presentation. En route to the hospital, she experienced three seizure episodes, which were treated with benzodiazepines in the emergency room. Physical exam revealed abdominal tenderness with distention, rigidity, and guarding, alongside neurological findings. Labs showed low bicarbonate (19 mEq/L, normal range: 23-29 mEq/L) and mild elevation of high sensitivity troponin I (71 pg/mL, normal range: 0-12 pg/mL). A CT scan of the head showed the right frontal and temporal lobe masses with a stable subfalcine shift of 7.0 mm.

CT imaging of the abdomen revealed a large amount of retroperitoneal air, and some intraperitoneal air extending to the mediastinum. Distal colonic perforation with stool material outside of the colon in the pelvis and a sizable pelvic fluid collection was suspected. Colonic perforation was suspected to be at the descending colon/sigmoid colon junction, where the colon appeared somewhat thickened. No evidence of hemorrhage or obstructive hydrocephalus was found. An old CT scan of the abdomen showed a large diverticulum at the site of perforation. A current CT Scan Abdomen and Pelvis without contrast showed air in the peritoneum from Intestinal perforation.

A stat consultation with the surgical team was obtained, and the patient's condition was discussed with the patient's oncologist and husband. Comfort care was initiated per patient's wishes. Surgery was not considered due to the probability of poor wound healing.
