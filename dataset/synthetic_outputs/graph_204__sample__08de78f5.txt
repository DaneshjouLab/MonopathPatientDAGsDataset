A 68-year-old Hispanic male presented with a one-month history of a progressively enlarging and painful head mass and accompanying headaches. His past medical history was significant for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with a social history of 40-pack-year smoking. He denied nausea, seizures, loss of consciousness, cough, or shortness of breath.

A head CT scan performed two weeks prior revealed a 39 x 32 mm soft tissue mass located at the dorsal midline of the parietal-occipital bone.

Physical examination revealed the patient was vitally stable. A palpable, round, non-pulsatile, tender mass measuring 5 x 2 cm was present on the occipital area of the head. Laboratory testing, including complete blood count, renal function test, liver function test, and serum electrolyte levels, showed no abnormalities. A CT scan of the head without contrast revealed a 5 cm soft tissue mass located at the dorsal midline parietal-occipital bone.

CT head without contrast showed a 5.0 x 4.2 x 3.3 cm soft tissue mass centered within the dorsal midline parietal-occipital bone with extension into the epidural space and invasion of the superior sagittal sinus. Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) was negative. The patient was started on levetiracetam to prevent seizures and referred to neurosurgery.

MRI of the brain without contrast showed a lytic mass centered in the posterior midline parietal and occipital bone, measuring approximately 5.1 x 2.6 x 4.0 cm (craniocaudal by anteroposterior by transverse). The mass had eroded through the inner and outer tables of the skull, extending into the epidural space and overlying subcutaneous fat. The mass slightly compressed the underlying parietal and occipital cortex without associated vasogenic edema. CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with contrast revealed a lobulated solid mass measuring 4.8 x 4.2 x 4.6 cm in the right upper lobe of the lung, along with a lytic lesion and pathologic fracture on the posterior aspect of the right 7th rib, a 3 cm soft tissue mass over the right 11th rib, a small lytic lesion on the right iliac wing, and on the right sacral ala.

CT chest with contrast showed a 4.8 x 4.2 x 4.6 cm lobulated solid mass in the right upper lobe contiguous with the pulmonary hila and a lytic lesion posteriorly on the right 7th rib with pathologic fracture. CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast showed a small lytic lesion in the right iliac wing, and a 3.5 cm lytic lesion in the right sacral ala without fracture. MRI brain without contrast showed anterior displacement of the superior sagittal sinus, without evidence of sinus invasion, and a 5 cm lytic mass centered in the posterior midline parietal and occipital bone eroding through the inner and outer table with mild extension into the epidural space with mild mass effect on the parietal lobe. The patient was referred to interventional radiology for a biopsy of the skull mass.

The patient underwent occipital mass resection with wire mesh cranioplasty the day after the biopsy.

Immunohistology of the resected occipital mass revealed positive CK7 and CK 20 staining and negative TTF1 staining with PD-L1, suggesting a lung origin of metastatic adenocarcinoma.
