Physical examination showed left supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, about 1 cm in size. Chest CT revealed a 2 cm mass in the posterior basal segment of the left lower lobe, with multiple burrs on the edge and enhancement. Mediastinal lymph nodes were enlarged and fused, surrounding the left main bronchus. Abdominal enhanced CT showed enlargement of the left adrenal gland, considered to be a metastatic lesion. Emission computed tomograph (ECT) whole-body bone imaging and brain enhanced MRI showed no obvious abnormalities. Immunohistochemical (IHC) markers were CK-pan and P40 positive.",
