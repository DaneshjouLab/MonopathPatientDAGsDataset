A 58-year-old man presented with difficulty swallowing. One year prior to admission, the patient developed dysphagia when eating solid food, cough after drinking water, and belching. Five months prior to admission, gastroscopy revealed a tumor at the region of the cardia and gastric fundus. Biopsy showed signs of acute and chronic inflammation and active glandular hyperplasia at the gastric fundus. Eight weeks before admission, the patient's weight dropped 3 kg compared with that in the time of his last visit of the clinic. Gastroscopy found a tumor at the region of the cardia and gastric fundus. The patient was recommended another biopsy and transfer to the hospital for further treatment, but the patient did not comply and took omeprazole himself. The macroscopic appearance of the tumor suggested malignancy, but pathology results did not support cancer. The patient refused surgical exploration and requested to continue medical treatment and follow-up at the outpatient clinic. The patient was instructed to eat a liquid diet and take esomeprazole enteric-coated tablets (20 mg po bid), almagate (1.5 g po tid), and mosapride citrate (5 mg po tid). One week before admission, the patient experienced worsened dysphagia, with difficulty eating a liquid diet, accompanied by nausea and vomiting. Upon admission, the patient's weight was 40.5 kg, with a BMI of 15.5 kg/m2. The patient was scheduled for gastroscopy and enhanced CT again. A jejunal nutrition tube was placed using endoscopy. Cardiothoracic surgeons considered the patient had definite mechanical obstruction in the lower esophagus and operated on the patient.
