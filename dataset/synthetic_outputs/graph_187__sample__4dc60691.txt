A 42-year-old woman presented in early October 2020 with general malaise and anorexia lasting for 3 months and was admitted. She was diagnosed with advanced right upper lung cancer with multiple brain and bone metastases (Fig. 1Aâ€“E). The clinical stage of her cancer was T1bN3M1b, stage 4B. She developed severe anaemia (haemoglobin: 6.8 g/dL) and thrombocytopenia (4.2\u00d7104/\u03bcL). Coagulopathy was indicated by elevated fibrin degradation products (144.4 \u03bcg/mL) and D-dimer (33.5 \u03bcg/mL). Prothrombin time-international normalised ratio was 1.87. Carcinoembryonic antigen and ferritin were 7763 ng/mL and 4061 ng/mL, respectively. She received transfusion of erythrocytes and platelets, and infusion of thrombomodulin alfa. Following bronchoscopy, empirical cytotoxic chemotherapy with carboplatin and nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel was initiated. Histopathology revealed lung adenocarcinoma. In mid-October, she was transferred to another hospital to receive multidisciplinary cancer therapy. She received a transfusion of erythrocytes and platelets twice. Enhanced computed tomography revealed an asymptomatic pulmonary thromboembolism. Heparin administration was initiated.
