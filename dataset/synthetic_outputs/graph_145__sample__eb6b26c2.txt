A patient with a cancerous mass at the right lower pulmonary lobe invading the posterior mediastinum and involving the inferior pulmonary vein was initiated on pembrolizumab therapy. Three days after the first pembrolizumab administration, the patient experienced dyspnea, productive cough, myalgia, and night sweats. The patient became hypoxemic with an oxygen saturation of 75%, a heart rate of 120 bpm, a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and a temperature of 38Â°C. Chest CT revealed diffuse ground glass nodules associated with parenchymal opacities with air bronchogram at the inferior lung lobe in addition to disseminated thickening of the interlobular interstitium related to acute interstitial lung disease. Subsequent axial chest CT showed diffuse interstitial pneumopathy associated with decreased pulmonary mass, thickening of the interlobular interstitium with bronchial wall thickening, and ground glass opacities. The patient was started on intravenous and oral corticotherapy. Despite corticotherapy, the patient's clinical condition worsened with increasing fever. A further chest CT showed exacerbation of the pre-existing lesions, with the appearance of several ground-glass areas associated with septal thickening forming the crazy paving pattern. Bronchoscopy with broncho-alveolar lavage confirmed the diagnosis of pneumocystis pneumonia.
