A 71-year-old woman presented with sepsis as the first symptom, exhibiting high fever, low blood pressure, and high inflammation indicators. Computed tomography (CT) examination revealed mild inflammation of the lungs and no obvious abnormalities in the abdomen. Blood culture suggested Escherichia coli, Aeromonas hydrophila, and Aeromonas caviae infection. Antibiotic treatment significantly improved the patientâ€™s sepsis symptoms; however, her thrombocytopenia (TCP) could not be corrected despite repeated platelet transfusions. Many malignant cells were ultimately found following a bone marrow puncture smear, and further positron emission tomography/CT (PET/CT) examination confirmed that the malignant tumor in the ascending colon was accompanied by multiple metastases, including the liver and bones. Colon adenocarcinoma was confirmed by autopsy.
