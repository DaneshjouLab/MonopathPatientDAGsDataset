A 58-year-old man with follicular B-cell lymphoma presented with symptoms including shortness of breath on exertion, profuse sweating, unintentional weight loss, and abdominal pain. He went to an urgent care facility, where an abdominal radiograph documented the presence of a left lower quadrant mass, which prompted referral to his primary care physician for further workup. Computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed right hilar, mediastinal, abdominal, and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, bilateral pleural effusions, a liver mass, and a large soft-tissue mass (17×5.1 cm) infiltrating the small bowel mesentery. Analysis of pleural fluid obtained by thoracentesis was positive for high-grade B-cell lymphoma of follicle center origin. A baseline echocardiogram also was obtained and showed normal left and right ventricular volumes, preserved left and right ventricular function (with a left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] of approximately 60%), no valvular issues, and mild pericardial effusion. Before receiving any chemotherapeutic agents, the patient developed oliguria and acute respiratory distress secondary to tumor lysis syndrome. The patient was diagnosed with Lymphoma. In the 10 years preceding the cancer diagnosis, he lived within a half mile of a paper mill where wood processing was conducted. The day after completing the eighth R-CHOP cycle, the patient’s clinical condition progressively worsened. He developed acute decompensation of congestive heart failure.
