A 74-year-old female diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma was referred to the hospital with chest tightness and shortness of breath. She had been treated with osimertinib plus savolitinib. Chest CT showed interstitial changes in both lungs, leading to a diagnosis of drug-related interstitial lung disease. The patient was treated with glucocorticoids, anti-infection measures, and mechanical ventilation. At the 1-year follow-up visit, the patient's interstitial lung disease was relatively stable. However, the patient passed away due to tumor progression. This case reports the development of interstitial lung disease in a patient with advanced lung cancer who developed it during treatment with savolitinib after resistance to osimertinib. MET-TKI is a late-stage treatment for drug-resistant NSCLC that has been marketed in recent years, and interstitial lung disease may be a rare adverse reaction.
