A patient presented with synchronous tumors, including small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDL). The patient experienced intermittent hematochezia. Thoracic computed tomography (CT) and abdominal CT scans were performed. The DDL was located in the rectum. The DDL exhibited osteosarcomatous differentiation. The patient developed multiple SCLC metastases, including brain SCLC metastasis, which led to severe cerebral hemorrhage. The liposarcoma was further classified as well-differentiated liposarcoma (WDL). The patient's condition involved liposarcomas and lung cancers, representing a synchronous malignancy. The DDL showed osteosarcoma differentiation.
