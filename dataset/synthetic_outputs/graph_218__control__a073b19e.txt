A patient presented with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), an oncogenic addiction often associated with shorter survival. Biomarker analysis and next-generation sequencing (NGS) of tumor tissue genotyping revealed an activating mutation, specifically an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) DEL19 mutation. This made the patient a candidate for targeted therapies using tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).

The patient was initially treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting EGFR. However, the patient subsequently developed severe hepatocellular failure, complicated by thrombotic microangiopathy. This life-threatening hepatocellular failure necessitated discontinuation of the initial anti-cancer treatment.

Further investigation via computerized tomography (CT) scan revealed diffuse bilobar lesions in the liver, along with multiple suspicious diffuse hepatic lesions, sub-diaphragmatic lymphadenopathies, pleural effusion, diffuse bone, and pulmonary lesions. A liver biopsy was performed, with immunohistochemistry showing CK7+, CK20-, TTF1+, SATB2-, and GATA 3- staining, consistent with a mucus-secreting carcinoma of the bronchus (T1aN3M1c).

Due to the severe adverse event, salvage chemotherapy was initiated. The patient also experienced significant side effects including osteoporosis, severe asthenia, complete anorexia, nausea, epigastric pain, and painful hepatomegaly.

Given the EGFR DEL19 mutation, the patient was subsequently treated with osimertinib, a third-generation anti-EGFR TKI. Following treatment with osimertinib, the patient experienced a tumor morphologic partial response. Monitoring of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) levels showed a decrease in DEL19 mutation ctDNA levels. The patient's case highlights the importance of biomarker analysis, including EGFR (DEL19 and L858R) and JAK3 (EGFR amplification), in guiding treatment decisions for NSCLC, as well as the potential for severe adverse events like thrombotic microangiopathy associated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
