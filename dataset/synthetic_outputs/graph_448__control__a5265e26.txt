An 18-year-old female with a known case of bladder exstrophy and chronic urinary incontinence underwent bladder repair and bladder neck reconstruction in 2016 and 2018, respectively. Despite these multiple repairs, the patient still suffers from urinary incontinence and presented to the emergency department (ED) complaining of urinary retention, lower abdominal pain radiating to the flanks, and dysuria. Her urinalysis showed positive nitrates, traces of protein, moderate red blood cells (RBCs) and white blood cells (WBCs), and moderate blood; therefore, she was admitted with a case of urinary tract infection and was started on antibiotics intravenously for two weeks. Abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) was ordered to rule out hydronephrosis. A computed tomography was ordered for her to rule out hydronephrosis, and incidentally, ovarian cysts were discovered that were then bilaterally excised via laparotomy. Further evaluation via pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was needed to determine the origin of the cyst, which demonstrated non-complicated cystic lesions bilaterally, most likely to be peritoneal inclusion cysts, and also showed evidence of uterine duplication anomalies. In addition, colocutaneous fistula and pelvic collections developed post-operatively.
