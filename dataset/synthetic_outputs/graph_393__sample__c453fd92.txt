A 42-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital with a pulmonary shadow. Patient developed a pulmonary shadow, leading to further investigation via thoracic CT scan. Thoracic CT scan revealed two pulmonary lesions, 19.5 and 20.9 mm in size, located in the posterior basal segment of the left lower lobe and the superior segment of right lower lobe respectively, with no significant enlargement observed in the mediastinal lymph nodes. Following the CT scan, routine blood tests were performed to assess the patient's overall condition. Routine blood test showed white blood cell count was 5.46\u00d7109/L, which was normal, and the patient did not have any obvious positive symptoms or signs. Based on imaging findings, the patient underwent a CT-guided percutaneous left lung biopsy on January 9, 2019. Biopsy results revealed non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma with EGFR exon 21 L858R mutation. Following the pathology report, a PET/CT examination was performed to assess the extent of the disease. PET/CT examination (January 15, 2019): bilateral lung lesions highly likely to be tumors; no metastases found in other sites. Based on the diagnosis and PET/CT results, the patient was started on neoadjuvant gefitinib therapy. Patient received neoadjuvant gefitinib therapy for 8 weeks. After 8 weeks of gefitinib therapy, a thoracic CT scan was performed to evaluate the treatment response. Thoracic CT scan post-gefitinib: left lower lobe lesion reduced significantly (13 mm in size); right lung lesion showed no obvious change. Following the CT scan post-gefitinib, the patient underwent pre-surgical evaluations. Presurgical evaluations, including pulmonary function test and metastatic examination, were normal.
