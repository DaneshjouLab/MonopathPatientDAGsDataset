The patient, who had undergone lung cancer resection in 2016, presented at the hospital with a small, oval-bounded mass in the left adrenal gland. This mass was initially discovered during a routine follow-up CT examination. Over the next two years, the left adrenal gland mass increased in size from 1 cm to 3.5 cm (maximum cross section) based on CT imaging.

In 2018, an enhanced CT scan revealed that the left adrenal gland mass was significantly larger than in 2016 and displayed ring enhancement with unenhanced flocculent exudate around it, accompanied by thickened renal peritoneal fascia. The enhanced CT scan showed obvious ring enhancement of the left adrenal mass in the arterial and venous phases (axial, coronal, and sagittal views). An abdomen physical exam was unremarkable. Epinephrine, 24-hour urinary catecholamine, aldosterone and plasma cortisol levels were all within normal range.

A dual-phase enhanced CT scan further showed the mass displayed ring enhancement surrounded by unenhanced flocculent exudate. Based on these CT imaging findings and the patientâ€™s history of lung cancer, a diagnosis of adrenal metastases was made.

Consequently, the patient underwent retroperitoneal laparoscopic partial resection of the left adrenal gland under general anesthesia. Postoperative pathology, however, indicated left adrenal adipose tissue and hemangiomatous hyperplasia. This led to a revised diagnosis of adrenal angiomyolipoma.

Seven days post-resection, the patient recovered with no surgery-related complications and was discharged. At a three-month follow-up, the patient was alive and had experienced no recurrence after the operation.
