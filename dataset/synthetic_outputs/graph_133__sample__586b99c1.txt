A 63-year-old Caucasian female presented to the emergency department with 2 months of progressively worsening shortness of breath, loss of appetite, and weight loss (15 pounds). She also reported worsening fatigue limiting her ability to exercise, and also dyspnea with mild-moderate exertion. The patient denied any additional constitutional symptoms. Medical history notable for hypothyroidism secondary to Hashimoto thyroiditis and well-controlled essential hypertension.

The patient's BMI was 17.06 kg/m3. She had a negative colonoscopy 3 months prior. She reported intermittent social tobacco use (1–2 cigarettes at parties/social gatherings over 5 years in her early 30s), occasional alcohol use, and no illicit drug use. She described a healthy lifestyle with focus on healthy eating and outdoor bicycling.

One week before admission, the patient underwent primary care directed evaluation with a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) showing diffuse nodular opacities throughout the lungs bilaterally with areas of coalescence and no lymphovascular invasion. Family history was notable for type II diabetes mellitus and obesity. Differential included infectious versus inflammatory processes, interstitial lung disease, or lymphangitic carcinomatosis. The patient was considered high risk for fungal and atypical mycobacterial infections due to living in mid-west and thin body habitus.

Upon admission, the patient had a temperature of 37.6 °C, blood pressure of 138/92 mmHg, heart rate of 116, respiratory rate of 39, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Comprehensive metabolic panel showed sodium 134 mmol/L, lactic acid 2.0 mmol/L, alanine transaminase (ALT) 54 U/L, and alkaline phosphatase 140 U/L.

Procalcitonin was < 0.05 ng/mL, C-reactive protein (CRP) 5.3 mg/dL, sedimentation rate (ESR) 80 mm/h, white blood count 23.91 × 103/uL with 95% neutrophils. Urinalysis was negative. CT without contrast with calcium score (3 years prior) showed a calcium score of zero in all branches and a 7 mm nodule in the left lower lobe.

Admission day imaging included a Chest X-ray showing a right pneumothorax with a 3.2 cm pleural separation, prominent diffuse bilateral interstitial alveolar opacities. CT chest with and without contrast showed diffuse nodular opacities throughout the lungs with areas of coalescence, in addition to small bilateral pleural effusions. PET showed diffuse hypermetabolic interstitial and airspace abnormality of the lungs without lymphadenopathy (or distant lesions), in addition to right hydropneumothorax and left pleural effusion. Empiric antibiotics were started.

Respiratory film array was negative for SARS-CoV-2, urine streptococcus and legionella antigens, cryptosporidium, cytomegalovirus, histoplasma, aspergillus, herpes simplex virus, and clostridium difficile.

Bronchoscopy with right middle lung biopsy and bronchial washings showed lepidic predominant adenocarcinoma, interpreted as primary lesion without stromal or lymphovascular invasion.

Iatrogenic right apical pneumothorax was picked up on post procedure chest X-ray (CXR) showing a right pneumothorax with 3.2 cm pleural separation and prominent diffuse bilateral interstitial alveolar opacities. A 14 French right anterior chest tube was placed on suction.
