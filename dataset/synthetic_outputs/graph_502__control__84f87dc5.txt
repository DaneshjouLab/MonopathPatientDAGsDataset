A 64-year-old woman was referred to our hospital with complaints of dizziness and vomiting. She was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma with EGFR G719X mutation and multiple intraventricular metastases. Brain is one of the most common target organ of lung cancer metastasis, while descriptions of intraventricular carcinomatosis could hardly be found among previous cases. To date no cases from lung adenocarcinoma have been reported in the literature. Compared to brain parenchyma metastasis, intraventricular lesions would cause more severe symptoms which may be rapidly progressive. Target therapy with afatinib was initiated and the lesions in both lung and brain achieved good partial responses. This case report revealed a phenomenon of rare intraventricular metastasis from lung cancer, which should be carefully distinguished from primary ventricular tumors. Target therapy could become a potential option in such patients with non-drugresistant EGFR mutations. Up to 50% of pulmonary carcinoma patients would develop brain metastases throughout their clinical courses, and 10â€“25% of them have brain metastases at the time of initial diagnosis.
