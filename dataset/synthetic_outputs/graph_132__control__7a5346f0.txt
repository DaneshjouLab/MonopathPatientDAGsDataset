An 80-year-old man with non-small cell lung cancer developed IgG4-related retroperitoneal fibrosis after receiving treatment with nivolumab and ipilimumab (NI therapy). Eight months after NI therapy was initiated, the patient developed lower abdominal pain. Although the primary lung lesion maintained its reduced size on computed tomography, there was an increase in the soft tissue shadows intensity around the abdominal aorta, bladder, and seminal vesicles, suggesting retroperitoneal fibrosis. Blood tests showed elevated IgG4 levels. Computed tomography-guided biopsy of the retroperitoneum showed B cell-dominant lymphocyte infiltration consistent with IgG4-related retroperitoneal fibrosis and characteristic CD8-positive lymphocyte infiltration, suggestive of the involvement of cytotoxic T cells. Based on the clinical, imaging, and pathological findings, the patient was diagnosed with IgG4-related retroperitoneal fibrosis due to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). Immunotherapy discontinuation alone did not result in improvement; therefore, steroid therapy was initiated. Systemic steroid therapy was initiated, and imaging showed reduction in size of the retroperitoneal fibrosis. This case highlights that IgG4-related retroperitoneal fibrosis can occur as an immune-related adverse event when administering anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies for cancer immunotherapy. Early steroid therapy could be effective in controlling this immune-related adverse event.
