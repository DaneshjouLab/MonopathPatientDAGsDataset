The patient presented with right locus coeruleus, visceral inversion, sinusitis and bronchial dilatation. Initial presentation of right locus coeruleus, visceral inversion, sinusitis and bronchial dilatation led to further cardiac evaluation. Electrocardiography showed a right-sided heart. Electrocardiography showing a right-sided heart prompted further imaging with chest CT and 3D reconstruction of the ribs to evaluate lung and organ positioning. Chest CT + 3D reconstruction of the ribs revealed chronic inflammation of both lungs, multiple bronchiectasis in both lungs, nodules in the upper lobe of the right lung, a flaky high-density shadow in the right main bronchus, bilateral pleural thickening, localized calcification of the right pleura and a right-sided heart with transposition of thoracic and abdominal organs. Chest CT findings of chronic lung inflammation, bronchiectasis, nodules, pleural thickening, and organ transposition prompted further investigation of the paranasal sinuses. Paranasal sinus CT revealed right maxillary sinusitis, ethmoid sinus, nasal soft tissue shadow, polyps, deviated nasal septum, and bilateral middle and lower turbinate hypertrophy. Paranasal sinus CT findings of sinusitis, polyps, and turbinate hypertrophy led to bronchoscopy to evaluate the bronchial tubes. Bronchoscopy revealed normal bronchial tubes in the right lung. Normal bronchial tubes in the right lung led to further bronchoscopic evaluation of the left lung. Bronchoscopy revealed a polypoid neoplasm in the opening of the upper lobe of the left lung, incompletely obstructing the lumen and spreading along the middle segment to the opening of the middle and lower lobes of the left lung, with necrosis on the surface. Bronchoscopy revealing a polypoid neoplasm in the left lung prompted bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cytology. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cytology revealed cancer cells. H&E stain revealed heterogeneous epithelioid cells with dense cells, deeply stained nuclei and little cytoplasm. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cytology showing cancer cells led to immunohistochemistry to determine the type of cancer. Immunohistochemistry: CK7(+), CD56(+), TTF-1(+), Syn(+), CgA(-), NapsinA(-) and LCK(+). Diagnosis of small cell lung cancer confirmed. Diagnosis of small cell lung cancer prompted auxiliary examination for metastasis. Extrapulmonary auxiliary examination suggested bone metastasis. Extrapulmonary auxiliary examination suggesting bone metastasis led to a final diagnosis of extensive stage. Diagnosed with small cell lung cancer of the left lung (extensive stage) and Kartagener Syndrome (KS). ECOG performance status score of 1.
