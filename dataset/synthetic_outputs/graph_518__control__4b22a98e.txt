**Severe mesenteric ischemia with multiple organ failure in a patient previously treated with a humanized monoclonal antibody against programmed death receptor-1 (pembrolizumab), a case of pembrolizumab associated catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome?**

Immune checkpoint inhibitors are used in the treatment of different types of tumors including melanoma and non-small cell lung carcinoma. The use of these inhibitors is associated with a broad spectrum of immune-related adverse effects. This case report describes a 74-year-old male patient with advanced melanoma who was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with multiple organ failure due to suspected catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS) following treatment with pembrolizumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor.

The patient had been diagnosed with a superficial spreading melanoma on his back three years prior. The tumor had a Breslow thickness of 4.0 mm, and there were two positive sentinel nodes in both axillae. After surgical resection, disease progression occurred one year later, with increased size of lymph nodes in both axillae and retroperitoneal regions. There was also suspicion of a solitary lung metastasis in the left upper lobe. The patient was then referred to a tertiary center for escalation of treatment. Molecular testing revealed an NRAS tumor mutation but no BRAF tumor mutation.

The patient subsequently developed multiple organ failure affecting the lungs, gastrointestinal system, kidneys, and liver. Vascular thrombosis was confirmed by imaging (pulmonary embolism on computed tomographyâ€“thorax) and histopathological examination of the intestines. In combination with the presence of IgA anti-cardiolipin antibodies and initially IgM anti-cardiolipin antibodies, catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome was suspected. Despite treatment with plasmapheresis and corticosteroids, the patient died due to multiple organ failure.
