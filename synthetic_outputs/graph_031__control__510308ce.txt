A patient presented with symptoms of fatigue and weight loss. Initial investigations revealed a nodule in the right upper lobe of the lung, accompanied by ground glass opacity and lymphadenopathy. Further investigation led to a diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma. The patient also had a history of several pre-existing conditions, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidaemia, peptic ulcer disease, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, diverticulosis, and colonic polyps.

Interestingly, the patient was also diagnosed with Situs inversus, characterized by dextrocardia and other cardiac and vascular anomalies. Further investigation revealed chronic sinusitis and bronchiectasis, leading to a diagnosis of Kartagener syndrome. CT imaging revealed vascular variation.

The patient underwent video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) with a right upper lobectomy, specifically a trigsegmentectomy, to address the lung adenocarcinoma. Subsequently, a right lower lobe nodule wedge resection, specifically a right lower lobe superior segmentectomy, was performed. Lymph node involvement was noted. Robotic surgery techniques, guided by model-generating software and CT imaging, were utilized. Bronchoscopy was also performed.
