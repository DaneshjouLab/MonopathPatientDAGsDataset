A 52-year-old man presented in December 2022 with a two-month history of swelling and pain in the right testis. His medical history included hypertension, which was well-controlled. He reported no known exposure to asbestos.

A pre-admission CT scan revealed significant hydrocele of the right testicular tunica vaginalis, suggesting epididymitis. B-ultrasound confirmed a cyst in the right epididymis head and significant hydrocele in the right testicle. Tumor markers were within normal limits.

Based on these findings, the patient underwent right testicular sheath reversal and right testicular sheath lesion resection under general anesthesia.

Postoperative pathological microscopic observations revealed two distinct forms of cells, epithelial and sarcomatoid, with reciprocal migration between the two. The epithelial components were characterized by small tubular, papillary, and solid arrangements.

The pathology report described tumor cells that were cubic, flattened, or low-columnar in shape, with eosinophilic cytoplasm and round nuclei containing visible nucleoli. The sarcomas were comprised of spindle-shaped cell clusters arranged in bundles or mats with spindle-shaped nuclei and visible nucleoli. Immunohistochemical staining showed the following results: Calretinin(+), carcinoembryonic antigen(\u2212), cytokeratin (CK)5/6(+), D2-40(+), Wilms' tumor 1 (WT-1)(+), human bone marrow endothelial cell marker-1(+), Gata-3(+), vimentin(+),desmin+), Ki-67(10%+), CD15(\u2212), CD34(\u2212), and smooth muscle actin(+). The pathological diagnosis was biphasic mesothelioma.

The patient recovered well postoperatively and was discharged seven days after admission.

In March 2023, the patient was readmitted for right orchiectomy.

Postoperative pathology of the testicular (right) and partial scrotal resection specimens below the skin, testis, and epididymis revealed fibrous tissue hyperplasia, lymphocyte infiltration, and a large number of foreign body giant cell aggregates and line knot reactions.

Postoperative assessment revealed no definite tumor residue, consistent with changes after tumor resection. The spermatic margin was negative. The patient had a long history of hydrocele.

The patient recovered well after surgery and was closely followed up. He was followed up once, and no abnormalities were observed.
