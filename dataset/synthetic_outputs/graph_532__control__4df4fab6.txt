Radiotherapy has been shown to cause malfunction of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, and there are few studies of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators and radiotherapy. This report describes an unusual case of small cell lung cancer in a patient with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator in whom direct irradiation to the electrode and lead could not be avoided.

The case involves a 72-year-old Korean man with limited-stage small cell lung cancer. Prior to cancer diagnosis, the patient had undergone insertion of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) due to ventricular fibrillation. He subsequently received radiotherapy to the thorax, with a total dose of 60 Gy delivered in 30 fractions. Due to the location of the tumor, direct irradiation of the ICD lead and electrode was unavoidable. The mean and maximum doses to the ICD body were estimated to be 0.89 Gy and 2.23 Gy, respectively. The lead received a mean dose of 17.12 Gy and a maximum dose of 55.72 Gy, while the electrode received a mean dose of 1.81 Gy and a maximum dose of 7.10 Gy. The patient's ICD function was monitored daily during radiotherapy, and no changes in ICD function were observed. The patient tolerated the treatment well without severe complications. A computed tomography scan performed 4 weeks after radiotherapy showed a good response with regression of the tumor. More than 36 months after the end of treatment, the patient was alive with complete remission of the tumor and without any ICD dysfunction.
