Squamous cell lung carcinoma (LUSC) is a prevalent type of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), accounting for approximately 25% to 30% of all NSCLCs. Epidemiological investigations have shown that LUSC occurs more commonly in elderly men and is more strongly associated with smoking than any other type of NSCLC. The early symptoms of LUSC are mild and easy to ignore. At the time of diagnosis, most patients are already in the advanced stage of the disease and often present with distal metastasis, which results in a poor prognosis of advanced LUSC with a 5-year survival rate of only 6%. LUSC originates from squamous cells and has a high rate of metastasis and recurrence. The lack of effective genetic targets and specific therapies has resulted in a poor prognosis for patients with LUSC.

This case report concerns a patient who was admitted to the hospital with coughing and hemoptysis. A tumor was found in his lung, and lesions were initially controlled with standard treatment. However, the patient’s tumor re-occurred again shortly for which treatment was lacking. Without effective treatment methods, the disease was difficult to control.

Gastrointestinal metastasis of LUSC is a rare occurrence in clinical practice. Patients with gastrointestinal metastasis usually have worse overall survival and the process of diagnosis is more complicated than those with metastasis elsewhere. What’s more, there are no helpful guidelines for treating patients with a clinically confirmed diagnosis of gastrointestinal metastasis, which means the treatment method is limited. Our learnings from the case demonstrate that LUSC metastasizes to secondary lymphoid organs of the gastrointestinal tract, usually with a poor prognosis.
