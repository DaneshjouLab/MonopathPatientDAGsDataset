A 48-year-old male presented to Jinling Hospital in January 2023 with chest pain for 1 week. The chest pain was not localized, not associated with heartburn or chest pressure, not provoked by exertion, and not relieved by rest. The patient denied fever, dizziness, fainting, dyspnea, or coughing.

The patient had been diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 by real time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) testing in early December 2022, experiencing high-grade fever (38-39Â°C), cough, and sore throat for 4 days. He received symptomatic treatments at home, including cough suppressants and antipyretics, and recovered within 1 week.

The patient had a history of hypertension for 10 years and was receiving sustained-release felodipine tablets (5 mg/per day). He had no previous history of TB.

Physical examination revealed bilaterally soft and swollen cervical lymph nodes in bean size, but they were not painful. All other systemic examinations and vital signs were normal.

In January 2023, a 12-lead ECG, coronary arteriography, and echocardiography were performed, revealing no evidence of cardiovascular disease.

Serum markers were assessed: Creatine kinase 84 U/l (normal range, 50-310 U/l), MB isoenzyme of creatine kinase 1.7 ng/ml (normal range, 0-3.7 ng/ml), troponin T 0.009 ng/ml (normal range, 0-0.014 ng/ml), troponin I 0.03 ng/ml (normal range, <0.06 ng/ml).
