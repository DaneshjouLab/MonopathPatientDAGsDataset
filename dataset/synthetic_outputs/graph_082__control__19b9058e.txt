A patient with lung adenocarcinoma developed leptomeningeal metastases. The patient also had a somatic BRCA2 mutation and an EGFR mutation. The patient was treated with Olaparib and experienced a durable response. Mutations in BRCA1/2 are associated with a higher risk of ovarian, breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancer. PARP inhibitors have been approved for the treatment of ovarian and breast cancer. Studies focusing on the association between the BRCA gene and NSCLC, as well as the efficacy of PARP inhibitors in NSCLC, are scarce. This case report presents the case of a patient with lung adenocarcinoma and leptomeningeal metastases who experienced a durable response to Olaparib.
