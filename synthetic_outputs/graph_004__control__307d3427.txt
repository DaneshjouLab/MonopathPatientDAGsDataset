An 81-year-old female with no history of smoking or malignancy presented with a 10-day history of progressive chest tightness and dyspnea, which worsened with physical activity. Additional symptoms included cough and back pain. Chest computed tomography (CT) imaging revealed a large left-sided pleural effusion. Contrast-enhanced imaging demonstrated irregular enhancement patterns suggestive of a left lung tumor. Pulmonary window analysis identified multiple nodular high-density foci scattered across both lungs, raising suspicion for bilateral pulmonary metastases. Mediastinal window assessment further revealed bilateral mediastinal lymphadenopathy and enlarged lymph nodes at the left pulmonary hilum, consistent with lymph node metastasis. An abdominal CT scan detected multiple low-density hepatic nodules of varying sizes, with the largest lesion (2.9 cm × 2.6 cm) located in the right hepatic lobe. Annular enhancement was noted in the arterial phase, while marked hypodensity was observed in the portal venous phase, demonstrating a “bull’s eye sign” characteristic of multiple hepatic metastases. Additionally, an enhanced brain CT identified an irregular heterogeneously enhancing mass within the right frontal lobe, with a maximum cross-sectional area of 2.1 cm × 1.6 cm, consistent with brain metastasis. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining ruled out malignant mesothelioma, epithelioid sarcoma, plasmacytoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Based on the integration of IHC findings and morphological features, a pathologic diagnosis of INI-1-deficient undifferentiated carcinoma was established. Further analysis of the pleural effusion identified an EGFR 19del mutation. Correlating the imaging findings with the pathologic diagnosis, the clinical assessment confirmed metastatic INI-1-deficient undifferentiated carcinoma of the left lung, associated with malignant pleural effusion, bilateral pulmonary metastases, pleural involvement, multiple hepatic metastases, brain metastasis, and extensive mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
