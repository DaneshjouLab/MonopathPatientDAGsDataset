A 55-year-old woman with a prior history of breast cancer was diagnosed with Large Cell Neuroendocrine Carcinoma (LCNEC). Initially, she presented with multiple brain metastases (BMs) after undergoing surgery and adjuvant radiochemotherapy for the breast cancer.

Pathological examination of the initial breast cancer confirmed the presence of invasive ductal carcinoma in the left breast, classified as WHO grade III. Metastatic spread was detected in the left axillary lymph nodes (7 out of 18 sampled showing involvement) and in the left subclavian lymph nodes (1 out of 2 sampled exhibiting metastasis).

Later, the patient was readmitted to the hospital after a physical examination revealed nodules in the upper left lung. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest suggested a solid nodule in the upper lobe of the left lung, measuring approximately 3.3 × 2.4 cm. Histological analysis revealed a complex LCNEC, comprising 97% LCNEC and 3% invasive adenocarcinoma (vesicular and minor solid type). Lymphatic involvement was notable, with a substantial presence of cancer emboli detected in the pleura. Examination of lymph nodes revealed metastases in “group 5” (1 out of 1), “group 7” (1 out of 1), “group 10” (1 out of 1), and “group 12” (1 out of 1), along with involvement of peribronchial lymph nodes (2 out of 3).

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed multiple new BMs, with the largest lesion located in the left frontal region near the cerebral falx, measuring approximately 1.2 × 0.7 cm. After 6 weeks of treatment (likely lorlatinib, based on the outcome), there was a significant reduction in the tumor, and the treatment impact was evaluated as a partial response. The patient’s brain MRI showed partial disappearance and partial shrinkage of the intracranial nodules, with the left frontal parafoveal cerebral sickle nodule narrowing to 1.1 cm × 0.8 cm. Subsequent follow-up brain MRI in December 2023 revealed further shrinkage, with the left frontal lobe nodule measuring 0.6 × 0.4 cm and the right temporal lobe nodule nearly absent.
