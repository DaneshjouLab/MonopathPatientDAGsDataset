A 68-year-old man presented with an amelanotic choroidal lesion in the left eye concerning for choroidal metastasis. Systemic evaluation identified widely metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung with EGFR exon 19 mutation. The patient also had central nervous system metastases. He was treated with osimertinib, a third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor, as the first-line treatment. Within one month of initiating treatment with osimertinib, there was complete resolution of the subretinal fluid over the choroidal lesion and decreased thickness of the lesion. At follow-up after three months of treatment, the lesion was clinically involuted. Positron emission tomography at two months and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain at three months showed significant interval decrease in size and activity of the primary right lung lesion, central nervous system lesions, and other metastatic sites with no new metastatic lesions.
