An 84-year-old male with a history of stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), hypertension, dyslipidemia, mitral valve prolapse with a focal flail segment (portion of P2), and a smoking history of 40 pack-years (quit 20 years prior to the first encounter) was emergently admitted after three episodes of exertional dyspnea over a 1-month period had progressed to dyspnea occurring at rest. Worsening dyspnea prompted chest radiography, which revealed a large left pleural effusion. These findings led to a CT scan, which revealed a 3.5-cm anterior left upper lobe (LUL) consolidation and near-complete left lung atelectasis, with pleural effusion. CT scan findings prompted thoracentesis to evaluate the pleural effusion. A thoracentesis of 2,500 mL of pleural fluid was performed, and a sample sent for microbiologic and cytologic analysis. The fluid was exudative. Thoracentesis fluid was sent for analysis. Cultures were negative for acid-fast bacilli, fungi, and anaerobic organisms. Cytology was negative for malignant cells. Negative cultures and cytology results led to discharge with azithromycin for possible community-acquired pneumonia and instructions to return for follow-up with a pulmonologist. Follow-up with pulmonologist led to 18F-FDG PET-CT scan, which identified an FDG-avid LUL mass, mediastinal and bilateral hilar adenopathy, and an intracardiac focus of FDG avidity. PET-CT findings prompted further characterization of the intracardiac focus, revealing a 1.5-cm FDG-avid hypodense nodularity within the anterior papillary muscle, with a maximum standard uptake value of 112.3. The patient was also found to be hyponatremic, considered a paraneoplastic manifestation of the lung cancer.
