A 53-year-old male presented with exertional dyspnea and left shoulder pain for eight weeks. He had a history of smoking two packs a day between the ages of 14â€“40 years. The patient underwent a chest CT, which revealed a 36 mm mass in the left S3 area. A bronchoscopy was performed, and the patient was diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (squamous cell carcinoma) (cT2aN2M0, cStage IIIA). First-line chemotherapy with weekly carboplatin and paclitaxel plus radiation therapy (60 Gy) was initiated. After first-line chemotherapy plus radiation therapy, the patient developed Grade 1 radiation pulmonary inflammation (CTCAE 4.0). The patient then received 14 cycles of second-line chemotherapy with durvalumab. Progressive disease (PD) was observed, leading to a change in third-line chemotherapy to docetaxel. FDG-PET/CT showed increased primary tumor, left pleural effusion, and left subclavian lymphadenopathy. A biopsy of left subclavian lymphadenopathy confirmed metastasis of squamous cell carcinoma, indicating progressive disease (PD). The patient was hospitalized for fourth-line chemotherapy, with hospitalizations lasting 7-14 days followed by 7-14 days of discharge for each chemotherapy course. A chest X-ray showed extensive opacification in the left lung with massive pleural effusion indicated by chest CT.
