The patient, pre-morbidly, occasionally required crutches for mobility at home due to severe hip osteoarthritis, but otherwise he was independent with activities of daily living. In October 2021, the patient underwent palliative radiotherapy to the whole cervical spine (20 Gy in 5 fractions), right iliac crest and femur. Following radiotherapy, the patient received four cycles of carboplatin/pemetrexed with partial response in lungs and mediastinal lymph nodes and stable bone metastases. From February 2022, the patient commenced on maintenance pembrolizumab (200 mg every 3 weeks) and received seven cycles prior to symptom onset. Two months following initial presentation, the patient underwent a progress FDG-PET/CT which demonstrated increasing size and metabolic activity within at least two liver and multiple skeletal metastases, consistent with disease progression. The patient was then rechallenged with nivolumab monotherapy. Two months later, a progress FDG/PET demonstrated an increase in size and activity of multiple bone and liver metastases. Nivolumab was discontinued and the patient was referred to palliative care 6 months after initial presentation.
