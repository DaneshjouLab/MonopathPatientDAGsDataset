A patient presented with right ocular pain and blurred vision, which had started one month prior to presentation. The patient had visited his local doctor for these symptoms. Four months prior to this presentation, the patient had been diagnosed with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) (cT4N3M1c) with right cerebellar metastasis and invasion of the trachea and mediastinum. The patient underwent chemotherapy with four cycles of carboplatin/etoposide, followed by secondary chemotherapy with amrubicin. A slit-lamp examination of the right eye revealed corneal stromal edema. The anterior chamber contained 3+ cells and neovascularization of the iris at the pupillary border. The iris mass was presumed to be a metastasis from the SCLC, and neovascular glaucoma due to iris metastasis from the SCLC was suspected. Because of high IOP and pronounced nausea, intravenous administration of 200 mL of 20% hypertonic mannitol was required every 2â€“3 days, for a total of five administrations. The pathological findings from Papanicolaou staining were consistent with the results of bronchoalveolar lavage cytology, leading to a diagnosis of iris metastasis from SCLC. Despite therapy, IOP continued to be poorly controlled, and the patient continued to experience ocular pain. Five days after the aflibercept injection, the iris tumor had decreased in size, iris neovascularization had decreased, and the IOP was measured at 18 mm Hg. Intravenous infusion of hypertonic mannitol was no longer required, and ocular pain and nausea were relieved.
