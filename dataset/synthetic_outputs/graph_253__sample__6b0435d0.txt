A 68-year-old man presented with neck lymphadenopathy. His medical history included endoscopic resection of a colon polyp 1 year prior. He had a 48-year history of smoking two packs of cigarettes per day. His blood pressure was 148/91 mmHg and pulse rate was 111 bpm. He developed edema from the neck to the right shoulder and swelling of the right postauricular, cervical, and axillary lymph nodes. Chest CT revealed a tumor in the right upper lobe with hypertrophy of the bronchovascular bundles and lymphadenopathy at the hilar, mediastinal, supraclavicular, axillary, and cervical lymph nodes, predominantly on the right. The superior vena cava was slightly compressed but patent. Right cervical lymph node biopsy and sputum cytology revealed lung squamous cell carcinoma (cT2aN3M1c; programmed death ligand 1 tumor proportion score, 10%). The patient was treated with Cisplatin plus gemcitabine for six cycles. The primary lesion size was reduced, but lymphedema progressed, and papules appeared in the anterior and lateral chest wall. FDG-PET/CT revealed scattered FDG uptake in the skin around the papules. Skin biopsy indicated ZSM, judged as progressive disease. Pembrolizumab was administered as second-line chemotherapy for two cycles; cancerous lymphangiopathy worsened and the patient died 7 months after initial presentation. Autopsy and post-mortem biopsy of the skin and cervical lymph nodes indicated metastatic primary squamous cell lung carcinoma. Bilateral hilar lymph node metastasis, significantly larger on the right side, was observed. Lymphatic vessels near the subclavian vein and the lymphatic vessels inside the dermis near the papules were filled with tumor cells. FDG-PET/CT showed FDG uptake in skin metastasis, subclavicle and axillary lymph nodes. FDG uptake on the skin and subcutaneous tissue around papules at the level of the axilla and nipple was noted. 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) window width on PET appeared to be narrow to highlight the uptake in the subcutaneous tissue.
