In April 2015, a 27-year-old male presented with cough and phlegm and was diagnosed with left upper lung adenocarcinoma by biopsy, with a performance status score of 1. Simultaneously, positive ALK expression was detected by Ventana immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining. Crizotinib (250 mg, qd) was administered as adjuvant targeted therapy until an intracranial oligometastasis was first detected in July 2018, with a first progression-free survival (PFS 1) time of 39 months. Subsequently, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) of the intracranial oligometastasis followed by crizotinib treatment (250 mg, bid) was performed. Five months after SRS, the intracranial oligometastasis showed a complete response based on the RECIST 1.1 criteria.
