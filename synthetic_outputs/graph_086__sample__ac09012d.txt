In March 2022, a 36-year-old woman with no history of smoking presented to Anhui Chest Hospital with a 2-month history of cough and chest pain. A chest computed tomography (CT) on March 21, 2022, revealed left pleural thickening and pleural effusion. Thoracoscopic left pleural biopsy revealed stage IV lung adenocarcinoma. Plasma DNA analysis via next-generation sequencing (NGS) identified EGFR exon L858R (p.Leu858Arg) mutation. The patient received osimertinib as the first-line treatment. On May 22, 2022, a chest CT revealed a partial response (PR). By April 4, 2024, a chest CT revealed progressive disease (PD). Rebiopsy of the lung lesion and NGS revealed the originally identified EGFR L858R mutation and new BRAF V600E and TP53 mutations. The patient started treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib plus aumolertinib concurrently. On June 3, 2024, a chest CT compared to the previous CT (April 4, 2024) revealed a complete response (CR). The patient experienced a transient fever with a maximum temperature of 38.5 \u00b0C during treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib plus aumolertinib. The fever was determined to be an adverse reaction to drug therapy.
