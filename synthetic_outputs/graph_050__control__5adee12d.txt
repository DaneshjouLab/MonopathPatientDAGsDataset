**Case Report: SMARCA4-deficient NSCLC treated with first-line tislelizumab and fruquintinib achieved remarkable tumor regression**

SMARCA4-deficient non-small cell lung cancer (SMARCA4-dNSCLC) typically lacks target-driven gene alterations and is primarily resistant to cytotoxic drugs. There is currently no standard treatment.

This case reports a chemotherapy-free strategy with tislelizumab and fruquintinib utilized as a first-line treatment for a patient with SMARCA4-deficient NSCLC. The patient achieved remarkable partial remission and lasted more than two years of disease control without severe adverse events.

In February 2022, a 67-year-old man with ECOG PS 1 who had smoked 1 pack per day for 40 years presented to the hospital for chest tightness. Physical examination showed left supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, about 1 cm in size. Chest CT examination revealed a mass of about 2 cm in size in the posterior basal segment of the left lower lobe, with multiple burrs on the edge and enhancement. Multiple lymph nodes in the mediastinum were enlarged and fused, surrounding the left main bronchus. To further clarify the diagnosis, a CT-guided lung puncture biopsy was performed on March 10, 2022. Preliminary pathology suggested poorly differentiated carcinoma.
The patient was treated with first-line tislelizumab combined with fruquintinib. The patient achieved remarkable partial remission and lasted more than two years of disease control without severe adverse events. Unfortunately, cervical lymph node progression occurred. The patient was subsequently treated with a combination of local radiotherapy and previous systemic therapy.
