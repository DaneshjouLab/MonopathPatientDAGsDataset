A 67-year-old male with a 25-pack-year smoking history presented with left focal motor seizure and expressive aphasia. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated innumerable supra- and infrat. He was diagnosed with HER2-mutated non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with brain metastases (BMETS) and cerebral edema. The patient was treated with trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) to defer whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) because of the concern of long-term neurotoxicity. He initially also received bevacizumab to address the cerebral edema, which allowed stopping corticosteroids. After the first two doses, the patient had remarkable clinical and imaging (brain and systemic) responses without progression after more than 1 year of treatment. The patient was able to avoid radiation therapy, exhibit symptomatic improvement, and achieve durable CNS control.
