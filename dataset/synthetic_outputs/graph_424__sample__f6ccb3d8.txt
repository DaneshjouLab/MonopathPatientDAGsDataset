A 55-year-old male presented with a 3-month history of persistent cough and was referred to the hospital in June 2022. On June 30th, a CT scan of the chest revealed a solid mass in the right hilar lobe, accompanied by cancerous lymphadenitis and mediastinal lymph node metastasis, as well as pericardial and pleural involvement with large pericardial effusion and small right-sided pleural effusion. On July 6th, a puncture biopsy of the posterior segment of the right upper lung apex showed adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining showed TTF-1(+), P40(-), CK(+), CK5/6(-), Napsin-A(+), CK7(+), Syn(-), CgA(-), CD56(-). A diagnosis of moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma was established based on biopsy specimen H&E staining. Baseline enhanced CT scan showed tumors in the lungs before alectinib treatment. Tumor decreased significantly according to chest CT evaluation after 12 weeks and 24 weeks of alectinib treatment. IHC analyses indicated the tumor sections being positive for TTF-1 and ALK-D5F3, negative for P40. Representative H&E staining of tumor section showed adenocarcinoma cells.

Separately, a 47-year-old female patient presented. On April 18th, an enhanced CT scan revealed mediastinal lung cancer in the upper lobe of the left lung, with enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum and left hilum.
