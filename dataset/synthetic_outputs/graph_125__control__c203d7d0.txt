A 78-year-old man with a history of hypertension (managed with losartan and metoprolol), hyperlipidemia (managed with atorvastatin), diabetes mellitus (managed with glimepiride), and recent deep vein thrombosis (treated with apixaban) presented with symptoms suggestive of pneumonia.

Initially, the patient was diagnosed with pneumonia based on a chest radiograph showing right basilar opacity. He was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics. Physical examination revealed he was afebrile, respiratory rate of 16 breath per minute, heart rate of 90 beats per minute, oxygen saturation 96% on room air, and blood pressure of 132/75 mmHg. Chest examination revealed bilateral end-expiratory wheezes, and the neurological examination showed left upper and lower limb power was 3/5 as compared to 5/5 on the right side with no change from his baseline. Laboratory tests showed an elevated white blood cell count of 21.4 thousand cells per microliter with absolute neutrophils (83%). Electrocardiogram and arterial blood gas were within normal.

A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed an average left ventricle ejection fraction of 60% to 65% with grade 1 diastolic dysfunction and left ventricular hypertrophy with no significant valvular pathology. Blood cultures were positive for coagulase-negative staphylococci in one out of two bottles, leading to suspicion of infective endocarditis (IE). A trans-esophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was performed, which revealed poorly defined multiple subtle echo densities on the atrial side of the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve and on the ventricular side of the aortic valve mostly at the coaptation edges with no significant valvular damage suggestive of sterile vegetations. These findings were suggestive of Libman-Sacks endocarditis, which changed his diagnosis to lung cancer and nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE).
