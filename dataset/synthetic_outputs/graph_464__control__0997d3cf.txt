A patient with lung cancer, specifically adenocarcinoma, underwent curative chemoradiotherapy. Subsequently, the patient developed bone pain and was diagnosed with bone metastasis. Following this, the patient was treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). During or after ICI treatment, the patient experienced a series of adverse events, including immune-related liver injury, specifically ICI-related liver injury (also described as ICI‐related liver injury and ICI‐related hepatitis). Liver tests were repeatedly abnormal. The ICI-related liver injury led to cessation of treatment and hospitalization. In one instance, the patient also developed ICI-related pneumonitis. Ultimately, the patient experienced mortality.
