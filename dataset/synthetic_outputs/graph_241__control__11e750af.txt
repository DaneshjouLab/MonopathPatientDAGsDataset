**Introduction:** Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is encountered in about 8–15% of lung cancer patients at initial cancer diagnosis. The optimal therapeutic strategies for lung cancer with MPE remain unclear. Malignant pleural effusion is commonly encountered in about 8–15% of lung cancer patients at the time of initial cancer diagnosis, which has been categorized as stage IVa disease. The prognosis of lung cancer patients with MPE remains dismal with a median overall survival time of 5 months and a 5-year survival rate of 3%. Current guidelines recommended non-surgical therapy including local therapy (for example ambulatory small catheter drainage, pleurodesis, and pericardial window) with similar treatment strategies to other stage IV diseases consisting of systemic therapy and palliative therapy.

**Case Description:** This study reports a case of lung cancer with MPE, which was successfully managed with a multidisciplinary therapeutic strategy. The patient initially received gefitinib for 4 months with excellent response and underwent salvage thoracoscopic lobectomy and systematic lymphadenectomy. Pathological complete response was confirmed, and gefitinib was discontinued. The patient received 4 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy instead. The patient is still alive without disease progression for 62 months after surgery.

**Conclusions:** Combining targeted therapy, salvage surgery, and adjuvant therapy may be a promising treatment strategy for lung cancer with MPE harboring oncogene-targeted mutations.
