A 41-year-old male construction worker presented on October 21, 2021, with a 1-month history of cough without hemoptysis and with slight chest discomfort. An enhanced CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed a 4.5 cm x 5.6 cm tumor in the right middle lobe of the lung with metastasis to the right hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes, a 3.2 cm x 1 cm mass in the greater curvature of the stomach, and multiple lymph node metastases in the abdomen. PET-CT showed peripheral type lung cancer in the right middle lobe with multiple lymph node metastases in the mediastinum and right hilar region, lung metastasis in the left upper lobe, rib metastasis in the 9th rib on the left side, and obstructive inflammation and atelectasis in the right middle lobe of the lung. Bronchoscopy biopsy of the lung tumor showed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma in the inner side of the right middle lobe. Immunohistochemistry: CK7 (+), CK20 (-), CDX2 (-), TTF-1 (+), Napsin-A (+), CK5/6 (-), p63 (-), P40 (-), Ki-67 (80%+). Genetic testing showed no mutations or amplification in EGFR1, HER2, BRAF, ALK, KRAS, MET, NRAS, RET, TP53, ROS1, MAP2K1, PIK3CA, NTRK1, NTRK2, and NTRK3. Transbronchoscopic needle aspiration biopsy of lymph nodes in group 7 and 4R showed malignant tumor cells, suggesting non-small cell carcinoma. Gastric endoscopy pathology revealed adenocarcinoma in the gastric body, suspected to originate from lung adenocarcinoma based on immunohistochemistry and patient history. Immunohistochemistry staining results: TTF-1 (+), Napsin-A (+), CK7 (weakly positive), CDX2 (-), CK20 (-), Ki-67 (60%+).
