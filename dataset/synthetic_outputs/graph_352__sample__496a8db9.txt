In August 2018, a patient was diagnosed with poorly differentiated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and synchronous rectal adenocarcinoma. Immunotherapy with pembrolizumab (PEM) was initiated.

Following the diagnosis and initiation of immunotherapy, the patient progressively developed generalized arthralgias, asthenia, weight loss, several respiratory infections, functional deterioration (Barthel: 40, Lawton: 3), and cognitive decline with repeated falls.

Due to this progressive decline, the patient was admitted to a residential facility in October 2018.

In April 2019, after eleven treatment cycles, PEM administration was interrupted. However, PEM was reintroduced seven months later due to tumor progression.

The patient received fifteen sessions of thoracic and rectal radiotherapy. Frequent cycles of steroids were administered for generalized musculoskeletal pain, neck pain, arthritis, and tumor progression.

Four days after the administration of the fourteenth cycle of pembrolizumab, the patient was admitted to the Neurology service with acute global aphasia, confusion, sporadic myoclonus, and low-grade fever. The patient had recently finished levofloxacin treatment for pneumonia and was under dexamethasone treatment (8 mg/day) for 15 days.

A CT scan ruled out acute cerebral pathology. An EEG showed global slowing of electrical activity.
