A 41-year-old, never-smoker man was diagnosed with multiple metastatic lung adenocarcinoma harboring ALK gene rearrangements. After tumor re-growth was treated with alectinib, histological analysis of re-biopsy of the primary lesion showed combined small cell carcinoma, and cytotoxic chemotherapy was administered. After resistance to chemotherapy developed, the third biopsy of the primary lesion showed the original ALK gene rearrangements without the SCLC component. Alectinib was re-administered, and partial response was obtained.
