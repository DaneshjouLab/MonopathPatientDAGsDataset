After adenocarcinoma, squamous cell lung cancer is the most common type of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) among non-smokers. Diagnosis and staging of lung diseases, including adenocarcinoma, squamous cell lung cancer, and NSCLC, are best achieved through a tissue biopsy followed by imaging, including chest X-ray, computed tomography (CT) of the lung, and positron emission tomography (PET) scan.

Sometimes, the histopathological appearance of squamous cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) can be confused with organizing pneumonia. Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP), formerly known as bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), occurs secondary to injury to the alveolar wall and typically presents in the fifth or sixth decade of life, affecting both males and females in equal proportions. COP may mimic several different disease pathologies, including community-acquired pneumonia, idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIPs), and lung carcinoma.

Any lung mass that is highly suspicious for carcinoma should be closely monitored with imaging, and a repeat tissue biopsy should be done for a confirmation of the diagnosis to start appropriate therapy as soon as possible.
