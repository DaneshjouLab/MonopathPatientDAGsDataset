A 54-year-old Japanese man was referred to Nagara Medical Center after a ground glass opacity (GGO) lesion was incidentally detected on computed tomography within the right upper lung. The patient was diagnosed with a Solitary pulmonary capillary hemangioma (SPCH), a rare benign lung tumor that clinically resembles early lung cancer and precancerous pulmonary lesions that present with similar imaging manifestations. SPCH presents with a ground glass opacity on CT scan. Preoperative definitive diagnosis as SPCH is a real challenge. Immunohistochemical staining is essential for diagnosis.
