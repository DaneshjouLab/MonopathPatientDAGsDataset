A 58-year-old woman was incidentally found to have a left superior sulcus mass during evaluation for squamous cell carcinoma of the eyelid. Imaging studies revealed a 6 x 4.5 x 3.4 cm primary lung squamous cell carcinoma. The patient underwent 6 months of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. However, imaging studies showed progression of disease with mediastinal and anterior chest wall involvement. Consequently, the patient underwent open left upper lobectomy with en bloc first rib and partial sternal resection through a trapdoor incision. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 8. One week later, the patient returned with chest wound dehiscence, and cultures grew coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus. Treatment involved intravenous antibiotics and multiple surgical debridements followed by reconstruction of the chest wall defect with two rotational muscle flaps and a skin graft. Three months later, she had intermittent bleeding from an unhealed portion of the wound. A CTA of the thorax showed a pseudoaneurysm with a small focus of contrast material extravasation from the proximal innominate artery. The aneurysm was assumed to be mycotic, given the patient's history of wound infection.
