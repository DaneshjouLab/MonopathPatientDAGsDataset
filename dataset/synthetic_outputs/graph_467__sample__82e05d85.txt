A 46-year-old woman was diagnosed with locally advanced EGFRm NSCLC (exon19 mutation). She underwent lobectomy and lymph node dissection followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and thoracic radiation therapy. Surveillance brain MR imaging revealed no evidence of intracranial disease. One year later, the patient developed lung metastases and began gefitinib. Surveillance brain MR imaging was unremarkable. After 4 years of gefitinib, the patient developed headaches and was found to have 3 brain metastases treated with salvage stereotactic radiosurgery, including one in the right cerebellum. One year later, the patient developed mild headaches, and MR imaging revealed progression of the right cerebellar lesion consistent with FLIP. The patient underwent resection, revealing adenocarcinoma growing in a papillary pattern with large areas of necrosis and focal leptomeningeal involvement. Six months after resection, the lesion progressed again and was treated with fractionated radiation. The tumor recurred 6 months later, requiring a second resection. Three months following resection, brain MR imaging showed stable disease; however, symptomatically, she was severely fatigued, without an obvious cause. Six months later the patient died in the setting of palliative care.
