A 67-year-old patient was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma on May 18th, 2018. The patient initially presented with an elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of 23 ng/ml. Further investigation via prostate biopsy demonstrated adenocarcinoma with a Gleason score of 7 (4 + 3). Imaging was performed to assess the extent of the disease. Magnetic resonance imaging examination showed abnormal signals on both sides of the prostate. Further imaging to evaluate for metastasis was conducted, and a bone scan showed two bone metastatic lesions. Diagnosis and staging based on imaging results revealed a clinical stage of cT2N0M1b at diagnosis. The bone scan showed bone metastatic lesions in the left ilium and the 12th thoracic vertebra. The patient underwent bilateral orchidectomy on May 25th, 2018, followed by castrate levels of testosterone and antiandrogen treatment with bicalutamide tablets 50 mg daily. The patient underwent androgen deprivation therapy, followed by imaging to assess treatment response. A Ga-68 PSMA PET-CT showed multiple bone metastases lesions after 4 months of androgen deprivation therapy. The patient underwent six cycles of carboplatin chemotherapy, followed by imaging to assess treatment response. A bone scan showed one bone metastatic lesion in the left ilium after chemotherapy. Monitoring of PSA levels following treatment showed a PSA level decreased to 0.17 ng/ml on August 29th, 2018.
