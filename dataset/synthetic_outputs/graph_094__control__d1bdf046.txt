A 66-year-old woman without significant comorbidities was diagnosed with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the right lung including ipsilateral pleural and diffuse bone spread (T2N0M1c). Initial treatment with carboplatin/pemetrexed chemotherapy resulted in a partial remission after two cycles and was followed by pemetrexed maintenance. Two months after initiation of pemetrexed maintenance, the progression of the primary tumor and pleural effusion was noted by chest CT, and new cerebral metastases were detected by brain MRI. Second-line treatment with crizotinib (250 bid) was initiated, and the patient initially responded with tumor shrinkage of âˆ¼40%, as determined by radiological imaging. During the next disease progression with multiple new brain lesions 50 days later, the fusion VAF in retrospective analysis was 4.4% (i.e., lower than at the time of the previous systemic progression). After whole-brain radiotherapy with 30 Gy (10 fractions of 3 Gy), clinical and radiological follow-up during the following three months indicated stable disease, wherefore crizotinib treatment was continued. In accordance with the rising VAFs and protein levels, and despite the apparently stable radiologic findings, multilocular disease progression occurred just 1 month later, with multiple new lung and bone metastases as confirmed by PET-CT.
