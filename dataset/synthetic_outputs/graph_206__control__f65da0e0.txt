A 26-year-old nulliparous woman presented with deep dyspareunia, dyschezia, and occasional rectal bleeding. Examination revealed restricted uterine mobility and a rectovaginal nodule. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed multiple clear cystic structures in the pelvis of unknown aetiology. Following discussion by a multidisciplinary team, a diagnostic laparoscopy was performed. Intraoperatively, bilateral endometriomas were identified, along with multiple fluid-filled cystic structures in the pelvis and on the anterior abdominal wall. An adhesiolysis and drainage of endometriomas was performed, and the cystic structures were sent for histology. Histopathology confirmed Benign multicystic peritoneal mesothelioma (BMPM), positive for AE1/3 and calretinin. BMPM is a rare peritoneal tumour. The patient was referred to a mesothelioma malignancy institute and advised to undergo definitive surgery by the local endometriosis team. A joint surgical procedure with a colorectal team involved laparoscopic excision of peritoneal cysts, cystectomy for bilateral endometriomas, and excision of deep infiltrating endometriosis with bowel shaving. Histopathology revealed benign mesothelial cysts with foci of endometriosis. There are 7 documented cases of BMPM coexisting with endometriosis on histology and in the case reported here it was associated with deep infiltrating endometriosis. The patient had an uncomplicated recovery and is planned for long-term follow-up with the mesothelioma malignancy institute due to the high recurrence rate (up to 50 %).
