A 61-year-old female veteran with a history of hypertension presented with chronic cough, dyspnea, a 50-pound weight loss, and three weeks of nausea and vomiting. She was a non-smoker. Physical examination revealed cachexia, scleral icterus, jaundice, dry mucous membranes, decreased breath sounds in the left lower lung fields, tachycardia, and hypotension. Bowel sounds were normal without pain, distension, or organomegaly.

Initial laboratory results showed hyponatremia (sodium level of 131 mEq/L), a bicarbonate level of 32 mEq/L, an elevated alkaline phosphatase level of 215 u/L, a total bilirubin level of 5.8 mg/dL, an aspartate aminotransferase level of 58 u/L, and an alanine aminotransferase level of 36 u/L.

A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest revealed innumerable pulmonary parenchymal nodules throughout both lungs with a large peripherally located, 5.0 x 4.0 cm mass with a central area of necrosis and extensive involvement of the paratracheal and left hilar lymph nodes contiguous with the mass. The mass extended into the lingula as well as the superior segment of the left lower lobe with surrounding consolidation likely post-obstructive pneumonitis. A pleural effusion was also noted around the mass.

Abdominal ultrasonography revealed a severely dilated common bile duct and a moderately distended gall bladder.

Subsequent computed tomography (CT) revealed a large heterogeneous mass in the pancreatic head (approximately 4.5 cm), a grossly dilated common bile duct, enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes contiguous with the mass, and metastases to the brain.

Biopsies of the lung mass and pancreatic head were performed. Microscopic examination revealed cell clusters with high nuclear pleomorphism and prominent nuclei. Immunohistological staining was positive for thyroid transcription factorâˆ’1 (TTF-1) and cytokeratin-7 (CK-7), and negative for tumor protein 63 (p63). These findings suggested lung adenocarcinoma as the primary origin.
