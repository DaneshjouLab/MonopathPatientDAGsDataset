A 52-year-old man was diagnosed with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring the ROS1 fusion gene. The patient initially showed a poor response to conventional chemotherapy. Subsequently, the patient was treated with crizotinib and exhibited an exceptional and sustained response, with a progression-free survival of 94 months and complete metabolic response on PET scan.
