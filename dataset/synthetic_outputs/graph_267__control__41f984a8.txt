A 59-year-old male with a history of lung cancer with metastasis to the C3 lamina, who was previously independent in activities of daily living, presented to the emergency department with progressive quadriparesis and urinary dysfunction after farming work. An acute cervical epidural hematoma was initially diagnosed, and emergency surgery was subsequently performed. The spinal cord compression from this fluid collection was believed to be the cause of myelopathy, and the metastatic C3 lamina was completely removed to prevent recurrence. The case highlights that various conditions can cause myelopathy due to cervical epidural fluid collection, including idiopathic cervical epidural hematoma, traumatic cervical epidural hematoma, infectious myelitis, epidural abscess, spinal cord infarction, post-traumatic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage, and epidural tumors. This case specifically involved myelopathy caused by rapid accumulation of epidural exudate from a metastatic tumor in the cervical lamina.
