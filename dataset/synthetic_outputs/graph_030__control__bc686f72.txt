This case report series highlights the diagnostic challenge of differentiating lipoid pneumonia from primary lung cancer. Lipoid pneumonia is a rare inflammatory disease characterized by abnormal lipid deposition in the alveoli. It can manifest as pulmonary consolidation, mimicking primary lung cancer on radiological imaging, specifically computed tomography (CT), and showing increased uptake on fluorine-18-fluorodeoxy-D-glucose (FDG) positron-emission tomography (PET)/CT. The definitive diagnosis of lipoid pneumonia requires microscopic examination of cytological or histological samples. The case report series focuses on "Unmasking the mimic: lipoid pneumonia imitating primary lung cancer - a case report series of a diagnostic challenge".
