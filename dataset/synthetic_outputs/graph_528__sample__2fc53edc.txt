In 1997, a 42-year-old patient was admitted to the hospital with abdominal pain and subsequently diagnosed with colon cancer. On June 23, 1997, the patient underwent sigmoid colon cancer radical surgery. Postoperative histopathological analysis revealed sigmoid colon cancer graded as Dukes C1. The patient did not receive any chemotherapy or radiotherapy after the surgery.

In October 2003, the patient presented again with abdominal pain. A colonoscopy revealed ascending colon carcinoma, leading to a diagnosis of ascending colon carcinoma. On October 8, 2003, the patient underwent radial ascending colon carcinoma surgery. Histopathological analysis demonstrated moderately and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the ascending colon invading to the outer membrane. The patient was then treated with oral Carmofur 150 mg three times daily.

Later, the patient was diagnosed with urinary tract cancer.
