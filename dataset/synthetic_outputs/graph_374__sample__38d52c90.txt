A 59-year-old male presented on 2020-12-30 with haemoptysis. CT chest showed malignancy involving the inferior lobe of the left lung, confirmed on biopsy. EGFR status was negative. Family history was significant for lung cancer. The patient underwent surgical resection of the cancerous part of the lung and received 6 cycles of taxane and platinum-based chemotherapy. Four months post-surgery, the patient experienced dizziness, a syncopal attack, and tremors of the extremities. CT scan of the abdomen revealed metastases to the adrenal glands. CT head showed metastatic foci in the anterior part of the left frontal lobe and occipital lobe. Lung Cancer with Brain Metastases was treated with Radiotherapy followed by Bevacizumab Maintenance. Brain metastases were treated with radiotherapy followed by monthly bevacizumab maintenance-based chemotherapy. The patient's clinical status improved; dizziness and syncopal attack resolved. Follow-up CT scan of the head showed a decrease in vasogenic oedema compared to pre-intervention. CT scan of the brain after one year of treatment showed a marked decrease in vasogenic oedema and malignant changes. Clinical and radiological improvements were seen on bevacizumab maintenance.
