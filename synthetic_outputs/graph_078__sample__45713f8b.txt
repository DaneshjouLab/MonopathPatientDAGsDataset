In April 2021, a 61-year-old female was admitted for evaluation of chest tightness and cough. Physical examination revealed diminished breath sounds, and dry rales were heard in the right lower lung. The patient had grade 3 hypertension (very high risk), no other diseases, no family history of tumors, and no history of smoking. From initial presentation of chest tightness and cough with diminished breath sounds and dry rales, the patient underwent a chest CT. Chest CT revealed a mass in the lower lobe of the right lung with a distal obstructive lesion, measuring 83 mm in maximum diameter, suspected to be lung cancer. Following the discovery of a lung mass, further imaging revealed multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the right supraclavicular fossa, mediastinum, and right hilar region of the lung. Following the discovery of enlarged lymph nodes, the patient underwent a brain MRI. Brain MRI revealed brain metastasis in the left occipital lobe. Following the discovery of brain metastasis, tumor markers were assessed. Tumor markers were within normal range: SCC 1.830 ng/mL (normal range: <2.5 ng/mL), Pro-GRP 50.40 pg/mL (normal range: <74.4 pg/mL), CEA 3.180 ng/mL (normal range: <5.5 ng/mL), CYFRA21-1 2.150 ng/mL (normal range: <3.3 ng/mL), and NSE 8.530 ng/mL (normal range: 0â€“15 ng/mL). Following the tumor marker assessment, on April 15, 2021, an ultrasound-guided aspiration biopsy of a right cervical root lymph node was performed. Following the aspiration biopsy, postoperative pathology confirmed adenocarcinoma of the lower lobe of the right lung (T2N3M1).
