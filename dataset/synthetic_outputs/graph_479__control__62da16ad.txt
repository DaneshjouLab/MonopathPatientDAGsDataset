A 71-year-old man presented with a mass lesion in the left lung apex. A transbronchial lung biopsy was performed, revealing non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). He underwent left upper segmentectomy and lymph node dissection. Macroscopically, the mass showed a white-to-tan solid tumor on the cut surface. Microscopically, the tumor was composed of polygonal tumor cells which had round and vesicular nuclei with prominent nucleoli. Multifocal necrosis and hemorrhage were also noted. No lymph node metastasis was detected. Approximately four months after the segmentectomy, recurrence in the lumbar vertebrae was observed. Despite postoperative chemoradiotherapy, the patient died of cancer nine months after the surgery. Most lung carcinomas are subtyped by their morphologies; however, immunohistochemistry is usually performed when it is difficult to determine. The most reliable antibodies for distinguishing lung adenocarcinoma from squamous cell carcinoma are thyroid transcription factor‐1 (TTF‐1) and p40 (ΔNp63). In general, these markers are mutually exclusive in their expression of lung primary carcinoma; however, a few cases of non‐small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) with coexpression of both markers have been reported.
