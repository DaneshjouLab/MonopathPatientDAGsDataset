Case report: A patient with stage IIIB-N3 lung adenocarcinoma, characterized by a novel INTS10-ALK and EML4-ALK fusion, presented with N3 unresectable locally advanced disease. The patient was treated with neoadjuvant crizotinib for 5 months. Molecular pathologic analysis using next-generation sequencing (NGS) of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples, profiled with a capture-based targeted sequencing panel of 56 lung cancer-related genes, confirmed the dual ALK rearrangement. The patient achieved a complete pathologic response. The case highlights the potential benefits of neoadjuvant ALK-TKIs, specifically crizotinib, in N3 unresectable locally advanced lung adenocarcinoma with ALK fusion, even in the presence of novel rearrangements. The case was reported by the Lung Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.
