A 73-year-old male with lung cancer underwent bone scintigraphy for disease staging. Planar whole-body bone scintigraphy was performed in the anterior and posterior projections 3 hours after the injection of 740 MBq (20 mCi) of 99m technetium hydroxymethylene diphosphonate (99mTc-HMDP). Bone scintigraphy images incidentally demonstrated diffuse myocardial tracer uptake. Cardiac amyloidosis was suspected, although the patient had no symptoms at this time. Cardiac uptake on planar imaging at 3 hours was grade 3, indicating uptake greater than rib uptake with mild rib uptake. SPECT showed strong uptake in the ventricular septum. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) showed widespread subendocardial and partly transmural enhancement of the left ventricular myocardium on delayed postcontrast T1-weighted images. 18F-FDG PET/CT revealed tracer uptake (SUVmax=6.2) in the left ventricle wall. Cardiac ultrasound showed a dilated left atrium and left ventricle diastolic dysfunction. Ejection fraction estimated at 55%. Interventricular septum (IVS) and left ventricular posterior wall (LVPW) were slightly thicker (13 mm). No monoclonal protein was identified. Endomyocardial biopsy demonstrated diffuse amyloid deposition in the stroma of the myocardium with haematoxylin-eosin staining.
