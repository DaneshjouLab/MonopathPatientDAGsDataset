A 59-year-old male presented on December 30, 2020, with a chief complaint of haemoptysis. He denied fever, shortness of breath, recent weight loss, or weakness. A Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the chest revealed findings suggestive of malignancy involving the inferior lobe of the left lung, which was subsequently confirmed on biopsy as non-small cell lung cancer. Investigation for Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) status was negative. The patient had no significant past medical history, but his family history was significant for lung cancer in his uncle and grandfather (who died of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin), and his brother who died of colon carcinoma. The patient developed brain metastases. He was treated with radiotherapy followed by bevacizumab maintenance. This resulted in a remarkable response with marked clinical and radiological improvement along with a tolerable toxicity profile and prolonged survival.
