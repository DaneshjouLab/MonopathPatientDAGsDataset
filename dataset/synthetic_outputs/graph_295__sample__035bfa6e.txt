A woman in her late 60s with a 50 pack-year smoking history underwent lung cancer screening. The CT scan revealed a 1.9 cm tumor in the right middle lobe. The patient was asymptomatic, reporting no cough, weight loss, hemoptysis, chest pain, or shortness of breath. A CT-guided biopsy confirmed adenocarcinoma. The patient underwent a right middle lobectomy and lymph node dissection. The pathologic report revealed a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma (ADC) without lymph node or pleural involvement, staged as a pathologic T1b lesion, consistent with stage I lung cancer. The patient's medical history included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease, heart failure, anxiety, depression and prior non-Hodgkinâ€™s lymphoma treated with CHOP, radiation therapy, and stem cell rescue, resulting in long-term remission. Family history included breast and lung cancers. The patient was a chronic smoker and had occupational exposure to sandblasting and grinding dusts. Five years later, a follow-up CT scan revealed a new 1.6 cm subpleural nodule in the right upper lobe (RUL). PET imaging showed hypermetabolic activity in the RUL lesion and right hilar node. Navigational bronchoscopy and EBUS revealed two tumors: the RUL lesion and an incidental finding of endobronchial tissue obscuring the right lower lobe (RLL) superior subsegment. Pathology confirmed a poorly-differentiated small cell carcinoma.
