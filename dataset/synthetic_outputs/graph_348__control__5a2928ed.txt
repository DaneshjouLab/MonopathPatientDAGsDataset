A 39-year-old male patient presented with swelling on the left middle third of the face for 6 months. The patient was diagnosed with Small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (SNEC) of the oral cavity, a rare occurrence usually associated with lung cancer. The lesion presented as a nodular swelling over the buccal mucosa and was initially clinically diagnosed as a traumatic fibroma. Histopathological sections revealed diffuse sheets of round cells with granular chromatin. Immunohistochemical findings confirmed the final diagnosis of SNEC. SNECs are highly proliferative tumors characterized by early and widespread metastases through the vascular channels. The case is reported as the 12th SNEC of the oral cavity in English literature and the third case to be present on the buccal mucosa. The importance of diagnosis and appropriate management of these lesions is emphasized to decrease morbidity and mortality.
