In 2015, a patient underwent a right upper lobe lung resection with ilo-mediastinic lymph node dissection. Histo-pathological examination revealed an EGFR exon19 deletion mutated adenocarcinoma. The patient subsequently received four courses of adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin plus gemcitabine. In 2018, targeted therapy with osimertinib was started, resulting in a partial response according to RECIST criteria. On April 1, 2020, the patient was referred for acute onset of progressive shortness of breath and dry cough. Physical examination revealed moderate inspiratory retraction and diffuse inspiratory wheezing. Body temperature was 36.8 \u00b0C, heart rate 68 bpm, blood pressure 125/80 mm Hg, respiratory rate 25 per minute, and oxygen saturation 98% with 3 L/min oxygen supplement. ECOG PS was 2. Laboratory investigations showed normal LDH, CRP, and procalcitonin levels. Nasopharyngeal swab was negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR. CT scan of the thorax showed progressive disease in the superior mediastinum with significant reduction of the tracheal lumen. Palliative mediastinal radiotherapy was planned and methylprednisolone 40 mg bid was initiated. Chest CT scan showed a huge reduction of the trachea lumen (2 mm) due to mediastinal pathological tissue.
