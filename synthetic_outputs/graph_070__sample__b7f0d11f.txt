A female patient presented with memory problems one week after contracting COVID-19. Two days after noticing the memory issues, she underwent a lumpectomy. The pathology report revealed infiltrative breast carcinoma of mixed type (80% non-specific, 20% lobular), histoprognostic grade I (2-2-1), histological tumour size of 30 mm along the long axis, lymphocytic stromal infiltrate estimated at 10%, without endovascular carcinomatous emboli and no involvement of perineural sheaths. The report also showed ductal carcinoma in situ, intermediate grade, cribriform type, representing 10% of the total tumour surface. Immunohistochemistry showed oestrogen receptors (95%), progesterone receptors (80%), proliferation index (10%), and no HER2 overexpression (score 0). Right axillary sentinel lymph nodes showed no metastasis (0/5).

Based on these findings and the memory problems, the patient was diagnosed with anti-LGI1 limbic encephalitis associated with early-stage breast cancer. MRI, EEG, and positive anti-LGI1 antibodies supported the diagnosis of anti-LGI1 autoimmune encephalitis (AE). A PET scan was performed, identifying a breast tumour, which led to resection of the tumour with immunohistopathological analysis. The pathological stage (UICC, eighth edition 2017) was determined as pT2 N0 (sn) G1 R.

Immunosuppressive treatment was initiated within 24 hours of admission. A paraneoplastic neurological syndrome (PNS) care score was calculated, yielding a total score of 4, indicating a possible PNS.

The patient recovered gradually, experiencing no recurrence of headaches or focal epileptic seizures since hospitalization. Partial retrograde and anterograde amnesia persisted during the initial week, followed by a slow and steady improvement. Twelve months after discharge, the patient returned to work at 80% of her previous work hours.

Neuropsychological evaluation at baseline showed impairment in verbal episodic memory (Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test) and visual episodic memory (recall of the Reyâ€“Osterrieth complex figure). After 6 months of treatment, objective cognitive improvement was observed. A whole-body FDG-18 PET scan revealed a moderately hypermetabolic lesion in the right breast. Breast biopsy revealed non-specific (ductal) infiltrative breast carcinoma, histoprognostic grade (SBRm/Nottingham) grade II (3-2-1), without ductal carcinoma in situ. Immunohistochemistry showed oestrogen receptors (100%) and progesterone receptors (80%). The proliferation index was at 10%, and there was a low immunohistochemical overexpression of HER2 (score 1+). The patient relies heavily on family to validate memories, constantly questioning the accuracy of recollections. Sleep disturbances and a consistent weight loss of approximately one kilogram per week. Patient experiencing pervasive fatigue
