This clinical case report details the experience of 29 patients with glioma who contracted COVID-19. The cohort had a mean age of 48.0 years (range 23-73), with 15 (51.7%) males and 14 (48.3%) females. The majority (96.6%) had undergone resection, and 69% had received both radiation therapy and temozolomide. Bevacizumab was used in 34.5% of patients, and 6.9% had received Tumor Treating Fields (Optune). Obesity was present in 27.6% of patients, and 20.7% had a history of tobacco use.

The primary cancer types in the cohort were Astrocytoma (62.1%), Oligodendroglioma (24.1%), and Mesiotemporal angiocentric glioma (6.9%). One patient contracted COVID-19 twice. The median delay between glioma diagnosis and COVID-19 diagnosis was 59 months. At the time of COVID-19 diagnosis, 27.6% were taking dexamethasone, and 27.6% were undergoing cancer-specific treatment (2 on clinical trials, 2 receiving temozolomide, 2 on bevacizumab, 1 getting radiation therapy, and 1 undergoing resection).

Regarding vaccination status prior to COVID-19, 10 (34.5%) had received the Pfizer vaccine, 7 (24.1%) Moderna, and 1 (3.4%) Janssen. The number of vaccinations prior to COVID-19 was as follows: 0 vaccinations in 14 (48.3%), 1 vaccination in 1 (3.4%), 2 vaccinations in 3 (10.3%), and 3+ vaccinations in 11 (37.9%). The presumed COVID-19 variant was Original in 11 (37.9%), Epsilon in 1 (3.4%), Alpha in 2 (6.9%), and Omicron in 15 (51.7%).

COVID-19 symptoms included cough/sore throat/congestion (48.3%), fever (20.7%), shortness of breath/chest pain (20.7%), myalgia/fatigue (20.7%), loss of taste/smell (10.3%), headache (6.9%), and seizures (6.9%); 20.7% were asymptomatic. COVID-19 diagnosis delayed cancer-related care in 5 patients (17.2%). The majority (82.8%) did not require hospital admission. 5 patients were admitted, and 2 received COVID-19-directed treatment (remdesivir in both cases, dexamethasone in one case).

Among the 5 admitted patients, 1 had received 3 COVID-19 vaccines, 4 were not vaccinated, 2 were taking dexamethasone, 3 were not receiving dexamethasone, and none were receiving cancer-directed treatment. In the cohort, 55% had a Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) that remained the same or improved after contracting COVID-19, whereas KPS worsened in 20.7%.

By July 13, 2022, 5 patients (17.2%) had died from reasons unrelated to COVID-19 or its complications.

The hospitalization rate was 17.2%. Only 6.9% of patients qualified for and received COVID-19-specific treatment during admission. By the end of the analysis, all but 1 patient had eventually become vaccinated. The COVID-19 reinfection rate was 1 patient (3.4%).
