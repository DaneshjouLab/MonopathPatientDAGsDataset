A 53-year-old male was diagnosed with stage IIIa adenocarcinoma in the right lung in 2014 and underwent surgery. In 2018, brain metastases (BM) were observed in the head, indicating progression of the lung adenocarcinoma. In September 2018, the patient experienced dizziness and headache. A brain MRI revealed a 4.5 cm lesion in the right parietal lobe, with observed left ventricle deformation under compression and the center line deviated to the right. The patient was then treated with Crizotinib for 18 months. In April 2020, the patient experienced a sudden aggravation of dizziness and headache, along with limb weakness and difficulty walking. An MRI examination indicated a target lesion in the parietal lobe at the size of 5.1 × 4.1 cm, with obvious edema in the surrounding cerebral parenchyma. Alectinib was then used as treatment. However, a July 2020 MRI scan revealed the target lesion of the larger section in the parietal lobe was 5.3 × 4.6 cm in size. In July 2020, the patient requested Chinese medicine as monotherapy for long-term treatment. The prescription included: Radix Rehmanniae Praeparata 15 g, Rhizoma Dioscorea 15 g, Rhizoma Arisaematis 9 g, Bombyx Batryticatus 15 g, Coptis Chinensis 6 g, Fermentum Rubrum 12 g, Semen Sinapis 10 g, Fructus Lycii 15 g, Cyathula Officinalis 1.
