A 69-year-old man underwent a right nephrectomy in September 2017 for right renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The tumor measured 8.0 x 7.0 x 7.0 cm and was classified as clinical stage 3, clear cell type histology, grade 2. Histologically, the tumor was solid, with hemorrhage, necrosis, scarring, and pseudocapsule formation, and infiltrated into the renal parenchyma. The tumor spread to the right renal vein, but no infiltration into the inferior vena cava was observed. The patient also had localized right pleural metastases.

Post-nephrectomy, the patient did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy and was asymptomatic, undergoing regular follow-up CT scans of the chest and abdomen every three months.

In March 2020, the patient presented with right chest pain and dyspnea. A CT scan revealed right pleural effusion and multiple pleural masses. No abnormal radiologic findings were noted in other organs. Two pleural effusion tests were performed before surgery, both with cytological results of class I (negative for malignant cells).

One month after the initial presentation, a follow-up CT confirmed that the tumors had grown, despite no new abnormal radiologic findings elsewhere.

Thoracoscopy revealed multiple reddish, soft, bleeding encapsulated tumors in the intrathoracic region. Intrathoracic tumor resection was performed under general anesthesia. Histological diagnosis confirmed pleural metastasis from clear cell type RCC. Pleural fluid cytology showed no malignant cells. Eight bleeding tumors were completely resected, with the largest measuring 5.0 x 3.8 x 2.2 cm.

The patient is currently being treated with pembrolizumab plus axitinib. Non-enhanced CT shows multiple right pleural tumors with pleural effusion.
