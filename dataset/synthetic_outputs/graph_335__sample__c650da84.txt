A 65-year-old male was diagnosed in June 2019 with pancreatic cancer, a cancerous lesion in the liver, and an independent tumor with pneumothorax in the lower lobe of the right lung. Biopsy of the pancreas revealed primary adenocarcinoma. Biopsy of the liver lesion revealed metastatic adenocarcinoma from the pancreatic cancer. Partial resection of the lower lobe of the right lung was performed. Histopathological examination of the right lung revealed two tumors: one measuring 43 x 20 mm and another measuring 45 x 27 x 15 mm. The larger tumor was identified as invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the nonkeratinizing type, classified as primary lung cancer pT2b. Metastatic adenocarcinoma was detected in a small artery of the lung, positive for CK7, MUC1 and MUC5AC. Immunohistopathological staining pattern was the same as that of the primary pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Small adenocarcinomatous lesions were detected in the lung lesion, located outside the pleural elastic fibers. Metastatic adenocarcinoma was found in the fibrotic regions associated with pneumothorax and bronchiolization, adjacent to the lung cancer. Adenocarcinoma was detected in the intima of small arteries in the lung. Pulmonary fibrotic regions associated with pneumothorax and bronchiolization included metastatic lesions with abundant Î±SMA-positive myofibroblasts, similar to the cancer stroma. The patient died 50 days after the surgery.
