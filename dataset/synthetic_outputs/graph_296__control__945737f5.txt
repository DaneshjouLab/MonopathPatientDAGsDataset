A patient with lung cancer developed deep vein thrombosis (DVT), also known as venous thromboembolism (VTE). The patient underwent chemotherapy for the lung cancer. Despite treatment, the patient developed recurrent DVT. Management included aspirin, warfarin, and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) as anticoagulant therapy. Thrombolytic therapy and amputation were considered or performed. The patient subsequently developed pulmonary embolism (PE), a form of VTE. The lung cancer was characterized by malignant lesions, multiple lymph node metastases, and multiple cysts, indicating advanced disease. Palliative radiotherapy was administered to manage metastasis.
