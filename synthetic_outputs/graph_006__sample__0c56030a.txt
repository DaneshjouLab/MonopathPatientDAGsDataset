In June 2014, a 54-year-old man, an ex-smoker with a 60 pack-year history and a history of colitis, presented with right hip pain for two months. A CT scan revealed a ~25-mm nodule in the right upper lobe of the lung and a 50-mm mass in the right pelvic region. Subsequent 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-CT showed intense accumulation in the right S2 nodule of the lung, with a standardized uptake value (SUV) max of 15.2 in the right adrenal gland, and a pelvic mass from the right sciatic/pubic bone to the right internal obturator muscle (SUV max: 10.81). Histopathological examination of the transbronchial biopsy (TBB) specimen from the nodule in the right lung identified carcinoma with neuroendocrine features; hematoxylin and eosin staining showed small tumor cells with a relatively high nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio and hyperchromatic nuclei. Immunohistochemical analysis was positive for synaptophysin, napsin A, Ki-67 (30% positive), and thyroid transcription factor-1, and negative for p63 and chromogranin A. The patient was classified as having stage IV lung cancer (T1bN0M1b). Mutation status was negative for epidermal growth factor receptor and anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene, and the programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) tumor proportion score using the 22C3 antibody was less than 1%.
