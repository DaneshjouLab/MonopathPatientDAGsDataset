A 55-year-old male with a medical history of nephrolithiasis presented with lower urinary tract symptoms and hematuria. A CT scan revealed a 6.4 x 7.0 x 6.7 cm fungating mass arising from the floor of the bladder and involving the ureterovesical junction bilaterally, resulting in hydronephrosis and likely muscle invasion, but no evidence of regional or distant metastatic disease. He underwent transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT), which showed pT1 high grade urothelial carcinoma. Subsequently, he underwent a radical cystectomy with ileal conduit. Final pathology confirmed the initial TURBT pathology: high grade pT1 urothelial carcinoma, with lymphovascular invasion, no lymph node involvement, and negative resection margins. Incidental Gleason 3 + 3 = 6 prostatic adenocarcinoma was also detected. He remained disease-free until 4 years later, when he re-presented with right-sided flank pain. New findings included a 4.6 x 4.3 cm left adrenal gland mass, a 4.7 cm mass in the right middle lobe of the lung, two liver lesions, a 5.7 x 4.0 x 3.5 cm soft tissue mass at L1 with impingement of the spinal cord, and widespread bony metastases.
