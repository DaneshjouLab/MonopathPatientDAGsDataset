A 71-year-old female with a 3-year history of hypertension, managed with oral valsartan capsules, presented with sepsis and fever (peak temperature of 39 Â°C) accompanied by chills 3 hours prior to admission. She denied cough, expectoration, pharyngeal pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, increased urination frequency, increased urination urgency, or perianal pain.

Further investigation with CT abdomen revealed a 3 x 4 cm soft tissue mass in the right ascending colon. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET showed significantly high uptake of 18F-FDG in the right ascending colon mass, with SUVMax=8, and high signals in the ascending colon and left radius. The patient also presented with thrombocytopenia (TCP) due to bone marrow metastasis. Surgery and endoscopy were contraindicated.

The patient received conservative medical treatment including anti-inflammatory therapy with meropenem (0.5 g intravenously every 6 h), intravenous human immunoglobulin (5 g daily), erythrocyte suspension (4 units), and platelets (10 units). Insulin micropumps were continuously used to control blood glucose levels.

The final diagnosis was ascending colon malignant tumor. Despite medical treatment, the tumor progressed, and the patient died 3 weeks later.
