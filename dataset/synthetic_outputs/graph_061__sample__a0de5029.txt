A 65-year-old woman presented with dyspnea. Initial presentation led to further investigation, including a bronchoscopic biopsy of the right upper lobe, which showed adenocarcinoma. Biopsy results and further imaging revealed multiple bone and brain metastases, leading to a diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma (cT4N2M1c, stage IVB). Molecular profiling was performed to guide treatment decisions. No driver gene mutations or rearrangements were detected, but the programmed death–ligand 1 tumor proportion score was 60%. Based on the tumor proportion score, the patient was started on palliative radiation for spinal and brain metastases and first-line chemotherapy with cisplatin, pemetrexed, and pembrolizumab. After 13 cycles of chemotherapy, imaging revealed ascites and progressive disease. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed ascites, confirmed as adenocarcinoma by cytological analysis. Due to disease progression, docetaxel and ramucirumab (DTX + RAM) were introduced as second-line therapy. Despite second-line therapy, the patient's condition continued to decline. Ascites worsened, necessitating frequent abdominal paracentesis, and activities of daily living (ADL) declined. Performance status (PS) was 1, and her abdomen was markedly distended (91 cm). Blood tests showed hypoalbuminemia (albumin 3.4 g/dL).
