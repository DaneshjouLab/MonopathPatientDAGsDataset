A 68-year-old man with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) developed myelitis after T12-L2 vertebral radiotherapy, with motor deficit and sphincter dysfunction, while on treatment with pembrolizumab (an immune checkpoint inhibitor). The spinal abnormalities detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), suggestive of myelitis, faithfully matched the area previously irradiated with 30 Gy in 10 fractions, six and a half months earlier. After immunotherapy discontinuation and steroid treatment, the patient rapidly and completely recovered. On progression, pembrolizumab was rechallenged and, after 8 cycles, the patient is on response and there are no signs of myelitis relapse. Separately, a 68-year-old man without significant past medical history was diagnosed with advanced lung adenocarcinoma (KRAS mutated) with synchronous hepatic, pulmonary, and bone metastases and painful L1 spinal epiduritis.
