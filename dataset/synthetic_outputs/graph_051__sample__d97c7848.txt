A 65-year-old male with a 20-year history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was admitted to the hospital with sudden massive hemoptysis. The patient denied experiencing chest pain, dyspnea, or fever. He had no other significant comorbidities such as vascular diseases and was not receiving any other chronic therapies at the time of presentation. Two months prior to admission, an enhanced CT scan revealed a tumor in the right upper lung. A biopsy confirmed right upper lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), TNM stage T2bNXM1c1. The patient received two cycles of albumin-bound paclitaxel, nedaplatin, and tislelizumab. A follow-up CT scan showed partial remission of the tumor with cavitation. Upon admission for hemoptysis, physical examination revealed stable hemodynamics, no dyspnea but hemoptysis with an oxygen saturation of 93%, a blood pressure of 132/67 mmHg, and a heart rate of 88 bpm. The patient experienced approximately 200 mL of blood loss. Auscultation revealed a few wet rales in the upper right lung. Laboratory tests showed hemoglobin at 78 g/L, white blood cell count at 13.46 x 10^9/L, neutrophil percentage at 87.9%, and C-reactive protein at 143.0 mg/L. Coagulation tests indicated a slightly prolonged prothrombin time (PT) of 13.5 s, a normal thrombin time (TT) of 15.7 s, an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.17, a PT activity of 67.6%, and an activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) of 29.4 s. Plasma fibrinogen was elevated at 6.15 g/L, and D-dimer was at the upper normal limit of 0.55 mg/L. Emergency CTA revealed pseudoaneurysm formation in the right upper pulmonary artery located at the SCC cavity wall with an intraluminal hematoma. The bronchial and non-bronchial systemic arteries showed no significant dilation. The patient underwent emergency endovascular intervention. A 5F sheath was inserted via the right femoral vein. A 5F single-curve catheter was advanced to the opening of the right upper pulmonary artery. A 2.1F microcatheter was inserted into the pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysm (PAP). Embolization was performed using microcoils (one with 4-mm diameter and 14-cm length, two with 3-mm diameter and 3-cm length) to occlude the PAP and proximal artery. Post-procedure angiography confirmed the disappearance of the pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysm (PAP). The patient experienced no active bleeding postoperatively, and follow-up over 6 months showed no recurrence of hemoptysis. A CT scan 3 months post-embolization showed absorption of the tumor cavity with significant tumor reduction.
