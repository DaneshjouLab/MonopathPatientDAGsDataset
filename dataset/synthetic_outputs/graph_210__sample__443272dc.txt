In September 2019, a 62-year-old Chinese man presented with a 2-month history of cough with phlegm and blood in the phlegm. The patient underwent a chest CT scan, which revealed a mass at the right lower lobe, multiple nodular thickening with right horizontal fissures, and local atelectasis in the middle and lower lobes of the right lung. The scan also showed bilateral pleural effusion and inflammatory lesions (more severe on the right side), and plump mediastinal lymph-nodes. No metastatic lesions were detected. A CT-guided biopsy of the lung tumor tissue was performed. The biopsy revealed NSCLC, stage IVA (cT3N2M1a). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed positive expression for napsin A, Ki-67, thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1), and negative expression for P40, indicating an adenocarcinoma origin of the lung tumor. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining of the biopsy specimen showed a poorly differentiated tumor tissue. DNA-level NGS was performed on the biopsy specimen based on a 10-gene panel (including ALK, BRAF, EGFR, ERBB2, KRAS, MET, PIK3CA, RET, ROS1 and TP53). A novel solute carrier family 8 member A1 (SLC8A1)-ALK fusion type was identified with a mutant allele frequency of 5.98%. RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing confirmed the expression of a BCL11A-ALK fusion on RNA levels, where BCL11A exon 3 rearranged with ALK exon 20. This fusion retained the N-terminal part of BCL11A and the entire kinase domain of ALK. DNA-level analysis revealed a fusion of partial SLC8A1 exon 2 with the last 54 bp of ALK exon 19, and a fusion of partial BCL11A exon 3 with the first 1 bp of ALK exon 20. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) confirmed ALK rearrangement events on a chromosomal level in the biopsy specimen, showing typical positive ALK-rearrangement signals. No EGFR, TP53 and KRAS mutations or ROS1 rearrangement detected. FISH analysis showed fused red-green signals (negative signal), split red-green signals (positive signal) and single red signals (positive signal) in the patientâ€™s biopsy specimen.
