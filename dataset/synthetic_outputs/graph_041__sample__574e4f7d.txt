**Clinical Case Report**

In April 2021, a patient presented with recurrent lower abdominal pain that had persisted for 6 months. Initial gastrointestinal color Doppler ultrasound and abdominal CT at an external hospital suggested a space-occupying lesion in the small intestine, raising suspicion for a potential malignant tumor. Further investigation with contrast-enhanced abdominal CT at a tertiary (3A) hospital in Chongqing revealed thickening of the small intestinal wall in the left mid-to-lower abdomen, accompanied by mass formation and multiple surrounding lesions. This was suggestive of small intestinal malignancy with lymph node metastasis and possible pelvic peritoneal involvement. The patient reported no respiratory symptoms such as cough, sputum production, or shortness of breath. However, a comprehensive chest CT identified a space-occupying lesion in the apical-posterior segment of the left upper lobe, highly indicative of lung cancer, with enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes (stations 5 and 10L), suggesting potential metastasis. To confirm the diagnoses, needle biopsies were performed on the lung, mediastinal lymph nodes, and the small intestinal mass. All three lesions demonstrated features of high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma, with suspected small-cell carcinoma based on morphological and immunohistochemical (IHC) findings.
