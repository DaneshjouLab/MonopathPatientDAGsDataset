A 40-year-old woman presented with a suspected lung cancer lesion (c-T1cN0M0). Initial computed tomography (CT) revealed a 22 mm solid pulmonary nodule in the right lower lobe. In November 2010, she underwent a right lower lobectomy with systematic lymph node dissection. Postoperative pathology confirmed stage IIB (pT1cN1M0) moderately differentiated acinar adenocarcinoma. Immune-histochemical analysis indicated that the tumor cells were positive for ALK antibody (+ focal staining). She was treated with 4 cycles of cisplatin (80 mg/m2) and vinorelbine (25 mg/m2) combination as postoperative adjuvant therapy until March 2011. In October 2012, a PET scan revealed multiple lymph node metastases in the right supraclavicular region, bilateral lung hilus and mediastinum due to right supraclavicular lymph node swelling. Bilateral malignant pleural effusion, and carcinomatous lymphangioma in the left lower lobe were detected. EML4-ALK fusion mRNA was detected by reverse transcription PCR analysis of the malignant effusion. In November 2012, the patient was treated with crizotinib 250 mg orally twice per day.
