A 69-year-old male with a history of asbestos exposure and a family history of cancer presented to the hospital in October 2018. He reported swollen lymph nodes in the right inguinal region for 7 months and dyssynergic defecation for 1 month. A CT scan revealed multiple cystic low-density shadows in the right renal parenchyma without obvious enhancement, multiple nodules in the abdominal cavity, and a normal left kidney shape.

Further investigation with a pelvic CT scan revealed a large tumor in the pelvic cavity with inhomogeneous enhancement. Intraoperative findings showed widespread tumor involvement: tumor nodules scattered on the surface of the small intestinal mesentery (maximum diameter of 3.5 cm), tumor nodules distributed on the surface of the ligamentum teres and greater omentum (maximum diameter of 2 cm), patchy tumor nodules scattered in bilateral subphrenic peritoneum (largest size of 6 x 6 x 0.8 cm), and tumor nodules present in the para-colonic sulcus bilaterally (3 cm on the left, 2 cm on the right). The peritoneum of the left lower abdominal wall adhered to the sigmoid colon, harboring scattered small tumor nodules with invasion to the rectum and mesorectum. The small intestine, mesentery, ileocecal and pelvic masses formed a dense adhesion at 400 cm from the flexor ligament. The Peritoneal Cancer Index (PCI) score was 24.

The patient underwent cytoreduction, resulting in minimal residual disease. Gross examination revealed a huge (18 x 15 x 11 cm) tumor located in the pelvic cavity. The tumor section was grayish yellow, solid, and of medium texture. Two masses located in the omentum measured 2 x 2 x 0.3 cm and 1 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm. The section was grayish red and soft. Histopathological analysis showed that most tumor cells were arranged in sheet-like structures without papillary patterns. Some tumor cells were arranged in tubular structures. The tumor cells had clear cytoplasm, were large and round to polygonal, displayed abundant clear cytoplasm with an evident cytoplasmic membrane and eccentric small round nuclei. Mitotic figures were rare.

Immunohistochemical staining was performed. Tumor cells exhibited diffuse strong staining for cytokeratins (CKs), Vimentin, D2–40, Wilms’ tumor 1 (WT-1) and INI-1. Tumor cells were focally positive for calretinin. The following results were also obtained: CK+, EMA+, CK7+, CAM5.2-, CK20-, CK8/18-, CK5/6-, Vimentin+, Calretinin Focal +, WT-1+, D2-40+, MC-, CD10-, RCC-, CD15-, PAX8-, CDX-2-, SATB2-, CDH17-, GATA3-, CEA-, B72.3-, Ber-EP4-, GPC3-, Hepatocyte-, HMB45-, Melan-A-, S100-, a-inhibin-, CD117-, Dog-1-, Erg-, FLI-1-, P63-, SMA-, Desmin Focally +, Ki67 Index 20%, P53+, DES Focally +, TTF-1-, INI-1+. Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with primary peritoneal epithelioid mesothelioma of clear cell type.
