The patient's condition evolved to include severe parenchymal edema. The adenocarcinoma transformed into squamous cell lung carcinoma. The patient developed a brain tumor and experienced CNS progression. The patient's cancer became crizotinib‐resistant. Eventually, the patient developed lorlatinib resistance.
