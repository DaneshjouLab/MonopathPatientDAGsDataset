A patient presented with headache and was found to have a large right-sided intraparenchymal hemorrhage and smaller left-sided hemorrhage on head CT. CTA revealed a vascular pouch in the region of the hemorrhage. The patient showed sudden neurologic decline, and repeat imaging revealed enlargement of the hematoma with significant brain compression. The patient underwent emergent angiography revealing a distal cortical middle cerebral artery aneurysm, suspicious for mycotic etiology, which was treated through microsurgical excision at the time of hematoma evacuation. The aneurysm specimen was sent for cultures and pathology, revealing the diagnosis of metastatic non-small-cell carcinoma. Further inpatient workup did not reveal the primary neoplastic source. The patient's presentation was determined to be an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
