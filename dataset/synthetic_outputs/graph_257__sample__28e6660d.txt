A 40-year-old male with a history of smoking presented with a 5-year history of occasional abdominal discomfort and acute, stinging pain in the right upper abdomen. Blood sample analysis revealed a smoldering increase of transaminases and a C-reactive protein level of 22 mg/L. These abnormal blood test results prompted abdominal ultrasonography, which revealed a polycystic lesion of 9 cm in diameter in the right flank. A subsequent contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen revealed a polylobate hypodense formation, with multiple thin internal septa which are enriched after contrast (dimension 83 × 43 × 61 mm). Based on these imaging findings, a differential diagnosis was formulated, including peritoneal lymphangiomatosis, enteric duplication cyst, and benign multicystic peritoneal mesothelioma. To confirm the diagnosis, an exploratory laparoscopy was performed, confirming the presence of multiple cystic lesions of the peritoneum, some involving the omentum, with a weak adherence to the ascending colon. Complete excision of the neoformation, with a free margin on omental fat, was performed. A small lesion of the colonic serosa was treated with a prophylactic continuous suture with Vycril 2-0. The excised tissue was sent for pathology to confirm the diagnosis. Gross examination revealed a soft, yellowish tissue specimen measuring 13 × 9 × 4 cm, composed of multiple cysts, up to 1 cm in diameter, containing a clear fluid. Histological examination was also performed. Pathology confirmed the presence of Benign Multicystic Peritoneal Mesothelioma (BMPM). The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged after 2 days without complications.
