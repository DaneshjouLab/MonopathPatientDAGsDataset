A 64-year-old male was diagnosed in August 2020 with stage 3A left non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Positron emission tomography (PET) scan at diagnosis showed a large left hilar mass, with small mediastinal nodes. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) guided biopsy confirmed carcinoma. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was positive for P40 and negative for thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1), consistent with squamous cell carcinoma. PD-L1 expression was low at 20%. The patient received 6 weeks of definitive concurrent chemo-radiotherapy with weekly carboplatin and paclitaxel. He developed a mild infusion reaction to the last two doses of paclitaxel, requiring steroid pre-medications. Eosinophil count was normal. PET scan and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at completion of chemo-radiotherapy showed good response to treatment. The patient commenced two weekly maintenance therapy with durvalumab in October 2020. After the first dose of durvalumab, routine blood work-up showed eosinophilia of 5.4 \u00d7 109/L.
