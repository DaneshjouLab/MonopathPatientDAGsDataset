A patient with metastatic lung cancer and diabetes presented with a constellation of gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhea, nausea, and discomfort in the upper abdominal region, as well as early satiety. Endoscopic examination revealed tumour-like changes in the stomach, leading to a diagnosis of gastritis. Further investigation revealed chronic gastritis, specifically active chronic gastritis with erosions, lymphatic follicles, and lymphoepithelial lesions. The gastritis was determined to be ICI-induced, likely related to treatment for the metastatic lung cancer.

The patient experienced progression of the tumour-like changes in the stomach. Biopsies revealed active chronic gastritis with erosions and intestinal metaplasia. Following treatment, there was a decrease in diffuse inflammation and infiltration of the stomach wall. Subsequent biopsies showed active chronic non-erosive gastritis with pyogenic granuloma and a hyperplastic polyp, as well as gastric mucosal atrophy and a hyperplastic gastric polyp. Ultimately, the patient experienced symptom relief and achieved remission of the gastritis.

During the course of treatment, the patient also experienced diarrhea, which was diagnosed as ICI-induced colitis. Additional immune-related adverse events included a skin rash, pruritus, hypothyroidism, hepatitis, pneumonitis, and renal failure. The gastritis was specifically attributed to nivolumab.
