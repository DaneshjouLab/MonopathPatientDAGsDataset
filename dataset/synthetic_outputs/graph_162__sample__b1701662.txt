A patient with a history of squamous cell carcinoma, who underwent a left upper lobe resection two years prior, developed mediastinal lymph node metastasis. This was confirmed by surgical biopsy. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a tumour proportion score of 85% for PD-L1 expression using a murine 22C-3 antibody. Consequently, pembrolizumab treatment (200 mg every three weeks) was initiated.

Fourteen months after starting pembrolizumab, the patient experienced an increase in serum amylase and lipase to grade 2 (CTCAE version 4.1). A PET-CT scan revealed a round, highly integrated lesion with rough, irregular edges at the pancreatic head. A CT scan showed slightly swollen pancreatic parenchyma and mild pancreatic duct dilation. Pancreatic tumour markers were also elevated: CA19-9 149.3 U/mL (normal 0-36.9 U/mL), SPan-1 44.7 U/mL (0-30 U/mL), and DUPAN-2 412 U/mL (0-150 U/mL).

Prednisolone 90 mg (1 mg/kg/day) was then administered. Fifteen days after initiating prednisolone, a follow-up PET-CT scan showed decreased integration at the pancreatic head, with no mass-like lesion. A CT scan showed normalization of the size of the whole pancreas. Pancreatic tumour markers gradually decreased.

Four months after starting prednisolone, pancreatic tumour marker levels returned to normal. Pancreatic exocrine enzymes and radiographic findings also normalized.
