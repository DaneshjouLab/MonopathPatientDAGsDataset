Approximately 2–7% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer harbor anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement events. Typical ALK actionable rearrangements are sensitive to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, different types of ALK fusion influence the clinical outcomes of this therapeutic approach. Approximately 10–40% of patients with ALK-fusion positive non-small cell lung cancer do not respond to ALK-TKI therapy. Therefore, it is important to accurately identify the types of ALK rearrangement for appropriate selection of clinical treatment.

A patient with lung adenocarcinoma was found to have a novel solute carrier family 8 member A1 (SLC8A1)-ALK fusion type using DNA-targeted next-generation sequencing. Further reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Sanger sequencing demonstrated the rearrangement as a B-cell CLL/lymphoma 11A (BCL11A)-ALK fusion at the transcriptional level. The patient showed a rapid and strong response to treatment with crizotinib, which lasted for 9 months. After developing resistance to crizotinib, the patient responded well to treatment with alectinib.
