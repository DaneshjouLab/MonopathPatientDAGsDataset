A 79-year-old male, born in 1945, with a prolonged history of recurrent lower gastrointestinal bleeding attributed to digestive angiodysplasia, which had persisted for over 30 years, was investigated. He was diagnosed with acquired von Willebrand syndrome (AVWS) at the age of 53, after experiencing repeated episodes of lower gastrointestinal bleeding due to digestive angiodysplasia. Notably, there was no personal or family history of bleeding prior to the diagnosis. Initial biological investigations revealed a qualitative deficiency of von Willebrand factor (VWF), with abnormal values for factor VIII activity (FVIII:C), VWF antigen (VWF:Ag), and VWF activity using the ristocetin cofactor (VWF:Rco), respectively, 40%, 20%, and <10% (normal range 50–150%).

For the first 10 years, the clinical picture was predominantly dominated by digestive bleeding. Thus, the patient was diagnosed with Heyde syndrome, defined by the triad of severe aortic stenosis, recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding due to angiodysplasia, and AVWS. In 2005, an etiological assessment for VWD revealed a low abundance IgM kappa monoclonal spike in serum protein electrophoresis, suggesting monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Simultaneously, the biological diagnosis of AVWS was confirmed using advanced diagnostic techniques, including VWF multimer electrophoresis. This revealed a loss of high-molecular-weight multimers (HMWMs) and a VWF propeptide-to-VWF:Ag ratio of 3.95 (normal range < 2.4) in a patient with group O blood, supporting the acquired etiology of the patient’s VWF deficiency. Furthermore, no antibodies against VWF were detected.

Therapeutically, in the event of bleeding, the patient received iterative transfusions, but immunoglobulin infusions were unsurprisingly ineffective, given the presence of an IgM spike. The various VWF concentrates administered showed mixed efficacy, with poor recovery and a short half-life. The patient underwent multiple major interventions, including partial gastrectomy for fundic angiodysplasia, ileal resection, repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm complicated by hemorrhagic shock, electrocoagulation, and ethmoidectomy.

Due to the onset of angina, a transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) was performed urgently in 2020, but this did not resolve the VWF deficit. In 2022, the patient was diagnosed with non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) harboring the KRAS G12C mutation and initiated second-line treatment with sotorasib. Notably, one year after the initiation of sotorasib therapy, the patient’s hemostasis had normalized, accompanied by significant improvements in VWF levels. VWF multimer electrophoresis demonstrated the restoration of high-molecular-weight multimers (HMWMs), and serum protein electrophoresis no longer detected MGUS. These improvements were likely attributable to the indirect effects of sotorasib on the bone marrow microenvironment. By inhibiting KRAS in stromal cells and osteoclasts, sotorasib may have disrupted the supportive niche necessary for malignant plasma cell survival, resulting in a reduction in the monoclonal spike. Unfortunately, the patient eventually succumbed to carcinogenic pleurisy.
