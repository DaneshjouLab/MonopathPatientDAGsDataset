A 42-year-old male presented in April 2021 with acute right-sided abdominal pain, vomiting, dysuria, and fever. The pain was located in the right lower abdomen and aggravated by movement. He reported nausea and non-bilious vomiting, as well as painful micturition with concentrated urine.

The patient had a history of working as a construction worker for 15 years, working 8-hour shifts, 6 days a week. He denied any prior abdominal trauma or surgery. He also denied any history of weight loss, diabetes, hypertension, tuberculosis, or pancreatitis. Notably, the patient reported handling asbestos daily for over 10 years.

Physical examination revealed a heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 110/70 mm Hg, and a temperature of 39Â°C. Distension and guarding were noted in the right iliac and umbilical region. Chest radiology and cardiogram were normal. Sputum was negative for acid-fast bacilli.

Laboratory investigations showed a haemoglobin level of 10.4 g/dl, white blood cell count of 6400 per microlitre, serum creatinine of 0.9 mg/dl, alanine-aminotransferase of 16 IU/L, aspartate-transferase of 51 IU/L, lipase of 149 IU/L, amylase of 49 IU/L, serum Na+ of 129 mmol/L, Glucose of 146 mg/dl, and partial pressure of oxygen of 54 mm Hg. Urine microscopy showed numerous red blood cells.

Abdominal ultrasound revealed a well-defined intra-abdominal cyst with clear echoes situated in the pelvis, compressing and displacing the urinary bladder to the left. The rest of the organs appeared normal.

A CT scan showed a solitary well-defined intraperitoneal cyst consisting of fluid showing low attenuation. The wall of the cyst was 1 cm thick, with no contrast enhancement. It was situated in the pelvis, compressing the urinary bladder. No free fluid was observed.

A contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen confirmed a solitary cyst with a non-enhancing wall, separate from the urinary bladder. The pancreas and the rest of the abdominal organs were normal. There was no ascites, and the cyst had no communication with either the bowel or the urinary bladder.

Laparotomy revealed a large intra-abdominal cyst in the pelvis, compressing the superior aspect of the urinary bladder. The cyst was free from the mesentery, omentum, and mesocolon, with no connection to the anterior abdominal wall, umbilicus, or urinary bladder.

Gross examination of the cyst revealed a blackish wall suggestive of infarction and clear fluid within.

Complete excision of the cyst was performed.

The patient was given third-generation cephalosporins for 3 days.

Fluid culture showed no bacterial growth.
