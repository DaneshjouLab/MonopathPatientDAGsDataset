A patient with lung adenocarcinoma, a subtype of non-small-cell lung cancer, presented with a novel *CD74-ROS1* fusion variant. This variant, specifically *CD74* exon 3 fused to *ROS1* exon 34, was identified through hybrid capture-based next-generation sequencing, after a conventional RT-PCR-based test failed to detect the *ROS1* fusion. The patient was initially treated with crizotinib and responded well. However, the patient later relapsed with brain metastasis and was subsequently treated with entrectinib. The tumor responded to entrectinib, indicating the oncogenic activity of this novel fusion variant. *ROS1* rearrangements are found in 1–2% of patients with non‐small‐cell lung cancer.
