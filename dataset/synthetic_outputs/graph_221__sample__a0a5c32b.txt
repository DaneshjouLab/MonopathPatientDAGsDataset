A patient was diagnosed with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) and subsequently underwent pleurectomy/decortication (P/D). As a postoperative complication, the patient developed an air leak, resulting in empyema. The empyema led to the development of residual thoracic airspace (RTS) after the P/D procedure.

Following the surgery, the patient received two courses of cisplatin and pemetrexed therapy. The postoperative course was marked by prolonged air leakage, but pleurodesis was not required, and the chest tube was removed on postoperative day 16. The patient then received two additional courses of pemetrexed in combination with cisplatin.

Throughout the postoperative follow-up period, chest CT scans showed persistent RTS in the right chest cavity (Figure 1A). At 6 months after surgery, a chest CT revealed nodules on the surface of the right lung, which gradually increased in size and were diagnosed as a recurrence of mesothelioma.

Ten months post-surgery, the patient started combination therapy with nivolumab and ipilimumab. However, this was discontinued shortly after the first course due to the development of grade 2 pneumonitis. Oral prednisolone (30 mg/day) was administered to treat the pneumonitis, which improved, and the prednisolone dosage was reduced to 5 mg/day.

Twelve months post-surgery, a CT scan showed an enlarged RTS and small fluid retention in the airspace without lung consolidation (Figure 1B). At this time, the patient was asymptomatic and followed up.

Approximately 3 weeks later, the patient developed a cough. A chest X-ray showed an air-fluid level (Figure 1C), suggesting fluid accumulation in the RTS. Thoracic drainage was performed, revealing air leakage and purulent fluid, leading to a diagnosis of fistulous pyothorax. A chest CT identified the responsible bronchus in the right middle lobe (Figure 1D). An attempt was made to perform bronchial embolization with an endobronchial spigot (EWS), but this failed because some spigots penetrated the empyema cavity.
