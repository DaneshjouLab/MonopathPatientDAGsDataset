A patient with Stage IIIB primary lung cancer developed several immune-related adverse events following treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors. The patient experienced a complex clinical course involving various episodes of cystitis. Initially, the patient presented with lower urinary tract symptoms, including micturition pain and glans penile pain. This was diagnosed as bacterial cystitis with pyuria and inflammatory findings. However, the patient subsequently developed non-bacterial cystitis, which recurred multiple times. The cystitis proved to be steroid-resistant, evolving into a steroid-resistant immune-related adverse event. The patient's clinical picture was further complicated by the presence of colitis. The patient's history also included concerns about other cancers and tumors, although the primary focus remained on the lung cancer and the associated immune-related adverse events, specifically the refractory cystitis. The differential diagnosis included interstitial cystitis, but the recurrent nature and association with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy strongly suggested an immune-mediated etiology. The presence of stones was also considered but ruled out. The patient experienced multiple episodes of cystitis, both bacterial and non-bacterial, highlighting the challenges in managing immune-related adverse events in the context of lung cancer treatment.
