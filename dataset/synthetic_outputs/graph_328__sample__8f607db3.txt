A 58-year-old woman with a past medical history of pre-existing cardiac pathology or peripheral artery disease and active smoking presented to the emergency department for acute visual defect and headache. Brain MRI revealed multiple pathological cerebral lesions with intracranial hypertension. She was treated with 1 mg/kg/d corticosteroids. The patient was diagnosed with left hilar lung adenocarcinoma (TTF1+) harbouring KRAS, PI3KCa and PTEN mutations, with left adrenal gland and cerebral metastasis. She received in toto radiotherapy followed by carboplatin and pemetrexed. After 4 cycles of ipilimumab, the patient developed pericardial effusion. Pathology from pericardial tissue revealed acute inflammation with lymphocyte dominance, or lymphocytic pericarditis with reactive mesothelial cells, free of malignant cells.
