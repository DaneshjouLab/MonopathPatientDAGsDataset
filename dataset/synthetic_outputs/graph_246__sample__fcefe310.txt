A 65-year-old man presented with a right lower lobe nodule, diagnosed as clinical stage IIIA lung adenocarcinoma with subcarinal and paratracheal lymph node metastases (c-T1bN2M0). The patient had a 44 pack-year history of smoking and dyslipidemia. He underwent induction chemotherapy with cisplatin (75 mg/m2), pemetrexed (500 mg/m2), and bevacizumab (15 mg/kg). After three cycles of chemotherapy, tumor and metastatic lymph nodes were reduced in size to 48%, and the final preoperative staging was yc-T1aN0M0, IA1. On day 49 after the final administration of chemotherapy, the patient underwent right lower lobectomy with systemic lymph node dissection. The bronchial stump was covered with a nonpedicled pericardial fat pad. Pathological examination revealed no residual tumor cells in the resected specimens. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a nodule in the right lower lobe with a maximal standard uptake value (SUV max) of 3.5. (18) F\u20102\u2010fluoro\u20102\u2010deoxyglucose\u2010positron emission tomography showed an SUVmax of 3.9, and endobronchial ultrasound\u2010transbronchial needle aspiration revealed metastatic cells in both nodes. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged home on postoperative day (POD) 9.
