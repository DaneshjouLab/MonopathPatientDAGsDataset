A 68-year-old Asian male with a 30-year history of psoriasis, previously treated with UVB phototherapy, presented at age 66 with left upper lobe Stage IIB (pT3 (7.8cm) N0 (0/12)) adenocarcinoma. He underwent lobectomy and received four cycles of adjuvant cisplatin and vinorelbine. Surveillance imaging one year after adjuvant chemotherapy showed multifocal ground glass nodules in lungs bilaterally with interval growth over multiple scans. Molecular characterization identified an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 19 deletion. The patient started on first-line osimertinib 80 mg daily one-and-half years after completion of adjuvant chemotherapy. Within two weeks of starting osimertinib, the patient had significant worsening of pre-existing scaly psoriatic plaques with desquamation over his face, trunk, upper and lower extremities, including inflammation of his fingertips with intermittent abdominal pain. Osimertinib was held, and Dermatology prescribed hydrocortisone cream and UVB phototherapy for psoriasis. Four weeks after osimertinib was held, the patient developed a temperature of 39.5\u00b0C with tachycardia and worsening abdominal pain and was admitted to hospital. Infection was ruled out. Skin toxicity was deemed psoriasis worsened by osimertinib potentially with associated dermatitis. Following hospital discharge, the patient commenced a 10-week course of UVB phototherapy, resulting in 90% clearance of skin lesions.
