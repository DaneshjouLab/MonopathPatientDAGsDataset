Resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) remains a significant clinical challenge. Despite the established efficacy of first- and second-generation TKIs in the treatment of NSCLC, resistance to these agents can develop. Increasing resistance to the otherwise effective and well-tolerated pharmacologic interventions for NSCLC poses a significant clinical challenge. With the emergence of resistance, the efficacy of TKIs against NSCLC diminishes progressively; hence, gaining a deeper comprehension of resistance mechanisms to the remaining effective TKIs, like osimertinib, becomes crucial.

However, patients can develop acquired resistance to osimertinib within the first two years of use via heterogeneous and various possible mechanisms. Resistance to osimertinib can occur due to acquired resistance mechanisms, which can be categorized as EGFR-dependent or EGFR-independent. One possible mechanism by which resistance to osimertinib develops is via histologic transformation. Histologic transformation involves the transformation of adenocarcinoma to another histological subtype of lung carcinoma; previous studies have observed transformations to small cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma.

Here we present a case of histologic transformation from non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) to carcinosarcoma, possibly representing a new manifestation of osimertinib resistance. While histologic transformation has been previously reported, we present a novel histological transformation from adenocarcinoma to carcinosarcoma, leading to resistance to osimertinib and disease progression. This case represents an important and detrimental mechanism of resistance.

This case report presents a unique instance of histologic transformation from NSCLC to carcinosarcoma, representing a previously unreported manifestation of osimertinib resistance. The transformation was associated with additional EGFR mutations and alterations in RB and TP53. The most prevalent EGFR mutations involve in-frame deletions in exon 19 and a point mutation in exon 21 (L858R), together accounting for approximately 90% of EGFR alterations.

This case underscores the need for further research to elucidate the molecular mechanisms behind histologic transformation and explore novel therapeutic strategies to address osimertinib resistance in NSCLC. Understanding and addressing these mechanisms are crucial for improving outcomes in patients facing this challenging form of resistance.
