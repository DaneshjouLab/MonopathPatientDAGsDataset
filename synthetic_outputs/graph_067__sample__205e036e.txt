A 67-year-old male presented in 2016 with stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), specifically adenocarcinoma. He underwent a right middle lobectomy, followed by adjuvant carboplatin/paclitaxel chemotherapy and postoperative radiotherapy (PORT).

In 2022, the patient developed metastatic disease in the right lung, liver, and brain. Due to microcytosis, upper and lower GI endoscopy was performed to investigate a possible gastrointestinal primary, but no lesions were identified. The single brain metastasis was treated with stereotactic radiation.

The patient then received infusional 5-fluorouracil/oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) empirically. Histopathological analysis of liver lesions identified a spindle cell carcinoma likely pulmonary in origin despite atypical features, with a high proliferative Ki-67 index (90%). A liver biopsy showed metastatic spindle cell carcinoma on H&E stain. Sections demonstrated a spindle cell neoplasm with significant mitotic activity and focal necrosis. Immunohistochemistry showed the tumor cells positive for AE1/AE3 and CK8/18, but negative for Alk-1, CK7, CK20, CDX-2, and CD117.

The patient received nine weekly doses of docetaxel, resulting in modest shrinkage of approximately 10-15%.
