A 46-year-old man with a 40 pack-year smoking history presented to the emergency department for worsening dyspnea and fever. Patient's dyspnea and fever led to a chest roentgenogram and CT chest scan. Chest roentgenogram showed diffuse bilateral opacities with peripheral distribution. CT chest scan revealed peripheral bilateral ground-glass opacity (GGO) with crazy paving appearance plus a 40-mm nodule in the right upper lobe. Imaging findings prompted SARS-CoV-2 testing. Nasal swab tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and the diagnosis of COVID-19 was made. Following COVID-19 diagnosis, the patient was managed and prepared for discharge. Patient was discharged 5 days after initial presentation. Follow-up SARS-CoV-2 testing was performed. A repeated nasal swab at 16 days was negative for SARS-CoV-2. Further investigation of the lung nodule with PET/CT imaging was performed. Positron emission tomography/ CT after 30 days showed a standardized uptake value (SUV) of 9 for the nodule, with slight inflammatory uptake of hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes. Improvement of lung opacities was noted. Follow-up chest CT and pulmonary function testing were performed to assess recovery from COVID-19. Chest computed tomography scans 30 days after COVID-19 showed an almost complete resolution of peripheral opacities. Pulmonary function was within normal ranges, with forced expiratory volume in 1 second of 3.99 liters (102% of predicted value) and forced vital capacity of 4.98 liters (103%). Diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (Dlco) was preserved (99%). Patient has a medical history positive for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Further management and follow-up.
