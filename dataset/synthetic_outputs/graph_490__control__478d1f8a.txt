Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a reversible clinical syndrome usually characterized by a range of neurological manifestations and distinctive neuroimaging findings reflecting vasogenic edema. PRES has been described in the context of various clinical settings including: renal failure, blood pressure fluctuations, use of cytotoxic drugs, autoimmune disorders and eclampsia. Hypercalcemia is rarely associated with PRES. We report a patient with lung cancer presenting as PRES secondary to hypercalcemia.
