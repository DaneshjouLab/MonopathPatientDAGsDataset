In 2016, a 77-year-old man, a former smoker, was diagnosed with prostate adenocarcinoma and treated with radiation therapy. In May 2017, the patient's PSA increased to 5.9 ng/mL, leading to a radical prostatectomy and lymphadenectomy. Histological report indicated stage pT3b N1 Mx R1 prostate adenocarcinoma with a single lymph node metastasis. Adjuvant treatment with leuprorelin was initiated. Subsequently, the patient was admitted to the emergency room for acute respiratory distress. A CT scan showed left pleural effusion, thickening, and nodules of the pleural surface, several mediastinal lymph node metastases, and a bone metastasis in the IX left rib. Pleural effusion cytology came back negative for malignancy. An ultrasound-guided bone biopsy of the lesion at the IX rib level was carried out. Histology of the bone biopsy revealed malignant cells with adenocarcinoma aggregation. Immunohistochemistry showed the cancer cells were highly immunoreactive for TTF-1 and BerEP4 and negative for the prostatic markers NKX3.1 and PSA, leading to a diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma. CT scans of the lung lesions after chemotherapy with carboplatin and pemetrexed showed significant response to therapy of mediastinal, pleural, and lung lesions. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) profiling of the rib lesion revealed the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion as a unique alteration. The prostate cancer tissue was positive for the prostate immunohistochemical markers (NKX3.1, PSA) and negative for the lung markers (TTF-1, BerEP4) but harbored the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion as the only molecular alteration. In August 2019, the patient's serum PSA increased to 2.3 ng/mL. Multiple pleural biopsies were performed to exclude concomitant lung cancer and prostate cancer metastases. Histological diagnosis revealed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma positive for the lung markers TTF-1 and CK7 and negative for the prostatic markers (PSA and NKX3.1). The patient started on first-line therapy with enzalutamide. In January 2020, the patient was admitted to the thoracic surgery ward due to recurrent pleural effusion and respiratory failure. Talc pleurodesis was performed. A CT scan in January 2020 showed progressive disease with several pleural metastases and bone metastases of the IX and V left ribs with muscular infiltration. PSA level was 1 ng/mL. In February 2020, a CT-guided pleural biopsy revealed a papillary poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.
