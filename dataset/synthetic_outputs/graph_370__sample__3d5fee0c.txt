A 64-year-old male with a history of lifelong smoking, bronchiectasis, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus developed recurrent and massive hemoptysis lasting six days, with approximately 200 ml of bright red blood per episode. The patient had previously received two courses of chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy for advanced lung squamous cell carcinoma (stage IVA). Physical examination revealed decreased breath sounds on the left side. The patient was hypoxic, requiring nasal cannula oxygenation at 3 L/min (oxygen saturation was 99%), and exhibited elevated leucocyte (22.2 × 10^9/L), neutrophil counts (19.6 × 10^9/L), and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (16.20 mg/L). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed a giant tumor (45 mm minor axis diameter) in the left lung hilus and occlusion of the left superior pulmonary vein, and the left superior pulmonary artery in the tumor. The pulmonary artery was embolized in a patient with an occluded pulmonary vein to manage massive hemoptysis. The patient has stenosis and obliteration of the pulmonary vein. Imaging revealed destroyed lung associated with bronchiectasis located at the upper lobe.
