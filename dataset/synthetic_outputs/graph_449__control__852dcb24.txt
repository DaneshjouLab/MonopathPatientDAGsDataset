An 81-year-old woman, treated with denosumab for multiple lung cancer bone metastases, presented to the hospital with a swelling in the upper jaw. Computed tomography showed osteolysis, periosteal reaction of the maxillary bone, maxillary sinusitis, and osteosclerosis of the zygomatic bone. The patient underwent conservative treatment; however, osteosclerosis of the zygomatic bone progressed to osteolysis. Despite treatment, osteolysis of the maxillary bone progressed, and fistula formation was observed in the cheek. Resection of the bony sequestrum and debridement of the fistula were performed under general anesthesia. Thereafter, the painful bone exposure improved, but the cutaneous fistula persisted. Histopathological examination revealed sequestration with granulation tissue and abscess formation. Bacterial culture of the fistular secretions grew methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* (MRSA). Eight months after surgery, CT showed progression of osteosclerosis of the zygomatic bone to osteolysis. Fifteen months postoperatively, CT revealed separation of the collapsed bone and improvement of the maxillary sinus mucosal thickening. The case was diagnosed as medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) progression rather than a tumor. Another surgery was planned 2 years after the first one, but the patient was admitted to another hospital for a femoral fracture and was lost to follow-up.
