A patient presented with right-sided malignant epithelial pleural mesothelioma. The patient underwent video-assisted thoracic surgery with pleural biopsy, which confirmed epithelial malignant pleural mesothelioma. Initial symptoms included pleural effusion and pleural thickening. Positron emission tomography revealed lymph node metastases and distant metastases. The patient was treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin and pemetrexed. Following neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the patient underwent pleurectomy/decortication.

Due to the tumor's invasion into the right atrium and pericardium, the patient underwent a median sternotomy for en bloc macroscopic complete resection of the entire pleura via extrapleural pneumonectomy. During the same procedure, the patient also underwent mitral valve replacement and a maze procedure, indicating pre-existing cardiac issues requiring cardiac surgery.

Post-surgery, the patient experienced stable disease. The patient's case was classified as MPM (Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma).
