In February 2022, a 70-year-old female presented with flank pain. A CT scan revealed multiple liver and bone lesions. Further imaging with FDG PET/CT revealed lung nodules and liver lesions. Two biopsies of a single liver lesion were performed at an outside facility and read as “low-grade NET,” but only 1% tumor tissue was present for analysis; thus, there was no mention of mitosis, necrosis, or proliferative index (Ki-67). The patient complained of fatigue, night sweats, anorexia, and severe back and pelvic pain. Tumor marker evaluation revealed chromogranin 1955 ng/mL, CEA 2213.6 ng/ mL, and CA19-9 96 U/mL. A CT-guided biopsy of a liver lesion showed metastatic carcinoid tumor with organoid nesting. Tumor cells were uniform with finely granular nuclear chromatin. Mitotic rate was 3 mitoses per 2 mm2 and necrosis was present, consistent with an atypical carcinoid. Review of prior imaging from January 2019 showed that 68Ga DOTATATE PET/CT showed uptake within the bone and supraclavicular/mediastinal lymph nodes, minimal uptake within the liver or lung lesions. Ki-67 labeling index was approximately 8%. DOTATATE PET/CT scans showed DOTATATE uptake in the bones, but minimal uptake in the lungs and none in the liver. FDG PET/CT at the same time showed foci of FDG avid disease in the left upper lung nodule, numerous times in the liver, and throughout the axial skeleton.
