A 76-year-old woman with a history of invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast treated with lumpectomy followed by an aromatase inhibitor (diagnosed eight months prior) and a prior 20 pack-year tobacco use history (ceased 35 years ago), presented with acute onset fevers, dyspnea, and cough. She also had recent travel to the Southwest United States. Three months prior to this presentation, she was diagnosed with lung cancer after presenting with hypoxemia on exertion. CT showed a right upper lobe mass with lung and liver metastases. Biopsy of the lung and liver revealed metastatic adenocarcinoma consistent with lung origin and no actionable mutations on standard tumor molecular profiling. Palliative systemic therapy with carboplatin, pemetrexed, and pembrolizumab administered intravenously every 21 days was commenced. Imaging following the first two cycles of therapy showed stable disease. Midway through the fourth cycle of palliative systemic therapy, she developed fevers, dyspnea on exertion, and cough. CT angiogram of the chest showed no pulmonary embolism, but revealed confluent regions of consolidation in the lungs bilaterally (significantly worse on the left) and a small left pleural effusion on a background of known bilateral cavitary lung lesions. She was admitted to the intensive care unit with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 87. She was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics due to concern for a primary infectious process. Worsening hypoxemia on day three necessitated endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. Positive end-expiratory pressure was titrated, and lung protective ventilation utilizing a low tidal volume strategy was employed. Bronchoscopy on day three revealed thin secretions in the left lower lobe, but was otherwise unremarkable. Bronchoalveolar lavage studies showed slight neutrophilic predominance (70% and 54% polymorphonuclear cells in two separate samples). Microbiology studies were negative for bacterial, viral, legionella, fungal, nocardia, and acid-fast bacteria cultures. Aspergillus galactomannan antigen from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was negative, as were blood and urine markers of infection. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal right ventricular size and systolic function without significant valvular disease, signs of increased filling pressures, or atrial septal defect.
