It has been associated with various factors, including medications, particularly antibiotics like daptomycin. Daptomycin is an antibiotic used for resistant Gram-positive organisms. The patient experienced pleuritic chest pain, cough, and dyspnea. The diagnosis was Daptomycin-induced acute eosinophilic pneumonia.
