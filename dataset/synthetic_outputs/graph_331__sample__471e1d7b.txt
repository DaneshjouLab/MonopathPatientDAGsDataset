In February 2021, a 42-year-old female, a light smoker with a 9 pack-year history, presented with stage IV adenocarcinoma of the lung (T1cN3M1c (HEP, OSS, PLE, LYM)). The patient subsequently developed a deep venous thrombosis and a pulmonary embolism. While on therapeutic anticoagulation, the patient developed multiple intracerebral infarcts necessitating treatment with both low molecular heparin and ASS. Initial molecular diagnostic testing was performed using PCR-based methods covering the hotspots in EGFR, KRAS and BRAF and immunohistochemistry analysis (IHC) for PD-L1, ALK and ROS1 due to limited and sparse FFPE tissue. PDL-1 status TPS was 80%. High ROS1-expression was noted in the cytoplasm of tumor cells. On February 24th, 2021, the patient started crizotinib treatment based on the positive IHC result. The following day, February 25th, 2021, hybrid capture-based NGS analysis (HC-NGS) was reported on a pre-therapeutically taken pleural sample. Analysis confirmed ROS1 positivity and revealed a CD74-ROS1 translocation (C7:R34) and an additional nonsense mutation in TP53. Eight weeks after the start of crizotinib, a CT scan revealed good partial remission of all tumor sites. However, four months after the start of crizotinib therapy, in June 2021, the patient progressed, in particular with histologically confirmed hepatic metastases.
