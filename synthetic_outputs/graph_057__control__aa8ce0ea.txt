An elderly woman with small cell lung cancer was diagnosed with choreoathetosis due to autoimmune-mediated paraneoplastic syndrome. Choreoathetosis is a rare complication of paraneoplastic syndrome, particularly associated with small cell lung cancer. The patient also tested positive for anti-Hu antibodies. The appearance of new focal neurological deficits in patients with small cell lung cancer should provoke evaluation for potential differential diagnoses, such as paraneoplastic syndrome or adverse effects related to cancer therapies including chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiation after ruling out acute treatable neurological conditions such as stroke, nutritional deficiencies, infections, and metabolic causes. The differential diagnoses for focal neurological deficits such as stroke, immunotherapy-related toxicity, radiation-induced toxicity, and brain metastasis were considered, but the presence of onconeural antibodies made paraneoplastic syndrome a more likely diagnosis. Management of choreoathetosis in paraneoplastic syndrome can be challenging, with limited treatment options available.
