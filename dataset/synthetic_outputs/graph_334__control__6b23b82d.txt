A 78-year-old Japanese man with adenocarcinoma received combination therapy including rabeprazole 10 mg. Thirty days after the initial treatment, the patient was admitted to the hospital due to sustained diarrhea. On admission, laboratory tests revealed that his serum creatinine (Cr) level had increased from a baseline value of 0.84 to 1.99 mg/dL, with proteinuria and hematuria. Initially, pre-renal acute kidney injury (AKI) was suspected as a consequence of diarrhea. Hydration with extracellular fluid was initiated; however, the kidney function deteriorated, as indicated by a Cr level of 3.34 mg/dL. Renal biopsy revealed severe acute tubular injury (ATI) accompanied by interstitial nephritis.
