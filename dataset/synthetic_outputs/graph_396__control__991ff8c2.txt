**A Multimodal Approach to Evaluate for Cardiac Metastasis in a Case of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer**

An 84-year-old male with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer presented with a clinical course, echocardiogram, and <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET-CT findings that were suggestive of endocardial metastasis. The <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET-CT, often used for preoperative determination of malignant metastasis, showed uptake foci that raised suspicion for cardiac involvement. Nine months into therapy, after extensive consultation, the patient consented to cardiac MRI (CMRI). The CMRI showed no evidence of cardiac metastasis.
