A patient with a history of cerebral infarction and hypertension, managed with clopidogrel and candesartan respectively, was referred to our hospital for evaluation and treatment of suspected lung cancer. The patient had a history of smoking 20 cigarettes per day until the age of 50 but had abstained for the past 16 years. CT imaging suggested lung cancer in the left lower lobe. PET-CT showed mild uptake in the left lower lobe mass, with no evidence of distant metastasis. Contrast-enhanced brain MRI showed no abnormalities suggestive of metastasis. Bronchoscopy was performed, but transbronchial lung biopsy and brushing/irrigation cytology yielded no evidence of malignancy. Based on these findings, stage IB primary lung cancer was suspected, and a surgical biopsy followed by lobectomy was planned. Intraoperative needle biopsy confirmed adenocarcinoma, leading to left lower lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node dissection. Immediately after chest wound closure, a large volume of air leakage was observed, along with pneumatocele formation and perforation on the mediastinal side of the upper lobe. Postoperatively, a mild air leak persisted, requiring a single session of adhesive therapy. Cases of pneumatocele formation following pulmonary resection are increasingly reported, yet its underlying pathogenesis and optimal treatment remain unclear. Lung fragility and increased negative intrathoracic pressure following resection are key risk factors for pneumatocele formation. While most cases can be managed conservatively, surgical intervention should be considered in symptomatic cases, particularly those presenting with pneumothorax or hemoptysis.
