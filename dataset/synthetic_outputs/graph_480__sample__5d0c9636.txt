A 70-year-old ex-smoker with a 25 pack-year smoking history, hypertension, and ischemic heart disease (status post percutaneous coronary intervention) presented with 3 months of hemoptysis. The patient underwent imaging. CT scan of the thorax showed a well-circumscribed lesion in the upper lobe of the right lung and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. PET scan showed an upper lobe lesion in the right lung and metabolically avid right hilar and right para-tracheal lymph nodes. Imaging findings led to biopsy and diagnosis. Radiological staging was cT3N2M0 (Stage III-B). CT-guided biopsy of the lung lesion revealed non-small cell carcinoma favoring adenocarcinoma on histopathology. Immunohistochemistry was cytokeratin positive, TTF1 focally positive, p40 negative, and CD56 negative. EGFR PCR showed no mutation detected. Further biomarker testing was performed. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was negative for ALK gene rearrangement. Immunohistochemistry for PDL1 clone SP142 was positive for more than 50% TPS (total proportion score). The patient underwent surgical resection. The patient underwent upfront thoracotomy, leading to a right lung upper lobe lobectomy and mediastinal staging, resulting in pathological stage T3N0. Post-operative imaging showed disease progression. PET scan performed after surgery showed interval progression with hyper-metabolic pleural-based nodules, nodules in the right lung middle lobe and horizontal fissure, right para-tracheal and internal mammary lymphadenopathy.
