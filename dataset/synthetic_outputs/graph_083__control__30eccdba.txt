A patient presented with a persistent cough. Initial chest X-ray revealed abnormalities, prompting a Chest computed tomography scan. The CT scan revealed a 3.1 cm right lower lobe tumor, lymphadenopathy, right pleural effusion, and pericardial effusion. Further investigation revealed a lobulated lung mass. A transbronchial biopsy was performed, and molecular analysis using next-generation sequencing (Oncomine Dx Target Test) detected an EML4-ALK fusion gene. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining of the specimen revealed positivity for AE1/AE3, CAM5.2, E-cadherin, and thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) according to the IHC analysis. The lung mass was diagnosed as anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement-positive pulmonary adenocarcinoma.

Further imaging revealed multiple scattered nodules in both breasts. A needle biopsy of bilateral breast tumors was performed, and the histological findings on HE staining corresponded to adenocarcinoma derived from the lungs or breasts. Histological findings of bilateral needle biopsy of breast nodules were nearly identical to that of lung nodule. Fluorescence in situ hybridization showed ALK rearrangement. The patient was diagnosed with ALK rearrangement-positive pulmonary adenocarcinoma with bilateral scattered breast metastases, representing a metastatic form of lung adenocarcinoma.

The patient also had a medical history of bipolar disorder, sleep apnea syndrome, and hypertension. The carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) level was 282 U/mL.
