The study included adult patients with proven or suspected peripheral surgically resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), without evidence of lymph node disease in the preoperative study. These patients underwent robotic anatomical lung resection with systematic nodal dissection (SND). During the procedure, a transpleural injection of 1 mL of indocyanine green (ICG) diluted in 20% human albumin (concentration of 2.5 mg/mL) was administered into the peritumoral area. Systematic nodal dissection (SND) was performed in all cases.

Intraoperative assessment of lymph nodes was conducted using the FireFly system. Fluorescent lymph nodes were resected, confirmed ex vivo for ICG avidity, and sent to pathology separately.

The patient cohort included males with the following smoking status: Never (16.7%), Former (50%), and Current (33.3%). The median body mass index (BMI) was 26.26 kg/m2 (IQR 28.42–23.52). The median forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1%) was 99 (IQR 114.5–84.25), and the median diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO%) was 83 (IQR 103–75). Comorbidities included cardiopathy (12.5%), hypertension (33.3%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (16.7%), diabetes (8.3%), kidney insufficiency (8.3%), and previous malignancy (41.7%). The cancer clinical stage distribution was as follows: IA2 (cT1bN0) (25%), IA3 (cT1cN0) (37.5%), IB (cT2aN0) (12.5%), IIA (cT2bN0) (12.5%), and IIB (cT3N0) (12.5%). A small percentage of patients (4.17%) received induction treatment.

Surgical resection involved lobectomy in 22 patients (91.7%).
