A 60-year-old woman was diagnosed with endometrial cancer via curettage due to vaginal bleeding. A chest CT scan revealed a tumor located at the right anterior mediastinum. On March 13, 2019, the patient underwent a total hysterectomy with double appendages. Pathological examination revealed a 3.5 x 2.5 cm highly differentiated endometrial adenocarcinoma that invaded the superficial myometrium (<1/2 of the myometrium). No metastasis was found in bilateral pelvic lymph nodes, and the endometrial cancer was staged as pIA. No adjuvant therapy was administered, and the patient was advised to seek treatment for the mediastinal tumor.

Six months post-radical operation, the patient was admitted to the Department of Thoracic Surgery, asymptomatic. A thoracoabdominal CT scan showed a solitary 5.2 x 8.0 x 7.1 cm tumor in the right mediastinum near the pericardium. A bone scan showed no bone metastasis.

On September 7, 2019, the patient underwent video-assisted thoracoscopy. The tumor was found in the right cardiophrenic angle, approximately 8 cm in maximum diameter, with a hard texture and clear boundary, adhering to the pericardium and lower lobe of the right lung. It was determined that the tumor had grown in the diaphragm rather than in the mediastinum.

A thoracotomy was performed through the right fifth intercostal space. The diaphragm was resected along with a 1 cm margin of the tumor. The tumor had grown into the abdominal cavity and was stripped from the liverâ€™s surface. The tumor was removed with the invaded diaphragm. The diaphragmatic defect was repaired by a Dacron patch. The chest was closed, and the total bleeding volume was 500 mL.

The patient was able to get out of bed on the second day post-op, and the drainage tube was removed on the third day post-op.
