A 39-year-old male presented with a 6-month history of swelling on the left middle third of the face. The swelling, located on the left cheek region, initially presented as small but gradually increased to a size of 5 cm × 4 cm, causing mild facial asymmetry. The swelling extended from the infraorbital rim to the line joining the ala of the nose and ear lobule, and anteroposteriorly on the buccal mucosa from the distal aspect of the 24-28 region. On palpation, the swelling was nontender and firm in consistency.

Due to the facial swelling, an incisional biopsy was performed for histological evaluation. Macroscopic examination of the incisional biopsy revealed a single creamish brown soft-tissue bit, measuring 1.0 cm × 1.0 cm, with a firm consistency.

Microscopic examination of the incisional biopsy (H&E stain) showed a highly cellular connective tissue stroma with nests and sheets of small round-to-ovoid cells, ill-defined borders, scanty cytoplasm, and finely granular nuclear chromatin. Numerous foci of spindle-shaped cells with pleomorphic, hyperchromatic nuclei and inconspicuous nucleoli were observed. Increased mitoses (2–3 per five high-power field) were intermixed with foci of necrosis and hemorrhage. Dense connective tissue with collagen fiber bundles was also present.

Based on the H&E findings, a preliminary diagnosis of poorly differentiated round cell tumor was made. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed positive expression to CK 8/18 and CD56, and negative expression to CK20, CD45 and S-100. Based on these findings, a final diagnosis of Small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (SNEC) of the buccal mucosa was established.

Histopathological features included tightly packed round-to-ovoid cells, small in size with scanty eosinophilic cytoplasm, and hyperchromatic nuclei.
