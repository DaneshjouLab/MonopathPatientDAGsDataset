A 64-year-old female was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the lung with brain and pleural metastases and an activating EGFR mutation (common Exon 19 deletion). Treatment with afatinib was started at a dosage of 40 mg daily. Due to grade 3 rash and diarrhea, the afatinib dosage was reduced to 30 mg daily. After 8 months, the patient experienced clinically relevant tumor progression, with hemorrhagic and malignant pleural effusion, requiring regular thoracentesis. A re-biopsy and next generation sequencing revealed the known Exon 19 deletion but no treatable resistance mutation. Chemotherapy with cisplatin and pemetrexed was initiated. Staging after the second cycle of chemotherapy revealed partial remission (Figure 1B). After six cycles of chemotherapy, maintenance treatment with pemetrexed was initiated. After a few weeks, the patientâ€™s performance status worsened, and she developed progressive pleural carcinomatosis. Following 15 months of afatinib treatment, the patient developed peritoneal carcinomatosis, and a rebiopsy revealed a T790M mutation.
