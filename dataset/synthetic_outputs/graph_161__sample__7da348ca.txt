A 38-year-old female presented with enlargement of the cardiac silhouette on chest x-ray. This initial finding led to further investigation with a chest CT scan, which revealed a small lung nodule in the left upper lobe inferior lingular segment, bilateral enlargement of mediastinal lymph nodes, and significant pericardial effusion. These CT findings prompted a transbronchial tumor biopsy, which revealed clinical stage IVA (T1aN3M1a) lung adenocarcinoma. EGFR mutations and ALK translocation were not detected from the biopsy specimens. The diagnosis of stage IVA lung adenocarcinoma led to first-line chemotherapy with cisplatin, pemetrexed, and bevacizumab. After five cycles of first-line chemotherapy, the patient had a partial response and then started maintenance chemotherapy with pemetrexed and bevacizumab. A complete response was obtained after two cycles of maintenance therapy with pemetrexed and bevacizumab. Four years after the initial diagnosis, after 43 cycles of maintenance chemotherapy, a chest CT scan showed a small shadow at the primary lesion. The detection of this shadow led to a salvage partial lobectomy, which confirmed viable cancer cells in the resected specimens. ROS1 fusion transcripts and BRAF mutations were not detected from the specimens. Nine months after the operation, the lung cancer relapsed with bilateral mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, multiple bone metastases, and multiple brain metastases.
