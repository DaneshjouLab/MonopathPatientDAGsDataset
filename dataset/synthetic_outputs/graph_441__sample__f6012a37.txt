A 54-year-old female presented with a 6-month history of a painless abdominal mass that had been gradually increasing in size. Her past medical history included an appendectomy 8 years prior and a caesarean section 15 years prior. She was a non-smoker with no family history of malignancy. The patient had been a secondary school teacher her entire life and had lived in one area, with no known exposure to asbestos.

On admission, the patient was in good health with stable vital signs. Physical examination revealed a palpable, movable, painless intracavitary mass on the right side of her abdomen. There was no ascites. Initial laboratory investigations showed a white blood cell count of 13,100/mm3 (neutrophils 70.2%, lymphocytes 39.6%), hemoglobin of 12.4 g/dl, and platelets of 200,000/mm3. Creatinine was 10 mg/l, urea was 0.11 g/l, and CRP was < 6 mg/dl. An abdominal CT scan was inconclusive.

Due to the inconclusive CT scan, an exploratory laparotomy was performed. This revealed a localized, encapsulated, firm mesenteric tissue mass, weighing approximately 500 grams and measuring 12.5 x 10.5 x 8 cm. There was no evidence of inflammation, mesenteric lymph node involvement, or ascites.

Microscopic examination of the tumor showed moderately polymorphic spindle-shaped neoplastic cells with elongated, moderately pleomorphic hyperchromatic nuclei, low mitotic activity, and infiltration of connective tissue. These histopathological features were consistent with low-grade sarcomatoid malignant mesothelioma.

Immunohistochemical staining of the neoplastic cells was positive for keratin AE1/AE3 and CAM 5.2, and negative for desmin and CD34. These immunohistopathological findings further supported the diagnosis of sarcomatoid mesothelioma. The patient was subsequently referred to an oncologist for adjuvant chemotherapy.
