A 62-year-old Hispanic male with a past medical history of anxiety, tobacco use disorder (25 pack-years), chronic obstructive lung disease, and pulmonary fibrosis presented to the emergency department (ED) with one week of shortness of breath, runny nose, cough, and anterior and posterior chest wall pain. He denied fever, chills, cough, chest pain, palpitation, weight loss, or other symptoms.

Nineteen months prior to this presentation, a CT abdomen incidentally revealed a possible left lower lobe mass.

A follow-up CT chest without contrast showed a mass-like area of consolidation in the superior segment of the left lower lobe measuring 1.3 cm x 1.9 cm x 2.9 cm, pulmonary fibrosis, and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. The patient signed out against medical advice and failed to seek further medical advice until progressive worsening dyspnea prompted this ER visit.

A CT chest revealed diffuse honeycomb changes in bilateral lower lobes, right middle lobe, and peripherally along the upper lobes, as well as subpleural consolidation in the upper lobes bilaterally to the apices. CT angiography of the chest showed interval growth of the left lower lobe nodule, now 7.1 cm x 3.9 cm, compatible with malignancy, along with mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, left greater than right.

At the emergency department (ED) presentation, the patient's blood pressure was 121/63 mmHg, heart rate 105 bpm, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, temperature 36.5 degrees Celsius, and oxygen saturation 97% on room air. CT chest showed emphysematous and fibrotic changes in pulmonary parenchyma. No pneumothorax, central occlusive pulmonary embolism (PE), pulmonary arterial hypertension, right heart strain, pericardial effusion, or thoracic aortic dissection or aneurysm were noted.

Physical exam revealed mild wheezing and rales bilaterally, and mild right paraspinal muscle tenderness. Laboratory studies showed Troponin 2 pg/mL and BNP 14 pg/mL. EKG showed sinus tachycardia, with no ST or T wave changes. CXR showed diffuse interstitial opacities with a mass-like density in the left midlung zone. Ultrasound venous lower extremities was negative for acute deep venous thrombosis.

CT angiogram (CTA) of the chest revealed an age-indeterminate left lower lobe pulmonary arterial embolus (PE) and interval growth of the previously reported left lower lobe nodule/mass, now measuring 7.1 cm x 3.9 cm. There was no evidence of central occlusive PE or right heart strain. CT head, abdomen, and pelvis were negative for metastatic disease.

Complete blood count revealed: WBC 9.6 K/mm3, RBC 4.64 K/mm3, Hgb 14.4 g/dL, Hct 42.0%, MCV 90.5 fL, MCH 31.0 pg, MCHC 34.3 g/dL, RDW 12.8%, Platelets 198 K/mm3, Neutrophils 70.2%, Lymphocytes 21.4%, Monocytes 5.0%, Eosinophils 2.0%, Basophils 0.4%. Routine coagulation showed: PT 13.2 seconds, INR 1.0, PTT 33 seconds.
