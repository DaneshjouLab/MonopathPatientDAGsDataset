The patient is a current smoker with a 50-pack-year smoking history. The patient presented with bilateral lung nodules and a suspicious left adrenal gland lesion. Diagnostic biopsy showed metastatic lung adenocarcinoma; scant tissue limited PD-L1 expression. MSK IMPACT tissue platform demonstrated no targetable mutations, but was notable for TP53 and ARID1A mutations. MSK-ACCESS liquid biopsy platform was congruous with the initial tissue biopsy, but additional mutations were discovered and were notable for detectable alterations in TP53, ARID1A, KEAP1, MAP2K and SMARCA4. The patient received carboplatin, pemetrexed, and pembrolizumab with excellent clinical and complete radiological response. After four cycles of combination therapy, both carboplatin and pemetrexed were ceased and pembrolizumab was continued as maintenance therapy every 3 weeks. The patient benefitted from PD-1 blockade for more than a year, but later developed what was initially suspected to be radiological progression. Investigation with clinical examination, radiology and comprehensive molecular profiling with tissue and liquid biopsy of the new pulmonary nodule revealed an alternate explanation.
