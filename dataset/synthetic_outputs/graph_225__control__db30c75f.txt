Mesothelioma is a rare, aggressive malignant neoplasm of mesothelial origin. Inactivation of BRCA1 associated protein 1 (BAP1) is the most common pathogenetic alteration in malignant mesotheliomas. Additionally, genetic alterations in Hippo pathway genes [neurofibromatosis type 2/merlin (NF2), LATS1/2, RASSF1, SAV1], as well as SETD2, SETDB1, DDX3X, DDX51, TP53, CDKN2A, were also reported in a subset of malignant mesotheliomas. A small subset of peritoneal mesothelioma is driven by recurrent gene fusions, mostly EWSR1/FUS::ATF1 fusions, with predilection for young adults. Rare cases of peritoneal mesotheliomas, typically in children or young adults, harboring recurrent gene fusions in ALK and EWSR1/FUS::ATF1 have been reported without associated asbestos exposure. To date, only two cases of mesothelioma harboring EWSR1::YY1 fusions have been described. Moreover, an EWSR1::YY1 fusion was reported in a single case study of 2 patients with peritoneal mesothelioma.

This report presents three additional cases of EWSR1::YY1-fused peritoneal mesotheliomas, two localized and one diffuse, all occurring in the peritoneum of middle-aged adults (2 females and 1 male), and discovered incidentally by imaging or during surgery performed for unrelated reasons. These cases suggest that EWSR1::YY1-fusion defines a small subset of peritoneal epithelioid mesothelioma in middle-aged adults without history of asbestos exposure.

One patient had a remote history of osteosarcoma more than 3 decades ago that was treated with chemotherapy with complete response. Another patient has a history of hemicolectomy for an early-stage colonic adenocarcinoma 5 years ago. After the diagnosis of (malignant) mesothelioma via biopsy, one patient underwent cytoreductive surgery that included total pelvic peritonectomy to resect all gross lesions and removal of hernia mesh, followed by 4 cycles of adjuvant intraperitoneal chemotherapy (cisplatin/mitomycin).

All three patients underwent surgical resection or cytoreductive surgery of the masses. Overt mitotic activity or tumor necrosis was absent in the resected specimens. On follow-up imaging, no recurrence or progression of disease was identified.
