A 67-year-old female with a past medical history of non-small cell lung cancer status post right lower lobe lobectomy and esophageal dysphagia secondary to radiation therapy with a covered self-expandable metal stent (SEMS) placed at the proximal esophagus one year prior to admission presented to the emergency department with two days of dyspnea on exertion, nausea and vomiting for the past week, and an inability to tolerate oral intake. She had a recent hospitalization two months prior at an outside hospital for aspiration pneumonia requiring intubation. On presentation to the emergency department, she was hypoxic to 84% with tachypnea (respiratory rate 30) and was subsequently placed on BiPAP.

One day after admission, the patient was intubated for worsening hypoxia and transferred to the intensive care unit. She was mechanically intubated for one week and successfully extubated. On day four of intubation, the patient was noted to have a persistent right lower lobe opacity despite being on broad-spectrum antibiotics, and thus a bedside bronchoscopy was performed to evaluate the lungs.

Bronchoscopy revealed a 3-mm right bronchoesophageal fistula (BEF) with clear visualization of the previously placed fully covered self-expandable metal stent (SEMS) displaced towards the mid esophagus. The advanced gastrointestinal team replaced the displaced stent with a partially covered SEMS (20 mm x 10 cm) stent, positioning the proximal end 25 cm from the incisors. The patient's PEG tube was replaced with a Gastrostomy-Jejunostomy tube to facilitate feeding due to the TEF.

A repeat bronchoscopy performed the following day demonstrated resolution of the fistulous tract. The patient was unable to be weaned off mechanical ventilation successfully. Given her poor prognosis and overall debility, the family opted to make patient comfort care and perform palliative extubation.
