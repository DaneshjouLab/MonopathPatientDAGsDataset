A 39-year-old male presented with episodes of dyspnea dating back 6 months prior to hospital admission. His past medical and family histories were unremarkable. During paraclinical investigations, chest computed tomography (CT) demonstrated pleural effusion and multiple pulmonary nodules, raising the question of primary mesothelioma or metastasis from a distant focus. Histopathology and immunohistochemical examinations of a pleural biopsy provided evidence of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) of the clear cell type. An abdominal contrast computed tomography (CT) was then performed, revealing a 3 cm right renal mass, which was subsequently removed by partial nephrectomy. The patient's initial presentation of dyspnea was a rare manifestation of RCC, with the pleural involvement being particularly uncommon. The case highlights the importance of considering RCC in the differential diagnosis of dyspnea, even in the absence of typical symptoms.
