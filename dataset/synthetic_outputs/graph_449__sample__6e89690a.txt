An 81-year-old woman with a history of radiation therapy for lung cancer and receiving denosumab for over 4 years for multiple bone metastases presented with swelling in the upper jaw. Clinical examination revealed swelling in the right maxilla and bone exposure with pain in the maxillary right first molar extraction socket. A CT scan showed osteolysis of the right maxilla with maxillary sinusitis, periosteal reaction in the posterior wall of the maxillary sinus, and osteosclerosis of the zygomatic bone. Based on these findings, she was diagnosed with stage 3 medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ).

The patient underwent 6 months of conservative treatment, including rinsing with an antimicrobial agent, administration of antibiotics, and lavage of the socket. Despite this treatment, osteolysis of the maxillary bone progressed, and fistula formation was observed in the cheek. Due to the progression, resection of the bony sequestrum and debridement of the fistula were performed under general anesthesia. Histopathological examination revealed sequestration with granulation tissue and abscess formation. Bacterial culture of the fistular secretions grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Eight months after surgery, CT showed [incomplete data].
