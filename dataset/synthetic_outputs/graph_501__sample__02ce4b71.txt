A 54-year-old Japanese man presented for evaluation of a ground glass opacity (GGO) found incidentally within the right upper lung on computed tomography (CT). Chest CT showed a pure GGO lesion measuring 8 mm in diameter in the anterior segment of the right upper lobe. The patient quit smoking approximately 15 years previously and regularly saw a family doctor for chronic gastritis.

The patient had laboratory workup for tumor markers (carcinoembryonic antigen, squamous cell carcinoma antigen, cytokeratin 19 fragment) which were unremarkable. Suspicion of slow-growing early-stage non-small cell lung cancer arose.

The patient underwent segmentectomy (anterior segment of the right upper lobe) via video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.

Pathologic examination of the resected specimen showed thickening of the alveolar septum caused by the proliferation of capillary vessels without cytological atypia.

Immunohistochemistry of resected specimen was negative for thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) and cytokeratin, and positive for CD31 and CD34. The final diagnosis was SPCH (solid papillary capillary hemangioma).

The patientâ€™s postoperative course was uneventful. A chest CT showed a pure ground glass opacity, with a maximum diameter of 8 mm, located in the subpleural area of the right upper lung.

The ground glass opacity (GGO) found incidentally within the right upper lung on computed tomography (CT) was the same lesion as before.
