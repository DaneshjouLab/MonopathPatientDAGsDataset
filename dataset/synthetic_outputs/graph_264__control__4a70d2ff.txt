A 60-year-old male presented with nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). He initially showed an excellent response to NSCLC treatment. Later, he showed signs of peritoneal disease on Flourine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (<sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT) imaging, which subsequently led to the diagnosis of peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) with histopathology from peritoneal biopsy. The PC presented with FDG-avid ascites and a soft tissue mass in the pelvic area. The abdominal-pelvic lesions were confirmed cytologically to be peritoneal metastatic disease. <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT was useful in preoperatively directing biopsy for diagnosing PC and in monitoring disease progression, thus influencing management.
