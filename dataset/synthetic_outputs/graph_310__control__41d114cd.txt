A 41-year-old male construction worker with no history of smoking sought medical attention on October 21, 2021, for a cough that had lasted for 1 month, without hemoptysis, and with slight chest discomfort. Enhanced CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed a tumor in the right middle lobe of the lung (4.5 cm × 5.6 cm) with metastasis to the right hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes, as well as a mass in the greater curvature of the stomach (3.2 cm × 1 cm) and multiple lymph node metastases in the abdomen. PET-CT showed the following: (1) peripheral type lung cancer in the right middle lobe with multiple lymph node metastases in the mediastinum and right hilar region, as well as lung metastasis in the left upper lobe and rib metastasis in the 9th rib on the left side. (2) Obstructive inflammation and atelectasis in the right middle lobe of the lung. (3) Malignant tumor in the greater curvature of the stomach with multiple lymph node metastases in the abdomen. Thirty-five days after the initial visit, the patient experienced worsening vomiting symptoms and melena. A follow-up CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed gastric body greater curvature side and right middle abdomen intestinal mass, resulting in secondary intestinal obstruction and intussusception, as well as multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the abdominal and retroperitoneal regions, suggesting small bowel metastasis based on the patient’s history.
