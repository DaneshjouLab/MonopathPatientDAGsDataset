A patient presented with chest pain and shortness of breath. Further investigation revealed a diagnosis of left lower lobe small cell lung cancer. The patient also had iron deficiency anaemia, likely related to the malignancy. The small cell lung cancer was further characterized as a small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. The disease progressed, resulting in lung metastasis and gastrointestinal metastasis, which led to gastrointestinal bleeding and ultimately, bowel perforation. The case highlights the aggressive nature of small cell lung cancer and its potential for widespread metastasis.
