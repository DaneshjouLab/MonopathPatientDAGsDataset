A patient presented with a complex clinical course involving both oncological and infectious processes. The patient was diagnosed with lung cancer, specifically non-small cell lung cancer of the squamous cell carcinoma subtype. The patient initially experienced exertional dyspnea and shoulder pain, suggestive of the underlying malignancy. The lung cancer progressed, leading to pleural effusion and lymphadenopathy, indicative of metastasis. The patient experienced progressive disease despite treatment.

Further complicating the clinical picture, the patient developed herpes zoster, which subsequently generalized, manifesting as exanthema and vesicles. A subcutaneous nodule was identified, revealing a hypoechoic mass, which was confirmed as cutaneous metastasis of squamous cell carcinoma. The patient also developed radiation pulmonary inflammation, likely secondary to treatment for the lung cancer.

The patient's condition continued to deteriorate, culminating in respiratory failure and progressive lung cancer. Recurrent pleural effusions were noted throughout the course of the illness. The patient's history of solid tumors and hematological cancer suggests a compromised immune system, predisposing them to the generalized herpes zoster infection. The patient experienced multiple episodes of herpes zoster. The lung cancer ultimately progressed, leading to further complications and a poor outcome.
