A 46-year-old African American woman with HIV on antiretroviral therapy presented with progressively worsening dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle swelling, and NYHA class 3 symptoms for 2 weeks prior to admission. Examination revealed tachycardia, normotension, hypoxemia, distant heart sounds, a palpable left supraclavicular lymph node, and multiple axillary lymph nodes.

The patient developed tenderness in her right calf. Her white blood cell count was minimally elevated at 13500 cells/mm3 with 78% neutrophils. D-Dimer was elevated at 20 \u00b5g/mL FEU (normal range: 0.00-0.48 \u00b5g/mL FEU). A chest radiograph showed cardiomegaly with no acute infiltrate.

An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia. An echocardiogram revealed moderate pericardial effusion with a normal ejection fraction. Troponin was elevated at 0.286 ng/mL (normal range: 0.0-0.034 ng/mL). Pericardiocentesis drained serosanguinous fluid with normal white blood cells count and negative gram staining.

Venous Doppler of the right lower extremity revealed a deep vein thrombosis, and the patient was started on a heparin drip. A chest computed tomography (CT) angiogram showed no pulmonary embolism but revealed right paratracheal adenopathy, a right hilar mass, and subcarinal nodes. CT of the abdomen/pelvis showed bilateral breast masses, bilateral pleural effusions, bilateral adrenal nodules, and vertebral translucency. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed two lesions, one in the cerebellum and one in the left frontal lobe, consistent with metastasis.

The patient's absolute CD4 count was 116 cells/\u00b5L (normal range: 500-1750 cells/\u00b5L), CD4 cells percentage was 7% (normal range: 30-61), and T-lymphocyte CD4/CD8 ratio was 0.11 (normal range: 0.86-5.00). The patient was started on prophylactic antibiotics with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in addition to her antiretroviral treatment. Excision biopsy of the supraclavicular lymph node was consistent with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma with a mucin stain positive, immune staining using TTF-1 (thyroid transcription factor-1) positive and GATA-3 negative. Pericardial fluid studies showed malignant large epithelioid cells, favoring metastatic adenocarcinoma.

The patient experienced continued worsening dyspnea, prompting further drainage of her re-accumulating pericardial fluid with a pericardial window.

The patient expired as a result of her decompensating status.
