The patient's case began with a restaging CT scan 5 months after surgery, which revealed an enlarged right paratracheal node (4R) increasing in short axis diameter from 2.2 cm. Twenty-three days after undergoing EBUS-TBNA, the patient presented to the emergency department with hypotension, elevated leukocyte count, lactate, creatinine, and liver enzymes. The patient was not in respiratory distress and was in room air. A chest X-ray revealed new opacities in the left lower lung field, leading to a diagnosis of pneumosepsis. The patient subsequently developed unstable, narrow complex tachycardia. A bedside echocardiogram diagnosed a large pericardial effusion and features of tamponade. Emergent pericardiocentesis was performed with insertion of a pericardial drain and evacuation of 350 mL of purulent fluid. Pericardial fluid cytology was negative, but cultures grew Streptococcus mitis-group, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Prevotella melaninogenica, and Lancefieldella rimae. A repeat CT scan of the chest revealed a large loculated rim-enhancing fluid collection within the mediastinum and pericardium, with multiple internal locules of gas and thickening with enhancement in the pericardium and mediastinal soft tissue. The patient developed progressive septic shock due to the inability to obtain source control. The mediastinal fluid collection was not amenable to drainage via interventional radiology. HRCT of the chest at the level of the aortic arch demonstrated a large loculated fluid collection within the mediastinum, with the necrotic station 4R appearing indistinguishable from the collection. HRCT of the chest at the level of the carina showed visible mediastinal gas and loculations. HRCT of the chest also showed multiple internal locules of gas within the pericardial effusion, and HRCT of the lower chest demonstrated pericardial thickening and bilateral pleural effusions. After consulting with cardiac surgery, the benefit-to-risk ratio of sternotomy and surgical drainage was deemed limited. The patient opted for palliative measures and passed away surrounded by her family.
