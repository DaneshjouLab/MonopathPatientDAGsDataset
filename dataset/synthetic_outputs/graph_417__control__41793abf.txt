A 68-year-old Asian male, lifelong non-smoker with a 30-year history of psoriasis previously successfully treated with UVB phototherapy, was diagnosed with recurrent NSCLC. He originally presented with left upper lobe Stage IIB (pT3 (7.8cm) N0 (0/12)) adenocarcinoma at the age of 66, underwent lobectomy and received four cycles of adjuvant cisplatin and vinorelbine. One year after adjuvant chemotherapy, surveillance imaging identified multifocal ground glass nodules in lungs bilaterally, which showed interval growth over multiple scans. Molecular characterization identified an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 19 deletion.

First-line osimertinib 80 mg daily was started one-and-half years after completion of adjuvant chemotherapy. Within two weeks, the patient had significant worsening of his pre-existing scaly psoriatic plaques with desquamation over his face, trunk, upper and lower extremities, including inflammation of his fingertips with intermittent abdominal pain. Osimertinib was held, and Dermatology prescribed hydrocortisone cream and UVB phototherapy, given the patient's previous success receiving these treatments for his psoriasis. Despite this, his rash worsened, and four weeks after osimertinib was held, he developed a temperature of 39.5Â°C with tachycardia and worsening abdominal pain. He was admitted to hospital, infection was ruled out, and skin toxicity was deemed psoriasis worsened by osimertinib potentially with associated dermatitis. After hospital discharge, he commenced a 10-week course of UVB phototherapy with 90% clearance of skin lesions.

Osimertinib was restarted at 40 mg daily, after completion of phototherapy, five months since his last dose. Within three days, he developed fever, tachycardia, widespread skin desquamation and swelling.
