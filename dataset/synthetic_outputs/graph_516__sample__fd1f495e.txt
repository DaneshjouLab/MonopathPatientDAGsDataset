In March 2019, a 54-year-old woman with an ECOG score of 1 presented with hoarseness and cough without an obvious cause. An enhanced chest CT scan revealed a nodule in the left upper lobe and mediastinal lymph node metastases in the pulmonary artery. Bronchoscopy confirmed a pathological diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma. Brain MRI and whole-body bone scan showed no metastatic disease, leading to a preliminary staging of cT2N2M0 IIIA. The patient was then enrolled in a phase III clinical trial evaluating sintilimab as consolidation therapy for unresectable, locally advanced NSCLC (stage III) without disease progression after radical CCRT.

The patient received two cycles of induction chemotherapy which ended in May 2019, followed by CCRT which ended in July 2019. CCRT consisted of 30 fractions of 2.0 Gy each, for a total of 60.0 Gy. The mean lung dose (MLD) was 13.5 Gy, with 17% of the lung receiving a dose of 20 Gy (V20) and 53% of the lung receiving a dose of 5 Gy (V5). A chest CT after CCRT showed a partial response (PR) with a 30.3% lesion reduction.

The patient then received consolidation sintilimab every 3 weeks. Three months after RT, during the third cycle of sintilimab treatment, the patient experienced pneumonitis with a slight cough, with imaging showing consolidation in the left lower lobe. Pneumonitis was diagnosed as a mild form of grade II RP.
