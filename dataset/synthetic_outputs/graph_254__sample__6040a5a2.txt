A 53-year-old man from the Mediterranean coast area, diagnosed with extended stage 4 lung adenocarcinoma (pT1bN2M+, Non-mutated EGFR, ALK, ROS, PDL1 negative), was admitted with fever, fatigue, and prolonged pancytopenia. This occurred three weeks after his first cycle of maintenance chemotherapy with pemetrexed (500 mg/m2), following four cycles of chemotherapy combining cis-platinum and pemetrexed. He had no significant past medical history, no blood transfusions, and no recent travel abroad. His ECOG performance status was 1, Body Mass Index (BMI) was 27, and Body Surface Area (BSA) was 2.

Physical examination revealed pallor and moderate splenomegaly, but no peripheral lymphadenopathy or skin lesions. Laboratory studies, conducted after filgrastim injections (5 Âµg/kg daily for 10 days), showed a white-cell count of 1600/mm3, neutrophile count of 570/mm3, eosinophil count of 0/mm3, platelet count of 70,000/mm3, hemoglobin level of 7.7 g/dL, MCV 83 fl, MCH 26.1 pg, and a C reactive protein (CRP) test result of 105.3 mg/L.

Further investigations revealed normal renal and liver function tests, blood glucose, electrolytes, serum ferritin, and iron levels. Plasma levels for vitamin B12 and folate were also normal, at 253 pmole/L and 27.1 nmole/L, respectively. Blood cultures and tests for SARS-CoV-2 and HIV were negative, and cytomegalovirus infection was ruled out. Bone marrow aspiration cytology revealed normal trilineage hematopoiesis, but Leishmania amastigotes were observed both outside and within the cytoplasm of a macrophage.

Based on these findings, a diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis was confirmed by PCR testing on stained slides with May-Grunwald Giemsa (MGG). Consequently, maintenance chemotherapy was suspended.
