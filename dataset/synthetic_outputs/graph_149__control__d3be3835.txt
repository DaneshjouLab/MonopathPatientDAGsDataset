A 21-year-old Chinese male with no personal smoking history or family medical history was diagnosed with advanced lung adenocarcinoma and brain metastases. The patient's disease progressed after two lines of chemotherapy. A liquid biopsy identified a low abundance (0.03%) EML4-ALK rearrangement in plasma ctDNA. The patient was then treated with alectinib and demonstrated a durable complete response (>13 months), including complete resolution of metastatic brain tumors. This case highlights the efficacy of alectinib in ALK+ NSCLC, even with low variant allele abundance, and reinforces the utility of NGS-based genomic sequencing of liquid biopsy in guiding clinical practice.
