A 39-year-old female Chinese non-smoker presented with an incidentally detected left mid-zone chest opacity on X-ray. CT-guided biopsy confirmed EGFR exon-21 mutation-positive adenocarcinoma (EGFR p.Leu858Arg). Subsequently, the patient experienced partial seizures involving her left leg. MRI revealed at least nine cerebral metastases, including right frontal and parietal, bilateral temporal and left lentiform nucleus masses. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of metastatic EGFR mutation-positive lung adenocarcinoma, stage IVB (T2aN1M1c) was made. The patient was started on erlotinib 150 mg daily and dexamethasone 2 mg daily, along with antiepileptic therapy with phenytoin. Approximately 5 weeks into treatment, the patient re-presented with elevated liver enzymes, leading to cessation of erlotinib and a switch from phenytoin to brivaracetam. Ten days after the medication change, the patient developed intermittent left facial twitching, followed by hypogeusia the next day, and then left and right facial droop the following day, resulting in inability to close her eyes, dysarthria, and drooling. Cranial nerve examination demonstrated complete (House-Brackmann grade VI) weakness of all branches of the left facial nerve and severe (House-Brackmann grade V) weakness of the right facial nerve with hypogeusia on direct testing. No hypoacusis or hyperacusis was noted and no other cranial nerve, peripheral neurological or cerebellar abnormality seen. Bilateral facial nerve palsy was suspected.
