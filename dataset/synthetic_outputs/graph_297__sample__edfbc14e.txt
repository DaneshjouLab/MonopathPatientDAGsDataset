The patient initially achieved remission and a no-disease state following treatment for Hodgkin's Lymphoma (HL). However, the patient subsequently experienced a second relapse of HL. Following this second relapse, the yearly probability of death from HL was 10.1% over 10 years (rate = 0.00886, 95% CI: 0.00571-0.01373). Patients are considered cured 10 years after this second relapse. Regarding secondary cancer risks, there is no excess risk for breast cancer for the first 5 years after treatment for Hodgkin's Lymphoma. Thereafter, the excess relative risk per gray (ERR/Gy) depends on age at treatment: <19 years, ERR/Gy = 0.257; 20-24 years, ERR/Gy = 0.097; 25-29 years, ERR/Gy = 0.057; 30-34 years, ERR/Gy = 0.043; >34 years, ERR/Gy = 0.030 with RR = 1 + (ERR/Gy × MBD × 1.608). Similarly, there is no excess risk for lung cancer for the first 5 years after treatment for Hodgkin's Lymphoma. Thereafter, the excess relative risk per gray (ERR/Gy) is 0.15 (95% CI: 0.06-0.39) with RR=1+(ERR/ Gy × MLD × 1·672*).
