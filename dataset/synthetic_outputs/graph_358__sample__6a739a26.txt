A 62-year-old man, diagnosed in 2020 with T2N3M1b adenocarcinoma subtype NSCLC, KRASG12C mutant, and programmed death-ligand 1 positive at 2%, with no relevant previous comorbidities, no previous history of liver disease, hepatitis, or alcohol abuse, and positive for cytomegalovirus immunoglobulin G, was initially treated with carboplatin-pemetrexed-pembrolizumab. Following cycle 1 of maintenance pembrolizumab-pemetrexed, he experienced mediastinal progression and received palliative thoracic radiotherapy (20 Gy in 5 fractions). CPI therapy had not previously caused hepatotoxicity, and he had no immune-related AEs worse than grade 1. In March 2021, 14 weeks after the last dose of pembrolizumab, he commenced second-line sotorasib, 960 mg once daily, on compassionate supply prelicense, after a discussion of risks and alternatives. Baseline liver function tests before starting sotorasib were within the reference range. On cycle 1 day 12, he developed grade 2 alkaline phosphatase (ALP), grade 1 bilirubin, and grade 3 ALT rise, and sotorasib was held. Bilirubin, ALT, and ALP worsened rapidly in subsequent days, requiring commencement of 60 mg oral prednisolone on day 15 and hospitalization. Liver ultrasonography, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, and comprehensive acute viral serologic and molecular testing identified no other causes of hepatotoxicity, including extensive testing for hepatitis A/B/C/E and a broad autoimmune antibody panel. He was positive for Epsteinâ€“Barr virus immunoglobulin G and detection at low-level with polymerase chain reaction (346 IU/mL).
