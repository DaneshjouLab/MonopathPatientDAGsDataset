A 72-year-old man receiving alectinib for ALK-positive NSCLC presented with ground-glass opacity in the lungs detected via computed tomography. This raised suspicion of drug-induced lung injury from alectinib. Alectinib was discontinued, and steroids were initiated.

The lung injury showed improvement, and alectinib was switched to lorlatinib 100 mg/d. Renal and liver function were normal at the time of switching.

Four days after lorlatinib initiation, the patient experienced auditory hallucinations, followed by visual hallucinations 3 days later. He was diagnosed with a grade 2-3 CNS disorder. Concomitant medications included vonoprazan fumarate (10 mg/d), calcium carbonate/cholecalciferol/magnesium carbonate mixture (2 tablets/d), rosuvastatin calcium (2.5 mg/d), aspirin (100 mg/d), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole mixture (1 tablets/d), magnesium oxide (990 mg/d), prednisolone (10 mg/d), and torasemide (4 mg/d).

Lorlatinib was discontinued the day after the onset of visual hallucinations. Visual and auditory hallucinations persisted for a further 3 days before disappearing on day 4 after discontinuation.

Lorlatinib was restarted at 50 mg/d on day 5 after discontinuation, and the visual and auditory hallucinations reappeared the following day. Visual hallucinations were less powerful, and auditory hallucinations were about half as loud as before. The specific visual hallucinations included curtains approaching him up close.
