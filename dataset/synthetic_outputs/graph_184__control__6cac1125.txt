An 80-year-old immunocompetent African-American man presented with progressively worsening dyspnea, productive cough, nocturnal sweating, anorexia, and three-month weight loss after returning from a month-long stay in Arizona. He noted that approximately 6 months before admission, he had a COVID-19 infection that did not require hospitalization. The patient was admitted with a subacute cough, progressively worsening shortness of breath, significant weight loss, nodular skin lesions in upper extremities, and acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. On arrival, the patient exhibited signs of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure with an oxygen saturation of 85% on room air. Physical examination revealed bilateral basal crackles on auscultation of the lungs, yet no wheezing or use of accessory muscles was noted. The patient was diagnosed with disseminated coccidioidomycosis. Coccidioidomycosis is a fungal infection primarily Endemic in the Southwest United States. Disseminated Coccidioidomycosis is a life-threatening variant that mainly occurs in an immunocompromised host. What sets this case apart is the significant endotracheal and endobronchial involvement, which mimicked metastatic lung cancer.
