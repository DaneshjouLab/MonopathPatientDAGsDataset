On April 8, 2019, a 56-year-old woman visited the hospital for a chronic persistent cough. On April 9, 2019, a lymph node biopsy was performed under ultrasound guidance, and the pathologic results showed small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Later, on April 15, 2019, positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) showed positive lesions in the right lower lobe, mediastinal soft tissue, left lower lobe, bilateral hilum, and other sites. According to American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)/Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) 8th Tumor Node Metastasis (TNM) staging classification, the patient was initially diagnosed with extensive small cell lung carcinoma (ES-SCLC), which was defined as clinical stage T2aN3M1 and Siewert type IV.

From April 2019 to May 2019, the patient received 2 cycles of EP chemotherapy regimen with etoposide 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 1–3 and cisplatin 25 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 1–3 in each 3-week period. After 2 cycles of chemotherapy, the efficacy was evaluated as partial response (PR). Further pathology showed a low differentiated carcinoma, consistent with adenocarcinoma, with the possibility of complex carcinoma. Additional lung cancer common genetic testing with next-generation sequencing (NGS) indicated fusion of EML4 and ALK.

Therefore, the diagnosis was modified to terminal SCLC in the lower lobe of the right lung (cT2aN3M0, IIIB) and ALK mutation adenocarcinoma of the lower lobe of the left lung (cT4N2M0 IIIB, ALK mutation). According to the NCCN and Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology (CSCO) guidelines in 2019, the treatment plan was reformulated to include: 1) oral targeted drug treatment (crizotinib, 250 mg bid.); 2) continuous EP chemotherapy regimen; and 3) sequential radiotherapy (from July 19 to August 23, 2019).
