A 64-year-old nonsmoking woman presented on September 10, 2014, with sudden glossolalia and right lower limb numbness and was diagnosed with stage IIIA lung adenocarcinoma. On September 24, 2014, she underwent resection of the upper lobe and received pemetrexed combined with carboplatin for four cycles of chemotherapy. In November 2015, the disease progressed. From November 11, 2015, to March 11, 2016, the patient was given paclitaxel plus cisplatin combined with bevacizumab for six cycles. From April 1, 2016, to April 26, 2019, the patient received pemetrexed combined with bevacizumab, and her condition remained stable. On April 26, 2019, she visited the hospital for further treatment due to intolerance of side effects from previous chemotherapy for lung adenocarcinoma, including myelosuppression and cardiac and renal insufficiency. Chest CT showed bone metastases in the thoracolumbar spine and bilateral local ribs, nodules in both lungs, and pericardial and left pleural effusion. After the last cycle of treatment with pemetrexed plus bevacizumab, CT showed bone metastases in the thoracolumbar spine and bilateral local ribs, nodules in both lungs, and pericardial and left pleural effusion. NGS analysis showed EGFR G724S [mutant allele frequency (MAF): 67.59%] mutation in exon 18 and R776H (MAF: 40.54%) mutation in exon 20 as well as amplification. The patient was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma with rare EGFR G724S and R776H mutations and amplification.
