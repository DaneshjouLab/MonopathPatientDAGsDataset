        "content": "66-year-old female, never smoker, admitted in October 2022 with shortness of breath, productive cough without fever and chill. ECOG performance status of 1. Physical examination revealed saturation of 88 % on ambient air and dullness in the lower lung fields on left chest percussion. Contrast enhanced chest CT revealed a 35 x 30 mm mass in the left upper lung with enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes. Massive pleural fluid on the left side. Thoracocentesis performed, and cytology revealed malignant cells, indicating tumor progression involving pleura. PET-CT showed increased 18F-FDG uptake of the left upper lung mass with a SUVmax of 15.49. PET-CT scan indicated intensive 18F-FDG hypermetabolism in the left pleura nodules (SUVmax = 12.03) and left mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes (SUVmax = 9.66). Lung mass biopsy confirmed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with positive staining for CK7 (3+), TTF-1 (3+) and Ki67 (70 %). Tumor cells were negative for programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1). NGS showed the presence of KIF5B-RET rearrangement in both lung biopsy tissue and pleural effusion samples. Concurrent genetic aberrance was a missense mutation in TP53. The NGS testing also revealed a tumor mutation burden (TMB) of 1.25 Muts/Mb. Patient was diagnosed stage IV (T2aN2M1a) lung adenocarcinoma with a RET rearrangement. The patient started on Pralsetinib treatment with the recommended dosage of 400 mg once daily.",
