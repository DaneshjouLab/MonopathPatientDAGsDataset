A 65-year-old Caucasian male, diagnosed with Stage 3B (T3 N3 M0) squamous cell carcinoma of the right upper lobe (RUL) three years earlier, was found on surveillance sequential Computed Tomography (CT) scans to have an interval increase in a residual right hilar mass and regional lymph nodes. He had been experiencing worsening exertional dyspnoea and intermittent haemoptysis over several months. He denied constitutional symptoms. Clinical examination revealed a mild-moderate bilateral expiratory wheeze and oxygen saturations within normal parameters (SpO2 = 96 % on room air). The patient presented for initial evaluation with suspected tumour recurrence. After bronchoscopic biopsies, he was found to have squamous metaplasia with the formation of a bronchial stricture and focal endobronchial nodules; both outcomes are likely secondary to radiation therapy. Radiation therapy can cause delayed injury to the lung parenchyma resulting in a spectrum of changes from radiation pneumonitis to radiation fibrosis. Clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic, mild and rarely severe respiratory symptoms. Central airway injury secondary to radiation therapy is less well documented, but can present as tracheobronchial squamous metaplasia, which may impair mucociliary clearance and rarely itself undergo neoplastic transformation. Radiation exposure may also result in the formation of tracheobronchial strictures and stenosis.
