A patient developed altered mental status and right-sided weakness after premedication with ondansetron and dexamethasone. On physical examination, an altered mental status and right-sided weakness were observed, while hemodynamic and respiratory stability were maintained, but exhibiting reduced mobility on the right side, accompanied by right facial paresis. Bloodwork revealed significant hyponatremia (116 mEq/L), suggesting Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion (SIADH), despite this suspicion, there was no further investigation to confirm this diagnosis due to rapid symptom reversal after biperiden administration, implicating an adverse reaction to ondansetron. Five days after the first episode, shortly after the administration of 4 mg intravenous ondansetron for nausea before breakfast, the patient again developed altered mental status, responsive only to pain stimuli, with marked somnolence, anisocoria, central facial paresis, and severe dysarthria. A second episode of altered mental status, anisocoria, facial paresis, and severe dysarthria occurred following ondansetron administration. However, on this occasion, the blood gas analysis revealed significant hyponatremia.
