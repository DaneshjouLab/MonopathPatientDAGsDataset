A case of alectinib-induced pneumonitis is reported. The patient was diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), specifically lung adenocarcinoma. Initial presentation included a mass with invasion of the mediastinum and satellite nodules, exhibiting hypermetabolic activity on imaging. A lung lesion was identified, indicating metastasis. The patient also had a history of bipolar disorder.

The patient experienced dyspnea and chest pain. Imaging revealed ground-glass opacities. The patient was treated with alectinib. Initially, the patient achieved a partial response to the treatment. However, the patient developed pneumonitis, which was initially suspected to be a bacterial infection. Despite treatment, the patient experienced tumor progression. A second partial response was observed, but ultimately, the patient experienced progression of the disease. The patient also developed hyperlipidemia. Throughout the treatment course, the patient experienced multiple episodes of pneumonitis.
