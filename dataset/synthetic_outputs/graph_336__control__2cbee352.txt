A patient presented with lung adenocarcinoma, which subsequently metastasized. The metastases were observed as bone metastases affecting the vertebral bodies and long bones, including the femur. Specifically, a femoral lesion was identified in the right proximal femur. Imaging revealed signal hypointensity on T1-weighted imaging and signal hyperintensity on T2-weighted imaging within the bone marrow. Trabecular changes were noted, indicative of intertrabecular metastasis (ITM). The ITM presented as rod-shaped ITM, characterized by rod-shaped uptake. Further investigation of the lung adenocarcinoma revealed it to be invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma, evidenced by pulmonary nodules and nodules in the right lung, along with involvement of hilar lymph nodes. Histological examination showed cuboidal tumour cells with enlarged nuclei and abundant intracytoplasmic mucin. The patient also developed brain metastases. The tumour growth led to further bone metastasis.
