A 60-year-old man was diagnosed with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). In March 2013, the patient underwent extrapleural pneumonectomy. Pathological staging revealed pStageIII (pT3N0M0) with an epithelioid histological subtype. The patient received one cycle of adjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin and PEM, but it was discontinued due to a Grade 2 increase in creatinine level. Creatinine level decreased but remained slightly high (1.2 mg/dL) in December 2016. Peritoneal dissemination was observed. The patient was treated with nivolumab and showed a clinical response. The patient experienced nivolumab-induced immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and received repeated treatment with glucocorticoids. The patient was then treated with vinorelbine (25mg/m2) for 11 cycles, and stable disease (SD) was achieved. In December 2017, new metastases were identified in the left pleural region. The patient was treated with PEM, received four cycles of PEM treatment with stable disease (SD), then experienced disease progression.
