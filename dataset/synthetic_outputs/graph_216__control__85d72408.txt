A 63-year-old male with a past medical history of heavy tobacco use presented to the emergency department complaining of shortness of breath, palpitations, and cough. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is widely considered to be the most prevalent cardiac arrhythmia with an incidence of roughly 1%-2% in the United States alone. The incidence of AF has been known to increase with advancing age and thus presents a significant burden on healthcare systems across the globe. AF arises as a result of several mechanisms including structural changes that occur in the heart over time. Hypertension has been well-documented to cause an increased risk of developing AF. Long-standing hypertension causes many deleterious effects on the heart including left ventricular hypertrophy resulting in diastolic heart dysfunction. Over time, elevated pressures in the left ventricle can cause left atrial dilation and remodeling which has been known to play a significant role in the development of AF. AF most frequently arises as a result of ectopic beats that originate in the pulmonary veins. The left atrium and pulmonary veins are anatomically continuous structures. As a result, left atrial dilation has major effects on the adjacent pulmonary veins. A much rarer cause of atrial fibrillation includes masses in the mediastinum.
