A case report describes a patient with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who developed peripheral neurotoxicity as a result of treatment with albumin-bound paclitaxel. Albumin-bound paclitaxel is frequently used in various cancer treatments, including NSCLC, due to its strong targeting capability and low toxicity. However, peripheral neuropathy is a common adverse event induced by paclitaxel, potentially requiring drug modification or discontinuation. Symptoms of peripheral neuropathy depend on the types of neurons (sensory, motor, or autonomic neurons) affected. The mechanism of neuronal injury may be due to altered microtubule dynamics, mitochondrial malfunction, and inflammation of peripheral neurons. The patient's symptoms of peripheral neurotoxicity induced by albumin-bound paclitaxel were alleviated by a regimen containing liposomal paclitaxel, cisplatin, and tislelizumab. This suggests that this regimen may be a potential therapeutic option for managing peripheral neurotoxicity induced by albumin-bound paclitaxel in NSCLC patients.
