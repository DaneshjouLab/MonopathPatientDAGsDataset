A case report describes an uncommon presentation of lung adenocarcinoma as a skull mass in an elderly male patient. The patient presented with a progressively enlarging and painful skull mass. Initial imaging revealed a 5 cm soft tissue mass at the dorsal midline of the parietal-occipital bone. The patient had not reviewed the results of the CT scan before coming to the USA. His past medical history was significant for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with a social history of 40-pack-year smoking.

Given the rapid growth of the head mass and the imaging findings, the initial differential diagnosis considered metastatic disease and multiple myeloma. Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) was negative. Consequently, the patient was started on levetiracetam to prevent seizures and referred to the neurosurgery department for further evaluation and management. Subsequent imaging identified a lung mass, and a biopsy of the skull bone confirmed that the mass was metastatic adenocarcinoma originating from the lung. The CT scan revealed a soft tissue mass measuring 39 x 32 mm located at the dorsal midline of the parietal-occipital bone.

For treatment, the patient underwent occipital partial resection of the mass, followed by wire mesh cranioplasty. Chemotherapy and external beam radiotherapy were administered to alleviate symptoms and control the spread of cancer. Lung carcinoma with distant metastasis is generally associated with a poorer prognosis. However, some supporting data suggest that early detection and aggressive management play crucial roles in preventing further metastasis and improving the patient's quality of life and overall survival rate.
