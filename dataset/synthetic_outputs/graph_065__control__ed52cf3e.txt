A patient with biphasic malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) presented with advanced disease. The patient was initially treated with first-line immunotherapy consisting of nivolumab plus ipilimumab. The patient exhibited a unique response pattern: a brisk response was observed in pleural and mediastinal sites of disease, but rapid progression occurred in osseous/soft tissue sites, complicated by pathologic spinal cord compression. Pathologic findings from a bony metastasis at progression revealed pure epithelioid histology, lacking any evidence of sarcomatoid differentiation. Next-generation sequencing of this specimen identified a *BRAF* V600E mutation. Subsequently, the patient was treated with dabrafenib plus trametinib, resulting in ongoing clinical and imaging response in all sites of the disease, including the bones.
