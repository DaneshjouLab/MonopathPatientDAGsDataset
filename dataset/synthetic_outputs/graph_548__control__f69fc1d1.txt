A patient with lung adenocarcinoma received adjuvant atezolizumab therapy, followed by surgery and chemotherapy. Later, the patient developed liver and brain metastases during adjuvant atezolizumab therapy. A craniotomy was performed to resect a brain metastasis, which was pathologically diagnosed as small cell lung cancer (SCLC). He subsequently received platinum‐based chemotherapy with durvalumab, resulting in sustained regression of the liver metastases. This case demonstrates a metastatic brain tumor-acquired resistance to atezolizumab through histologic transformation from adenocarcinoma to SCLC. This case illustrates SCLC transformation as acquired resistance to atezolizumab, with the primary lung tumor and metastatic brain tumor, both surgically resected, histologically confirmed as adenocarcinoma and SCLC, respectively. Therefore, rebiopsy is needed if recurrent disease appears during immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment in patients with non‐small cell lung cancer.
