A 39-year-old never smoker Caucasian woman presented with a 3-month history of gradual onset of dyspnoea, cough, and left-sided pleuritic pain. A thorax CT scan revealed a 52×61×62-mm mass in the left upper lobe of the lung. This led to a diagnosis of Stage IV adenocarcinoma of the lung with bone, liver, and left adrenal distant metastases. Molecular analysis of a lung biopsy detected an EML4-ALK translocation via fluorescent in situ hybridisation.

The patient was initially treated with crizotinib, resulting in a partial response in the lung primary tumour and stable disease at the metastatic sites after 5 months of therapy. However, 9 months from crizotinib initiation, the patient progressed with an increase in the number and size of the liver metastases, and crizotinib was discontinued.

Subsequently, the patient was treated with ceritinib followed by alectinib successively. After failure of ALK inhibitors, the patient received six cycles of carboplatin and pemetrexed, resulting in short-term disease stabilisation. A repeat biopsy of the liver metastasis revealed a G to A point mutation in exon 23 of the ALK gene, resulting in G1202R substitution of the ALK tyrosine kinase receptor, using Ion AmpliSeq Targeted Sequencing Technology.
