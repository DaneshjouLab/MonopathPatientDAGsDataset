A 65-year-old man with a history of stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (treated with chemotherapy, without evidence of residual viable malignancy) presented with sore throat and mild pain in the right upper arm. He was treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for 3 days. His condition evolved to exhibiting mild leukocytosis, elevated C-reactive protein (14.6 mg/L), acute azotemia (creatinine level 4.0 mg/dL), a normal body temperature (36.6°C), unremarkable chest radiography, and confirmed influenza A virus infection via nasal swab. While being treated for influenza A with talniflumate, the patient developed a fever of 38.6°C and complained of aggravating pain and weakness in the right upper arm. Intravenous ceftriaxone was initiated. MRI of the brain revealed no metastatic or ischemic lesions. FDG PET/CT revealed hypermetabolic lesions in the retropharyngeal space with a maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of 9.8, involving the vertebral bodies (VBs) of the C4 and C5 vertebrae and prevertebral spaces of the T1–T4 vertebrae. Further imaging and cultures revealed continuous hypermetabolic lesions along the prevertebral and danger spaces of the neck from the C2–T4 levels with associated osteomyelitis of the vertebral bodies of C4 and C5. PET/CT suggested DNI (descending necrotizing infection) with DNM (descending necrotizing mediastinitis), combined with osteomyelitis of VBs of C4 and C5, and less likely, bone metastases in VBs of C4 and C5. Contrast-enhanced neck CT revealed localized abscesses with the fluid collection and rim enhancement in the retropharyngeal space and T1-T4 prevertebral space. Klebsiella pneumoniae was isolated in the blood and sputum cultures of the patient.
