A 66-year-old man with a history of smoking 20 cigarettes per day until the age of 50, abstained for the past 16 years, and cerebral infarction, for which he takes 25 mg of clopidogrel, underwent a routine medical checkup. Chest radiography during this checkup revealed a 3 cm mass in the left middle lung field. Further investigation included blood tests, which revealed no significant abnormalities. Carcinoembryonic antigen was measured at 2.1 ng/mL, squamous cell carcinoma antigen at 1.5 ng/mL, and cytokeratin 19 fragment at 0.9 ng/mL. The patient also has hypertension, managed with candesartan 4 mg. Contrast-enhanced CT imaging showed a ground-glass nodule with a maximum diameter of 4.6 cm and a solid component measuring 4 cm, located in S9/10 of the left lower lobe. Absence of emphysema was noted. Pulmonary function tests indicated normal respiratory capacity. A follow-up contrast-enhanced CT scan revealed no emphysematous changes or inflammation at the pneumatocele site. A part-solid nodule measuring 1.6 \u00d7 1.4 cm, with a 1.5 cm solid component, was detected in S9/10 of the left lower lobe. A part-solid nodule with a maximum diameter of 4.6 cm and a solid component measuring 4.1 cm was also observed. PET-CT showed mild accumulation in the mass in the left lower lobe, with an SUVmax of 2.04. No evidence of distant metastasis was found. Fluorodeoxyglucose accumulation was detected in the tumor in the left lower lobe, with an SUVmax of 2.04. Contrast-enhanced MRI of the head revealed no abnormalities suggestive of brain metastasis. Bronchoscopy with transbronchial lung biopsy and brushing/irrigation cytology showed no evidence of cancer. Based on these findings, the patient was suspected to have stage IB primary lung cancer. Surgical biopsy followed by lobectomy was planned.
