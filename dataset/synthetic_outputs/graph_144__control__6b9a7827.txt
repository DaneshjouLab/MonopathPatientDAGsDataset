A 47-year-old male patient with a past medical history remarkable for heavy smoking, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and previous intravenous drug use presented to the emergency department with persistent nonradiating pain in the right hypochondrium, nausea, anorexia, early satiety, and an 11-kg weight loss over 1 month. Physical examination revealed painful hepatomegaly. Laboratory values demonstrated a microcytic normochromic anemia (Hb 7.2 g/dL), and elevated cholestasis markers (alkaline phosphatase 254 U/L, gamma-glutamyl transferase 287 U/L). Abdominal ultrasound showed an enlarged and diffusely nodular liver. Thoraco-abdominopelvic CT demonstrated a 2-cm nodule in the inferior lobe of the left lung and signs of diffuse hepatic metastases. An upper endoscopy revealed a 1-cm ulcerated nodular lesion in the greater curvature of the gastric body. Biopsies demonstrated submucosal infiltration of small hyperchromatic cells with scant cytoplasm. Immunohistochemistry revealed diffuse immunoreactivity to CAM5.2, synaptophysin, and chromogranin, compatible with gastric infiltration of neoplastic cells with neuroendocrine differentiation. Liver biopsy showed similar histology. Bronchoalveolar lavage cytology and bronchial biopsy revealed TTF-1-positive cells with similar expression of neuroendocrine markers, confirming small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). A diagnosis of stage IV SCLC with gastric and hepatic metastases was established, and palliative chemotherapy was initiated. The patient's functional status rapidly deteriorated.
