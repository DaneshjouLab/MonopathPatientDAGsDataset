A 76-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with a cough that had persisted for several months. He had a history of smoking 20 cigarettes per day for over 30 years, but had quit 2 years prior to admission. He reported no family history of genetic disease or tumor. Routine blood, fecal, and urine tests were normal.

Comprehensive evaluations of cardiac, hepatic, renal, pulmonary, coagulation, and electrolyte functions showed no significant abnormalities. Tumor markers, including CEA, Cyfra21-1, and SCC, were within normal ranges. Physical examination indicated a Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) of 80%, with less than 5% weight loss over three months. A contrasted CT scan revealed a 5cm x 3cm mass in the lower lobe of the right lung with uneven enhancement.

Further imaging with PET/CT and cranial MRI showed no distant metastasis. No mediastinal lymph node enlargement was observed.

A biopsy was performed, which revealed Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (LUSC). The clinical staging was determined to be T2bN0M0 IIA.

The patient and his family refused surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment.

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis was performed to identify potential targetable mutations. NGS analysis revealed an FGFR3-IER5L fusion mutation (MAF 12.5%), NF1 shift mutation (MAF=13.4%), TP53 nonsense mutation (MAF=11.1%), CSF1R splicing mutation (MAF=13.7%) and ROS1 exon 34 missense mutation (MAF=15.4%). The tumor mutation burden (TMB) was 5.3 mut/Mb and microsatellite stability (MSS) was noted.

PD-L1 testing was performed, and the PD-L1 TPS was 3% detected by 22C3 antibody.

The patient declined treatment with FGFR inhibitors and was administered anlotinib 12 mg orally every morning (days 1-14, with a 21-day cycle).

After anlotinib treatment for 2 cycles, the patient achieved a partial response.
