A patient presented with treatment-na√Øve small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and symptomatic multiple brain metastases (BMs), including a cerebellar mass and posterior fossa BMs with satellite lesions. The patient was initially treated with chemoimmunotherapy consisting of carboplatin, etoposide, and atezolizumab. This resulted in a remarkable regression of the large cerebellar lesion and complete responses in smaller lesions. Consolidative thoracic radiotherapy was administered.

However, the patient subsequently experienced local progression of the thoracic lesions. The thoracic lesions had progressed. The patient was then treated with amrubicin.

Following this, four new BMs developed, including pons involvement. These four BMs were treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), resulting in complete responses (CRs). The patient also experienced sustained regression of the thoracic lesions.

Later, the patient developed meningeal dissemination and multiple new BMs with CSF dissemination. The patient then underwent concurrent chemo-WBRT (whole brain radiation therapy). The patient had durable tumor responses.

Ultimately, the patient's case highlights the challenges of managing aggressive neuroendocrine malignancy with brain metastasis, specifically SCLC BMs. The treatment course involved a combination of systemic therapy (chemoimmunotherapy, chemotherapy), stereotactic radiosurgery, and conventional WBRT, with considerations for focal dose escalation, dose de-escalation, and adverse effects. The patient's disease course evolved from initial response to chemoimmunotherapy to subsequent progression and dissemination, requiring multiple lines of treatment. The case also demonstrates the importance of stereotactic radiosurgery in managing brain metastases.
