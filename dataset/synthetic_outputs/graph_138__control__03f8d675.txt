A 47-year-old female patient was found to have an abnormality of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) at 14.18 ug/L in October 2020, without positive gastrointestinal endoscope findings. A chest plain computed tomography (CT) was conducted three months later, revealing a 26.7 mm plus 24.1 mm solid nodule in the right upper lobe, with a double-check high CEA (17.18ug/L). The patient had no smoking history and no family history of lung cancer. A CT examination on June 7th 2021, after anti-infective therapy, showed a 36.7 mm plus 34.1 mm mass with irregular shape, lobalation, spiculation, pleural indentation, and vessel convergence. Enhanced contrast CT elucidated that station 4R lymph node was slightly enlarged with 10 mm short axis. The CEA was 26.96 ug/L, squamous cell carcinoma antigen was 1.98 ng/mL, CYFRA 21âˆ’1 was 3.12 ng/mL, and pro-gastric releasing peptide was 65 ng/L. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) suggested that the 40 mm*39mm*34mm mass was highly suspected of lung cancer with standard uptake value (SUV) 14.6. The swollen mediastinal lymph node 3A and 4R had a high uptake (SUV max = 4.5). Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and bone scan had negative results. A CT guided pulmonary biopsy was performed and the pathology suggested poor cell differentiated lung adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrinization. The patient received right upper lobectomy with systemic lymph node dissection. Postoperative pathological analysis confirmed the diagnosis of combined LCNEC, ADC, and SCC. Grossly, the tumor was solid, gray-white, with a moderate hardness texture and vague boundaries. The size was 40 mm*35mm*25mm without visceral pleural invasion. The lymph nodes including station 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, and 11 were all negative. Histology showed that the tumor consisted of 40% acinar adenocarcinoma, 10% mucinous adenocarcinoma, 40% LCNEC, and 10% poor cell differentiated SCC. The postoperative histology and staging of the tumor suggested C-LCNEC with adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma and T2aN0M0 stage IB. Next-generation sequencing test showed *KIF5B/RET* fusion mutation without *EGFR*, *ALK*, *RB1*, and *TP53* alterations. Adjuvant chemotherapy with 4-cycle docetaxel plus carboplatin was given, and brain metastasis occurred after 10 months. The patient then received brain radiotherapy.
