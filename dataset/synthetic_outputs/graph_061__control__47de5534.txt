We report the case of a 65-year-old woman with stage IVB lung adenocarcinoma who developed malignant ascites during treatment. Despite multiple ascitic fluid drainages and second-line chemotherapy, the ascites progressively worsened. The initiation of cell-free and concentrated ascites reinfusion therapy (CART) led to improved abdominal distention, increased blood albumin levels, and slower ascites accumulation. Cell-free and concentrated ascites reinfusion therapy (CART) was initiated; it relieved symptoms, increased serum albumin levels, and reduced ascites accumulation, allowing prolonged chemotherapy. This is the first reported case of CART combined with chemotherapy for malignant ascites in lung cancer.
