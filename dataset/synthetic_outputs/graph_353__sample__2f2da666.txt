A 75-year-old female was admitted with recurrent fever, cough, and sputum production for over 8 months. She had a 30-pack-year smoking history, having quit 6 months prior. Her medical history was unremarkable, with no history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes, or other chronic illnesses. There was no abnormal personal, familial, or other psychosocial medical history.

One month prior to admission, the patient underwent a CT-guided percutaneous lung biopsy, which showed inflammation.

The patient received one week of anti-inflammatory treatment, but experienced no significant effects. Physical examination revealed no jaundice, bleeding, or rash on skin or mucous membranes. Superficial lymph nodes were not palpable or enlarged. Chest wall symmetry was maintained, with normal respiratory excursions and rhythmic breathing patterns. Auscultation revealed moist rales in the right upper lung field and slightly coarse breath sounds in the right lower and left lung fields, with no pleural friction rubs detected.

An enhanced chest CT scan showed a large consolidation shadow in the right upper lobe, with a central ring of low density. Sputum microbiological culture yielded negative results. Chest CT revealed a large area of consolidation in the upper lobe of the right lung accompanied by multiple enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. Postcontrast chest CT demonstrated moderate enhancement in the consolidated area of the upper lobe of the right lung, with quasi-round, slightly hypodense lesions within the focus; the boundaries were still clear. 3D reconstruction of the chest CT revealed bronchial narrowing and obstruction in the upper lobe of the right lung.

Laboratory results showed an AFP level of > 2,000 ng/ml. Reassessment revealed an AFP level of 15,290.36 ng/ml and a Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) level of 28.1 ng/ml. hCG and estradiol results were normal. Abdominal, pelvic, and cranial CT scans showed no significant abnormalities. The patient had a slightly elevated white blood cell count, normal procalcitonin levels, and a negative sputum microbiological culture.

A second lung biopsy was performed, obtaining five samples from different angles. Four samples appeared necrotic. Pathological examination of lesion specimens obtained via biopsy under CT guidance from central, anterior, posterior, left, and right angles. Samples 1 to 4 appeared as “fish-flesh-like” tissue, suggestive of necrosis. A greyish-white solid tissue sample was also obtained from the lesion.

Immunohistochemical analysis of the fifth biopsy sample revealed features consistent with hepatocellular adenoma (HAL). Immunohistochemical findings: TTF-1 negative, Napsin A negative, P40 negative, Syn negative, AFP positive, GPC-3 positive, Arg-1 positive, Hep-1 positive, CK positive, and CK7 negative. A final diagnosis of primary HAL (stage IIIC, T4N3M0) was made.
