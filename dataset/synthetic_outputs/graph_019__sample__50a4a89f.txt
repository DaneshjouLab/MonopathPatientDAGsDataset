In July 2023, a 54-year-old male presented with facial and dorsal hand edema and was diagnosed with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) with hilar, mediastinal lymph node, and pleural metastases (cT1N3M1a, extensive stage) and a PS score of 1. The patient started chemotherapy with four cycles of intravenous etoposide 160 mg (days 1–3), carboplatin (400 mg) on day 1, and serplulimab 300 mg on day 1 (Q3W). He then received serplulimab maintenance therapy (Q3W). After 18 cycles of chemotherapy and serplulimab maintenance, follow-up evaluations showed partial response (PR). After two cycles of serplulimab treatment, the patient intermittently (every 2–3 months) experienced hard stools and occasional constipation, relieved with glycerin suppositories. On September 9, 2024, the patient was admitted to the gastroenterology department due to 5 days of no bowel movement. An abdominal CT revealed diffuse dilatation and gas accumulation in the bowel, particularly the colon, suggesting incomplete intestinal obstruction. Gastroscopy showed chronic atrophic gastritis (C2) with bile reflux. Colonoscopy revealed a subpedunculated polyp approximately 1.5 cm in size, 20 cm from the anus, with smooth mucosa in the sigmoid colon. Colonoscopy reached the descending colon at 40 cm, where the mucosa and colonic haustra were smooth; however, due to severe pain and copious dry feces, the procedure was terminated. The patient experienced an inability to defecate and lost 20 kg in weight over 2 months.
