An elderly male in his 80s with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and a 90 pack-year smoking history, presented to a local hospital with a week-long history of shortness of breath. A chest X-ray revealed a large mass in the right lower lung field, which was not present one year prior. A non-contrast chest CT scan confirmed a 60x50x80 mm mass with heterogeneous internal density in the right lower lobe, along with moderate pleural effusion. Initial blood work showed an elevated WBC count of 9130/\u00b5L and a CRP concentration of 2.5 mg/dL.

The patient was admitted to the hospital and underwent intercostal tube drainage. Cytological analysis of the pleural effusion, which was yellow and cloudy, was classified as class \u2161, leading to a diagnosis of pulmonary suppuration with empyema. Antibiotic treatment was initiated.

After two weeks of antibiotic treatment, the patient's inflammatory reaction worsened, with the WBC count increasing to 11160/\u00b5L and the CRP concentration rising to 13.0 mg/dL. Follow-up CT images showed an increase in the size of the mass.

After three weeks of antibiotic treatment with no improvement, the patient was referred to our department for surgical intervention. Blood examination at this time revealed a high inflammatory reaction, with a WBC count of 18500/\u00b5L and a CRP concentration of 25.41 mg/dL. Tumor markers (carcinoembryonic antigen, cytokeratin 19 fragment, and pro-gastrin-releasing peptide) and markers of infectious disease (tuberculosis, aspergillus, and fungus) were not elevated.

A subsequent chest CT showed the right lower lobe lesion had increased in size, now measuring 110x110x150 mm, with fluids within the mass. The working diagnosis was pulmonary suppuration or lung cancer with infection, and surgical intervention was planned to control the infection.
