In June 2020, a Caucasian male patient in his fifth decade of life, a non-smoking bank clerk, was admitted to the hospital. A routine CT scan revealed a spiculated nodule in the left basal pyramid associated with pleural retraction. The patient had a past medical history of myelodysplastic syndrome, followed in the Hematology outpatient clinic but not requiring medical treatment. A cranioencephalic MRI did not show distant metastasis.

A subsequent PET CT scan showed a left inferior lobe lesion (LIL) with SUV 5, clinical stage cT1bcN0cM0. Cytology of bronchoalveolar lavage from the left inferior lobe lesion (LIL) was positive for poorly differentiated carcinoma, suggestive of adenocarcinoma.

In December 2020, the patient underwent Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic lobectomy with lymphadenectomy. The histological diagnosis of the surgical specimen was pT1c pN2, G2, R0, Stage III A (AJCC 8Th Edition).

In January 2021, adjuvant chemotherapy with Cisplatin-Etoposide was proposed, but only two cycles were completed.

The patient subsequently presented with de novo dorsal pain. A dorsal CT revealed two de novo osteolytic lesions on D1 and D7. An MRI of the cervical-back-sacral spine showed 4 de novo lesions.

In May 2021, computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical-dorsal-sacral spine revealed 4 metastatic bone lesions, including a de novo metastatic lesion in L2. A guided biopsy was performed for histological confirmation of bone metastasis.

Histology of the left iliac wing bone showed fragments of an adenocarcinoma (CK7+, Napsin-A+, TTF1+ (focal)), compatible with lung adenocarcinoma metastasis.

In May 2021, irradiation of lesions with a greater probability of complications in the short/medium term—D7, L2, left iliac—was performed with a single fraction of 8 Gy.

Also in May 2021, Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) showed breaking of the ALK gene (2p12).

In June 2021, the patient started on the ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) Alectinib 600 mg twice a day (bid).
