We report a case of a 50-year-old male patient with malignant pleural effusion and resistance to third-generation TKIs. On June 13, 2024, a PET-CT scan indicated disease progression, including thickening of nodular lesions in the pleura and malignant pleural effusion, suggesting resistance to third-generation TKIs. Rebiopsy of the pleura indicated adenocarcinoma infiltration in the connective tissue. Subsequent NGS confirmed the *EGFR* p.L858R mutation, *EGFR* amplification, and *TP53* p.V157F mutation of the tumor. Hyperthermic intrathoracic chemotherapy (HITHOC) was administered. HITHOC significantly reduced the tumor burden of the patient and helped restore sensitivity to third-generation TKIs. HITHOC resulted in a significant decrease of tumor burden.
