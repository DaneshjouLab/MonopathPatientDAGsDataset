An 84-year-old never-smoking woman with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, arthritis, and hypertension presented with an incidental, well-circumscribed, enlarging nodule (1.4 × 1.3 × 0.9 cm) in the left upper lobe (LUL). The nodule had been followed by her primary care provider, measuring 0.9 × 0.8 cm four years prior. Recent chest CT scan revealed the lesion to be 1.3 x. Initial imaging found it to be highly suspicious of lung cancer. The patient denied shortness of breath, cough, chest pain, hemoptysis, palpitation, fever, and recent illness. Upon surgical resection, pathological analysis confirmed the tumor’s characteristics to be consistent with a benign PPM. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, and there is no evidence of recurrence.
