The patient, with a smoking history, was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma, which had metastasized to the bone, resulting in a T4N2M1 stage IV diagnosis. The patient presented with symptoms of coughing, shortness of breath, chest pain, back pain, and hemoptysis. Imaging revealed local atelectasis, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and a 4x4 cm right lower hilar lymph node enlargement. A biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma.

Following treatment, the patient's coughing and shortness of breath were significantly relieved, and local atelectasis and pericardial effusion were alleviated. However, the patient later developed coughing, shortness of breath, and lower back pain. Imaging revealed elevated local atelectasis, a large amount of pericardial effusion, and bilateral pleural effusion.

Subsequent imaging displayed a relieved atelectasis and diminished hilar lymph node tumor. However, the inflammation in the right lower lung was aggravated. Bilateral pleural effusion and pericardial effusion were nearly absorbed. Later, the patient's symptoms of coughing and shortness of breath worsened, and discomfort in the upper right abdomen developed. Atelectasis at the right middle lobe was noted, along with an enlarged right lower hilar lymph node.
