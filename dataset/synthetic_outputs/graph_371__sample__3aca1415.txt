In August 2021, a 68-year-old male presented with epigastric pain. An abdominal CT scan revealed a space-occupying lesion in the body of the pancreas. Enhanced CT scans of the chest and pelvis showed no abnormalities. Preoperative carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA199) levels were significantly elevated at 798.7 U/ml (normal range, 0-27 U/ml).

The patient underwent laparoscopic radical pancreatic body-tail resection and splenectomy. Postoperative pathology confirmed moderately differentiated ductal adenocarcinoma (pT3N0M0). R0 resection was achieved.

The patient declined chemotherapy and other treatments and asked for routine follow-up to monitor the lesion.

Subsequently, the patient progressed with the development of a posterior cardiac annular nodule (1.7x1.3 cm). CA199 was 35.73 U/ml.

Upper abdominal CT showed growth of the posterior cardiac annular nodule to 2.3x2.8 cm. CA199 level spiked to 124.8 U/ml. The patient was diagnosed with recurrent metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score of 1.

The patient underwent four cycles of combination therapy, resulting in the disappearance of the posterior cardia lesion.

After 20 cycles of combination therapy, no tumor relapse was observed.

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) identified a BRCA2 mutation, microsatellite stability (MSS), a tumor mutational burden (TMB) of 5.76 Muts/Mb and PD-L1 negativity. The patient was initiated on a treatment regimen comprising of anlotinib (10 mg, days 1-14; 7 days off; 21-day cycle) and tislelizumab (200 mg, day 1; 20 days off; 21-day cycle).

Following four cycles of combination therapy, the patient achieved a complete response (CR), with total tumor disappearance.

The patient continued treatment regimen without adverse effects and remains on the regimen. Abdominal CT scans indicate complete response (CR) with a progression-free survival (PFS) duration of 14 months.
