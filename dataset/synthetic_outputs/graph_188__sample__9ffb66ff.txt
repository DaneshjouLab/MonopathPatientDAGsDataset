In December 2019, the patient was diagnosed with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC) with metastases to the thoracic and abdominal lymph nodes.

In May 2020, systemic chemotherapy (carboplatin/etoposide/atezolizumab) was delayed due to a port infection. The patient then received four treatment cycles of carboplatin/etoposide/atezolizumab and was placed on maintenance atezolizumab.

In August 2020, the patient was diagnosed with metastatic brain lesions and received stereotactic radiation surgery.

In early April 2022, the patient presented with a 4-week history of a gradually worsening visual field defect.

In May 2022, a brain MRI confirmed three stable brain lesions.

The patient was diagnosed with CMV retinitis based on fundoscopic examination and started on oral ganciclovir.

On May 11, 2022, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of the left eye was 20/20, and anterior and posterior segment examinations were normal. Best-corrected visual acuity of her right eye was 20/30. Confrontational visual fields showed superior and nasal visual field defects. Right eye examination revealed: Intraocular pressure of 31 mmHg. Funduscopic examination showed a yellow-white retinal lesion with associated retinal hemorrhages extending from the inferior disk and macula to the inferior and inferotemporal periphery. Optical coherence tomography showed outer retinal fluid extending from the optic disk toward the fovea with mild subfoveal fluid. Anterior segment examination was unremarkable without cell or flare. Right eye examination revealed: Small preretinal hemorrhage along the nasal disk. Optical coherence tomography shows nasal outer retinal fluid with subretinal fluid beneath the fovea. Serum testing for CMV was positive for IgG and negative for IgM. Additional tests for infectious retinitis, including syphilis, tuberculosis, and toxoplasmosis, were negative. An anterior chamber tap was performed and sent for CMV, varicella-zoster viruses, and herpes simplex viruses Type 1 and Type 2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses.

Ganciclovir was injected intravitreally, oral valganciclovir was discontinued, and IV ganciclovir treatment was initiated. One week later, PCR tests returned negative, and the funduscopic appearance was unchanged.
