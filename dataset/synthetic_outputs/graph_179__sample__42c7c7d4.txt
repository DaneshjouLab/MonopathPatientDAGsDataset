A 78-year-old former smoker with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) type emphysema (FEV1/FVC: 46%, FEV1: 70% and DLCO: 49%), managed with bronchodilators and regular pulmonologist follow-up, was admitted to a non-tertiary care hospital due to dyspnea, cough, myalgia, and fever. The patient presented with acute respiratory failure with hypoxemia and hypocapnia. A PCR test of a nasopharyngeal swab confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Chest radiography revealed right basal opacities and a diffuse interstitial bilateral pattern. The patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia and treated with hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, interferon beta, and corticoids, along with non-invasive ventilation. After 10 days of hospitalization, the patient was discharged with home oxygen and instructed to maintain solitary confinement for 14 days. On the fourth day of individual isolation, the patient developed acute dyspnea and chest pain and was readmitted to the hospital. A subsequent chest radiograph showed a left complete pneumothorax. A 20F chest tube was inserted, revealing a continuous 3/5 air leak. The patient was kept in isolation in a COVID-19 restricted area.
