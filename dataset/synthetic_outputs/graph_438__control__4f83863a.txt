A 53-year-old HIV-positive man with a controlled viral load presented with a large left hilar mass and a left upper lobe nodule, both showing significant uptake on positron emission tomography scans. The patient underwent bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage, endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) using an Olympus™ Vizishot 2 needle, and EBUS-guided transbronchial forceps biopsies (TBFB) of a left hilar lymph node using a 1.8 mm Boston Scientific™ forceps. The EBUS-TBNA revealed granulomas. Subsequent EBUS-guided TBFB revealed nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin's lymphoma of intrathoracic lymph nodes, indicating HIV-associated Hodgkin's lymphoma.
