We present a 57-year-old male patient with squamous cell lung cancer, who presented to the Emergency Department with acute onset of hemoptysis and severe respiratory distress. The patient had a notable medical history of recent stage III squamous cell lung cancer affecting the left mainstem bronchus.

Upon initial evaluation, the patient exhibited signs of respiratory distress, with tachypnea (40 breaths per minute), sinus tachycardia at 144 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation as low as 79 % despite 100 % Fi02 via a non-rebreather mask. Laboratory investigation indicated a baseline hemoglobin level of 10.9 g/dl, a normal platelet count and an INR of 1. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed respiratory acidosis, with a pH of 7.27, a pCO2 of 54, a pO2 of 94, and a bicarbonate level of 25.

Given ongoing hypoxemic hypoxic respiratory failure, the patient was intubated with a standard 8.0 endotracheal tube and oxygen saturations improved to 97 % on 100 % FiO2 that was quickly decreased to 30 %. Frank blood was visible from the endotracheal tube and an emergent bronchoscopy was performed to visualize the site of bleeding. Bronchoscopy did not reveal ongoing bleeding. Imaging showed a left lower lobe tumor, a cavitary lesion communicating with the bronchus, and a pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysm. Successful embolization of the originating segmental branch of the pulmonary artery was performed.
