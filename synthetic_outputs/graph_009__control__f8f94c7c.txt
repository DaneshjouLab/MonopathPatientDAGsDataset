A patient presented with exertional breathlessness, chronic fatigue, and bilateral chest wall discomfort. Initial investigations revealed a pulmonary abnormality, ultimately diagnosed as adenocarcinoma of the lung, which later metastasized. The patient underwent radiotherapy as part of their treatment regimen.

Following treatment, the patient experienced several complications, including pleural effusion, lung torsion (specifically lower lobe torsion), hemorrhagic infarction, and gangrene. The patient also experienced dyspnea, fever, and chest pain, potentially related to bronchial stenosis. Trauma and post-surgery complications further complicated the case. Ischemia-reperfusion injury was also noted. Despite treatment efforts, the patient ultimately succumbed to their illness. The repeated incidence of lung torsion and the need for multiple radiotherapy sessions suggest a challenging and complex clinical course. The patient's death was likely a consequence of the advanced stage of lung cancer and the subsequent complications.
