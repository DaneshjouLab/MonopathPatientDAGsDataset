A rare case of combined small cell lung cancer (CSCLC) with adenocarcinoma was reported in an elderly patient. CSCLC is defined as cancer tissues mainly containing small cell lung cancer (SCLC) components with non-SCLC (NSCLC) histopathological types. While the most common NSCLC components are squamous cell carcinoma or large cell carcinoma, CSCLC containing adenocarcinoma is extremely rare.

The patient was surgically treated and diagnosed with CSCLC with adenocarcinoma. The patient remained well for over 2 weeks after the treatment.

During the procedure, after the lesion was cut off, biopsy forceps were used to remove tissue from the mass for rapid freezing pathology. The pathological diagnosis confirmed small cell lung cancer combined with adenocarcinoma.

A review of the literature revealed only 15 reported cases of pulmonary SCLC combined with adenocarcinoma, including the present case. The ratio of male to female patients was 4:1, and the mean age was 68 years.

Histopathologically, the tumor lesion was composed of two distinct parts, clearly defined under the microscope. The SCLC component consisted of small, uniform, poorly differentiated necrotic cancers. The other half was adenocarcinoma with papillary and acinar features.

Genetic analysis, including loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis, has been performed in some cases of CSCLC. Studies suggest that the small cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma components in CSCLC are clone-related, but the adenocarcinoma component may come from a single clone and has no obvious correlation with small cell carcinoma.
