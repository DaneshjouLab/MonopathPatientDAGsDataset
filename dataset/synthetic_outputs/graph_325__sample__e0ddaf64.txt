A 62-year-old male presented with recurrent hemoptysis and cough. Chest tomography revealed left lower lobe atelectasis, raising suspicion for lung cancer. Physical examination was normal. Thorax computed tomography (CT) revealed that the bronchus of left lower lobe was narrowed with associated local atelectasis, emphysema, pulmonary bullae, and thickened pleura. Bronchoscopy showed a slit-like stenosis at the dorsal bronchial segment of the left lower lobe, swollen and smooth mucosa, and a significantly wider subsection carina. Bronchoscopy showed no abnormal vessels or active bleeding and the other bronchus was normal. Following biopsy attempt at the carina of dorsal bronchial segment, the entire left airway immediately filled with blood. Rescue and resuscitation measures were initiated, including ipsilateral positioning, increased oxygen flow, thrombin airway instillation, intravenous vasopressin, and sustained aspiration. The patient developed hemorrhagic shock and anti-shock measures were implemented, including intravenous polygeline, compound sodium chloride solution, dopamine, and type-A erythrocyte suspension. Estimated blood loss of 1500 ml. Bleeding stopped 20 minutes later. The patient was referred to the intensive care unit for further observation. Dieulafoy's disease of bronchus was suspected and bronchial arteriography was recommended. The patient developed a recurrent massive hemoptysis 3 hours later. Double-lumen endotracheal intubation was performed immediately and single-lung ventilation was started to maintain oxygenation. Bronchial arteriography showed abundant distorted and hyperplastic bronchial arteries in the left lower lobe, accompanied with contrast agent overflow from the vascular lesion. An aneurysmal vessel embolized with poly-vinyl alcohol (PVA) particles of 500 Î¼m diameter. Hemoptysis stopped completely. However, during the initial bronchoscopy-guided biopsy, massive hemorrhage occurred immediately. The patient died despite immediate rescue measures and bronchial artery embolization.
