A 68-year-old female patient with a BMI of 26 and a height of 165 cm (weight 70.3 kg) presented with pulmonary masses abutting the pleura or enlarged head/neck lymph nodes. The patient underwent transthoracic biopsies. Biopsies were performed under local anesthetic using a SonoSiteÂ® ultrasound with linear and curvilinear probes. An eight-centimeter 22 gauge fine needle aspiration (FNA) or an eight-centimeter 18 gauge Temno core biopsy were used for sample collection, with a mean of 5 passes on all the biopsy sites. The mean size of the transthoracic target was 5.6 cm in the smaller dimension.

The patient experienced pneumothoracies, which resolved with chest tube placement for three days in the hospital. The patient also experienced one episode of hemoptysis which resolved within several hours without intervention and observation alone, and one vasovagal episode which was fully resolved with post procedural monitoring.

Onsite pathology determined sample adequacy and transferred biopsies to the department of pathology. Post procedure, patients were evaluated by either three-point ultrasound to establish lung sliding or chest radiograph. Biopsy pathology resulted in a range of potential diagnoses, including Infection Likely, Hepatocellular carcinoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, Malignant melanoma, Adenocarcinoma, t-cell lymphoma, Non-diagnostic, Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), NSCLC: Adenocarcinoma, NSCLC: Squamous, and Small Cell Lung Cancer.

72% of procedures had a diagnosis via fine needle aspiration alone. 30% of procedures were ultrasound guided head/neck lymph node biopsies. Eight non-diagnostic percutaneous biopsies were performed. Future pathological samples revealed four were non-small cell lung cancer, one was a T cell lymphoma and two resolved with antibiotics and time. One sample remained undiagnosed.
