A 66-year-old Caucasian female with a 40-pack-year history of smoking and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease presented for follow-up of synchronous multiple primary lung cancers: Stage IB left upper lobe adenocarcinoma and Stage IA right middle lobe (RML) squamous cell carcinoma. The patient was treated with left upper lobectomy and RML pulmonary wedge resection 5 years prior. Surveillance chest computed tomography showed an increase in the size of the subcarinal lymph node and right lymph node conglomerate encasing the right upper lobe pulmonary artery, consistent with metastasis. Fine-needle aspiration of level 4R lymph nodes was performed. Histology and immunohistochemical staining confirmed the diagnosis of small cell carcinoma. Consequently, the patient was placed on cisplatin/etoposide combination chemotherapy.
