A woman with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma, who had progressed on third-line therapy, developed severe neurological symptoms, including hypoacusis, headache, and dizziness, attributed to cerebral and bilateral internal auditory canal metastasis. The patient had previously failed platinum-based chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Next-generation sequencing identified a RET fusion mutation, leading to the initiation of selpercatinib as a fourth-line treatment. The patient exhibited significant clinical improvement within one week of therapy, including complete hearing recovery. Adverse effects were limited to elevated hepatic transaminases and QT interval prolongation, both of which were effectively managed through dose adjustments. The response to selpercatinib was sustained for over 31 months, at which point new brain metastasis developed, which was possible to address with whole-brain radiotherapy while maintaining targeted therapy with selpercatinib. The prolonged progression-free survival and favorable tolerability of selpercatinib, after dose modifications, underscore its potential as an effective treatment option for patients with central nervous system metastasis.
