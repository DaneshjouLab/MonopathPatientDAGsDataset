A 57-year-old man was diagnosed with T4N3M1c Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). He initially received one cycle of cisplatin plus gemcitabine, but experienced progressive disease (PD). Subsequently, he received two cycles of carboplatin plus paclitaxel, which also resulted in progressive disease (PD). Nivolumab was then initiated as third-line therapy. While on nivolumab, the patient developed liver metastases and metastases in the left femur. After 35 cycles of nivolumab, the patient developed bone metastasis in the left femur and received radiation therapy. Following 49 additional cycles of nivolumab (84 total cycles), the patient developed a metastatic lesion in the small intestine. The patient underwent surgical resection of the small intestine. Treatment with nivolumab was then reinitiated. Eighteen months after surgery, whole-body computed tomography (CT) showed no recurrence of lung cancer.
