A 39-year-old patient with a known family history of malignant mesothelioma presented with progressive shortness of breath and recurrent pleural effusions. The patient was diagnosed with familial malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), a rare and aggressive neoplasm. Diagnosis was confirmed through biopsies taken during uniportal Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery. The patient was found to have a confirmed BAP1 mutation. An 18F-FDG PET/CT scan yielded inconclusive results. Subsequently, subxiphoid uniportal Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery left pleural and laparoscopic peritoneal biopsies were obtained for staging and evaluating the contralateral lung and peritoneal cavity. The case highlights the importance of considering genetic predisposition and BAP1 tumor suppressor gene mutation, which might affect the age of presentation and overall prognosis of the disease. It also suggests that 18F-FDG PET/CT scan may not be the best modality for staging and confirming the diagnosis of malignant pleural mesothelioma.
