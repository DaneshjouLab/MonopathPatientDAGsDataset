A 67-year-old man with a history of significant occupational asbestos exposure presented to the Emergency Department in June 2024 with concerns of weight loss and abdominal distention for 4 weeks. He denied any alterations in bowel habits, melena, hematochezia, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, dysphagia, and odynophagia. He reported an 8.2 kg weight loss over the 4 weeks prior to presentation. The patient denied any prior history of tuberculosis or contact with anyone known to have tuberculosis. He was born in the United States and had been exposed to asbestos while working for a shipbuilding company. He denied any history of cigarette smoking or exposure to organic dusts. He had a pet dog but denied any history of exposure to pet birds or other exotic pets. He was not taking any regular medications and had not seen a physician for about 2 years prior to presentation. He had no reported history of any drug allergies. His family history was notable for coronary artery disease, but no known history of cancers in parents or siblings.

Initial presentation revealed vital signs within normal limits. Physical examination revealed bitemporal wasting, conjunctival pallor, and shifting dullness, suggestive of ascites. Laboratory investigations revealed normochromic normocytic anemia (hemoglobin 11.8 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume 85 fL) and hypoalbuminemia (serum albumin 2.1 g/dL). Liver function tests, serum creatinine, and electrolyte levels were within the reference range.

A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis (with contrast) showed massive ascites, smooth contour of liver, and a large nodule in the left lower lobe of lung, along with central calcification.

Abdominal paracentesis was performed with ultrasound guidance, draining 14.7 L of hazy yellow ascitic fluid. The patient was admitted to the medicine service. Abdominal ultrasonography with Doppler studies were ordered.

Ascitic fluid analysis revealed an exudative process with a Serum albumin-ascites gradient (SAAG) of 0.8 g/dL. Urine protein-to-creatinine ratio showed trace proteinuria (equivalent to <300 mg/day). Transthoracic echocardiography showed normal right ventricular function and left ventricular ejection fraction. Liver ultrasonography showed smooth liver margins and normal echotexture.

The first abdominal paracentesis yielded hazy yellow ascitic fluid with Nucleated cells 589 cells/\u00b5L (Lymphocytes 87%), Erythrocytes 1461 cells/\u00b5L, Lactate dehydrogenase 763 IU/L, Total protein 4.0 g/dL, Albumin 1.7 g/dL, Glucose 15 mg/dL, Serum albumin-ascites gradient (SAAG) 0.4 g/dL. Cytology showed no malignant cells identified. Gram-stain was Negative, and Bacterial culture was Negative.

Repeat ascitic fluid analysis showed AFB smear Negative, AFB culture No growth, and Fungal culture No growth. Abdominal ultrasonography showed the portal vein size and Doppler indices were within normal limits. The spleen was not enlarged.

Serum FibroTest-ActiTest was suggestive of no hepatic fibrosis (F0-).

The patient underwent multiple abdominal paracenteses as well as upper and lower endoscopies before diagnosis was established by an omental biopsy, after a delay of approximately 10 weeks.
