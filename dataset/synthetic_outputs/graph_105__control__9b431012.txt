A 38-year-old male smoker presented with stage 4 (cT1bN3M1b) NSCLC adenocarcinoma. The patient harbored an *EGFR* exon 19 deletion. Afatinib was administered as a first-line treatment, resulting in a partial response with 7.1 months of progression-free survival. After first-line EGFR TKI failure, a second biopsy revealed an acquired *EGFR* T790M mutation. Subsequently, the patient received lazertinib as part of a clinical trial (NCT03046992). After 6.2 months of partial response to lazertinib, the patient developed malignant ascites, suggesting peritoneal seeding due to resistance. The case report aimed to elucidate the underlying genomic alteration associated with resistance to lazertinib through deep-targeted sequencing of resistant tumor samples and the establishment of patient-derived cell lines (PDC).
