A 58-year-old man with a history of follicular B-cell lymphoma presented with shortness of breath on exertion, profuse sweating, unintentional weight loss, and abdominal pain. His family history was positive for hypertension in his mother. He never smoked or used illicit drugs, and drank occasionally in social situations. He lived near a paper mill for 10 years prior to diagnosis.

An abdominal radiograph documented a left lower quadrant mass. A CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed right hilar, mediastinal, abdominal, and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, bilateral pleural effusions, a liver mass, and a large soft-tissue mass (17x5.1 cm) infiltrating the small bowel mesentery. CT scan of the chest showed the size of the heart is within normal limits.

Biopsy of the abdominal mass was positive for IGH-BCL2 translocation, but showed no evidence of MYC or BCL6 gene rearrangement. Flow cytometry revealed <1% clonal B cells with a CD20-, CD10- and Kappa-positive phenotype.

Moderately small bilateral pleural effusions (larger on the left) were noted. A right hilar lymph node measured 2.2\u00d71.9 cm. Analysis of pleural fluid obtained by thoracentesis was positive for high-grade B-cell lymphoma of follicle center origin. The patient was referred to an oncologist for management.

A baseline echocardiogram showed normal left and right ventricular volumes, preserved left and right ventricular function (LVEF approximately 60%), no valvular issues, and mild pericardial effusion.

The patient subsequently developed oliguria and acute respiratory distress secondary to tumor lysis syndrome and was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit. He underwent therapeutic thoracentesis and renal replacement therapy.

The patient was started on chemotherapy with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone (R-CHOP) during a 12-day hospitalization.

After completing the eighth R-CHOP cycle, his clinical condition progressively worsened, developing severe shortness of breath, cough, inability to lie flat, leg heaviness, and ankle swelling.

He was readmitted to the hospital for acute systolic heart failure and atrial fibrillation (AFib) with rapid ventricular response. Cardioversion under deep sedation was required to reestablish a normal sinus rhythm.

A repeat echocardiogram showed severe reduction in left ventricular systolic function with LVEF of 15%, severe generalized hypokinesis, right ventricular dysfunction, dilation of both the left and right atria, moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, and mild to moderate pulmonary hypertension. He was started on heart failure management and anticoagulation. Left heart catheterization showed normal coronary arteries. He was discharged home with a wearable defibrillator (LifeVest), to reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death.

Microscopic examination of the pleural fluid revealed threadlike filaments (filopodia-like filaments, caliber \u22640.1\u00b5m) trapping clusters of mesothelial cells and atypical lymphocytes. Single tubular filaments arose from the atypical lymphocytes reaching the neighboring cells, whose cytosols (and/or nuclei) contained small, dark inclusions. Long
