A patient with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the esophagus underwent neo-adjuvant concurrent chemoradiation therapy followed by esophagectomy with gastric pull-up reconstruction.

Later, the patient developed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Given the history of SCC, adenocarcinoma was also considered in the differential diagnosis. The patient underwent stereotactic radiotherapy.

Following this, the patient received Pembrolizumab, an immunotherapy drug. A salvage lobectomy, performed via robotic-assisted thoracic surgery (RATS), was undertaken. In some cases, a thoracotomy might be necessary. Minimally invasive thoracic surgery was considered.

Another patient with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the esophagus underwent neo-adjuvant concurrent chemoradiation therapy with Carboplatin and Paclitaxel, followed by esophagectomy with gastric pull-up reconstruction.

Later, the patient developed adenocarcinoma. The patient underwent stereotactic radiotherapy.

Following this, the patient received Pembrolizumab. A salvage lobectomy was performed. Mediastinal lymph node dissection was also performed. Ropivacaine was used for intercostal nerve block.

A patient with adenocarcinoma underwent thoracic surgery, including lung resection. This patient may have presented with early-stage NSCLC, locally advanced stages, or metastatic lymph node involvement. Extended resections may have been required.
