Herein, we report a patient with metastatic NSCLC who benefited from almonertinib after developing resistance to osimertinib. EGFR is an important oncogene in NSCLC, and EGFR TKIs like osimertinib are standard care for NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations. However, acquired resistance almost inevitably develops. Osimertinib also shows good activity for NSCLC patients with EGFR T790M mutants. Unfortunately, these patients eventually develop acquired resistance to osimertinib. Overcoming drug resistance is a clinical problem that needs to be solved urgently. Almonertinib was approved in China in March 2020 for the treatment of advanced EGFR T790M-positive NSCLC.
