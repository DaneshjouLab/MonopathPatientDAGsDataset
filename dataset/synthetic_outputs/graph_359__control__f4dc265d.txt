Lung cancer is a leading cause of mortality worldwide, and low-dose computed tomography (CT) is crucial for screening and monitoring recurrence. Solitary thin-walled lung adenocarcinoma is a rare and challenging form of lung cancer, often misdiagnosed as benign lesions. This case report describes a unique instance of lung adenocarcinoma with gradual enlargement of a thin-walled cavity surrounded by pure ground glass opacity (GGO) on CT for over 10 years.

The patient had a history of lung cancer surgery in 2007 (adenocarcinoma in the right upper lobe, at T2bN0M0 stage 2A). The patient was otherwise in good health with no comorbidities.

Previously reported cases of lung cancer presenting as thin-walled cysts had a maximum observation time of 6 months. Lung adenocarcinoma with gradual enlargement of a thin-walled cavity surrounded by pure GGO for more than 10 years has never been reported before. This case report describes the natural course of lung adenocarcinoma with a thin-walled cavity, which confirms the check-valve mechanism.
