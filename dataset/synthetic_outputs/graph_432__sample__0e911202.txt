The patient presented with normal respiratory sounds in both lungs and a family history of cancer, including a father who died of liver cancer and a mother who suffered from bile duct cancer.

On April 9, 2019, a contrast-enhanced CT of the chest revealed a mass in the lower lobe of the left lung and the right lower lung, suggesting lung cancer. A lymph node biopsy confirmed small cell lung cancer (SCLC). A subsequent PET/CT scan on April 15, 2019, showed positive lesions in the right lower lobe, mediastinal soft tissue, left lower lobe, bilateral hilum, and other sites.

The patient was started on an EP chemotherapy regimen consisting of etoposide 100 mg/m2 on days 1-3 and cisplatin 25 mg/m2 on days 1-3 in each 3-week period. After two cycles of chemotherapy, the efficacy was evaluated as a partial response (PR).

A chest CT on May 24, 2019, showed no significant change in the left mass. A puncture biopsy of the left lung mass on May 27, 2019, revealed low differentiated carcinoma, consistent with adenocarcinoma, with the possibility of complex carcinoma. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) indicated fusion of EML4 and ALK.

The final diagnosis was terminal SCLC in the lower lobe of the right lung (cT2aN3M0, IIIB) and ALK mutation adenocarcinoma of the lower lobe of the left lung (cT4N2M0 IIIB, ALK mutation).
