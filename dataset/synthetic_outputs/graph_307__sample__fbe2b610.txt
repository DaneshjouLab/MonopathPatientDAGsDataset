A 69-year-old male was admitted to the hospital complaining of chest distress and shortness of breath for one year, with worsening symptoms in the preceding 15 days. His physical examination upon admission was unremarkable. He had a significant smoking history of over 50 years but no history of peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, coronary heart disease, diabetes, hepatitis, typhoid fever, tuberculosis, trauma, or familial hereditary diseases.

Contrast-enhanced CT of the chest revealed a 20 x 15 x 16 mm nodule in the right lower lobe (S8) with a clear boundary, lobulated margin, slight enhancement, and multiple hive-like low-density areas in the center. Chest imaging also showed a 20 x 14 x 13 mm nodule with an irregular margin, uneven thickness of the cavity wall, and a local nodular solid density shadow in the right upper lobe (S1). Ultrasonography of the liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, and kidney showed no abnormalities. Tumor marker analysis revealed a carcino-embryonic antigen level of 5.16 ng/mL, a cytokeratin-19-fragment level of 3.54 ng/mL, and a neuron-specific enolase level of 13.00 ng/mL.

The patient underwent wedge resection of the upper and lower lobes in the right lung via video-assisted thoracoscopy. Frozen pathology of the right lower lobe wedge tissue revealed a 2.0 cm nodule with a solid section, greyish-white color, local colloidal substance, and a clear boundary with surrounding tissue. Another nodule with a maximum diameter of 1.8 cm was found in the wedge tissue of the right upper lobe, showing a solid section, greyish-white color, and an unclear boundary with surrounding tissue. Subsequently, the patient underwent right upper lobectomy and lymph node dissection under video-assisted thoracoscopy. Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) staining of the S8 nodule showed tumor tissues with rupture of alveolar septum.
