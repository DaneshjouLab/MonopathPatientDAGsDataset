A patient was admitted on May 29, 2024, presenting with symmetrical erythematous papules and plaques throughout the body, dry and scaly skin, severe pruritus, and visible scratch marks. A dermatopathologic biopsy of leg skin revealed epidermal hyperkeratosis, hyperkeratosis, superficial crusting, hypertrophy of the stratum spinosum, and mass infiltration of lymphocytes, histiocytes, and plasma cells around superficial dermal vessels. PAS stain was negative. Lab results showed mild eosinophilia [0.57 * 109/L (normal, 0.02-0.52)], 1.2% basophils (normal, 0-1), and 117.20 KIU/L serum IgE (normal, 0-100).

Treatment was initiated with a compound betamethasone intramuscular injection (1 mL of 5 mg betamethasone dipropionate with 2 mg betamethasone sodium phosphate, both measured as betamethasone), topical application of a 1:1 mixture of triamceinolone acetonide acetate cream (1.5%) and allantoin cream twice daily. Additionally, chlorphenamine maleate tablets 5 mg were prescribed orally every night for intense itching.

Genetic testing revealed a KIF5B-exon24-RET-exon11 fusion variant (15.18% variant rate). Consequently, the patient was diagnosed with a secondary malignant tumor of the frontal lobe and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The patient developed a secondary malignancy tumor in the brain. Selpercatinib treatment was selected. The patient had no history of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) use and never developed a more severe generalized eczema-like flakiness and dry skin.

The patient was prescribed 4 weeks of selpercatinib as a subsequent treatment, starting selpercatinib 160 mg orally twice daily on April 17, 2024. Around May 15, 2024, the patient developed erythematous papules on the face and neck, accompanied by intolerable itching. Routine blood tests revealed no abnormalities. The patient self-administered oral prednisone acetate tablets, 5 mg irregularly for over a week, which resolved the skin lesions on the face and neck. Eczema-like changes subsequently manifested on the abdomen, back, and extremities, with the most severe skin lesions observed on the hands, exhibiting significant cracking and desquamation.
