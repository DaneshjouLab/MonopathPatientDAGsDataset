Patient 1 was a 46-year-old man with a history of 50 pack-years of tobacco smoking, without diagnosed diseases, who was admitted to the Department of Pulmonary Diseases. He reported progressive tiredness in the last 5 months that at first did not bother him, and in the last 1.5 months had recurrent sub-febrile states, productive cough, and occasional dyspnea. Laboratory blood tests revealed a high white blood cell count and elevated C-reactive protein: WBC 16.9×109/l, NEU 13.8×109/l, CRP 91.6 mg/l. Chest X-ray revealed a large mass in the left lung, and extending to the mediastinum. A CT scan showed a nodular lesion in the left lung. Lung spirometry revealed moderate irreversible airflow obstruction: FEV1=2.30l, 61% of predicted value, FVC=3.71l, 78% of predicted value, FEV1/FVC=62.11%, and after 400 mcg of salbutamol FEV1=2.40l, 64% of predicted value, FVC=3.73l, 79% of predicted value, FEV1/FVC=64.21%. Because of the findings in the CT, bronchoscopy was performed, which showed an exophytic tumor in the ostium of the left upper-lobe bronchus, and a bronchial biopsy was taken from this tumor. Finally, squamous cell carcinoma was confirmed. He died 6 months after his diagnosis of lung cancer due to pneumonia complicated by COPD not responding to targeted antibiotic treatment.
