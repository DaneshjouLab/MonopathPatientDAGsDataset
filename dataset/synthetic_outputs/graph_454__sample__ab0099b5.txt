A 68-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma, treated since 2006, developed deep vein thrombosis and extensive pulmonary embolism in 2016, contributing to persistent dyspnoea. In 2017, he was diagnosed with non-resectable T3 N0 M1b (bilateral lung lesions and soft tissue chest wall metastasis) squamous subtype non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by image-guided biopsy. At the time of NSCLC diagnosis, his myeloma was reasonably controlled (partial response) with ongoing carfilzomib/daratumumab/dexamethasone 5th-line therapy. Prior myeloma treatments included lenalidomide, bortezomib, high-dose melphalan and autologous stem cell transplant, pomalidomide and dexamethasone, thalidomide, cisplatin, adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide (DT-PACE), to which the myeloma was either refractory or the patient intolerant due to toxicity. Relevant medical history included chronic thrombocytopenia of likely autoimmune pathogenesis. Patient performance status at time of NSCLC diagnosis was ECOG 1. NSCLC biomarker analysis revealed PDL1 expression of 70% (22C3 clone). NGS analysis showed no actionable oncogenic drivers, a TMB of 83 mutations/Mb, and TP53G245N and S121F mutations. Pembrolizumab therapy was commenced at 200 mg every 21 days for NSCLC. First re-staging after three months of pembrolizumab showed a partial response of the NSCLC lesions. The patient developed a grade 1 skin rash with pruritus. However, the myeloma did not respond to pembrolizumab, and paraprotein levels continued to rise over 10 months of concurrent pembrolizumab and anti-myeloma therapy until clinical progression, with transfusion-dependent anaemia and severe dyspnoea and fatigue, resulting in reduced performance status [Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 2].
