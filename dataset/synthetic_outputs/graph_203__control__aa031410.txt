A 72-year-old man (height, 166.3 cm; weight, 58.6 kg) with a history of cerebral infarction, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, and constrictive pericarditis, and no history of allergic reaction, was admitted with right heart failure. He had no history of CNS disorders, but his daughter had schizophrenia. He was receiving alectinib for ALK-positive NSCLC. On admission, computed tomography showed ground-glass opacity in the lungs, leading to the discontinuation of alectinib due to suspected drug-induced lung injury, and steroids were initiated. After the lung injury improved, alectinib was switched to lorlatinib 100 mg/d. At the time of switching to lorlatinib, both renal and liver function were normal.

On day 4 after lorlatinib was initiated, the patient experienced auditory hallucinations, followed by visual hallucinations 3 days later. The hallucinations were diagnosed as grade 2-3 CNS disorders. He reported hearing music playing outside the window or close to him, loudly or faintly, and involving familiar and unfamiliar tunes. He noted the music was faint when talking with people. The visual hallucinations ranged from mild, such as curtains approaching him up close and stuffed animals emerging from the ceiling, to severe, including his bed turning into an airplane or train and seeing a variety of magnificent views and cityscapes from the window. Concomitant medications were vonoprazan fumarate (10 mg/d), a precipitated calcium carbonate/cholecalciferol/magnesium carbonate mixture (2 tablets/d), rosuvastatin calcium (2.5 mg/d), aspirin (100 mg/d), a trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole mixture (1 tablets/d), magnesium oxide (990 mg/d), prednisolone (10 mg/d), and torasemide (4 mg/d).

Lorlatinib was discontinued the day after the onset of visual hallucinations, but both the visual and auditory hallucinations persisted for a further 3 days before disappearing on day 4 after discontinuation. Lorlatinib was restarted at 50 mg/d on day 5 after discontinuation, and the visual and auditory hallucinations reappeared the following day. He reported that the visual hallucinations were less powerful and that the auditory hallucinations were about half as loud as before. The specific visual hallucinations included curtains approaching him up close, stuffed animals emerging from the ceiling, and ceiling lights moving. The auditory hallucinations included various pieces of music playing outside the window and above his head. He was diagnosed with grade 1 CNS disorder. There were no findings suspicious for brain metastasis and no medications that could cause delirium. Psychiatrists determined that delirium was unlikely because of the lack of cognitive decline and disorientation.

Six months later, his general condition deteriorated and lorlatinib was discontinued. However, grade 1 auditory hallucinations persisted, sometimes as singing but mostly instrumental and with familiar and unfamiliar pieces. He often experienced these hallucinations in the morning, during quiet times before going to bed, and when it was quiet during the daytime.
