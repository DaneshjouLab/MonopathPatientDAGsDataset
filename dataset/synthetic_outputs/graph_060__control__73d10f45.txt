A patient with a history of early-stage lung cancer surgery seven years prior presented with a constellation of neurological symptoms including behavior abnormalities, altered consciousness, and seizures over the preceding five months. Initial investigations, including head CT and MRI, revealed multiple punctate calcifications in the brain. After ruling out infectious and autoimmune encephalitis through relevant testing and ineffective treatment trials, the patient's symptoms were suspected to be related to brain and meningeal metastasis from lung cancer. Further diagnostic workup, including a brain biopsy and genetic testing, confirmed the diagnosis of metastatic lung adenocarcinoma with an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) L858R mutation. The patient was subsequently treated with osimertinib, a targeted therapy, which resulted in significant improvement of their symptoms. The patient had no history of brain radiation and no evidence of extracranial recurrence or metastasis until the onset of neurological symptoms. The diagnosis of lung cancer brain metastasis was confirmed via surgical biopsy of the brain calcifications approximately six months after the onset of psychiatric symptoms.
