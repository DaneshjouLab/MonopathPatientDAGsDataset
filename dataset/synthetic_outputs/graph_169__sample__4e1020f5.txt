A 41-year-old female presented with repeated dyspnea without other discomforts 3 years before admission and was diagnosed with pneumothorax, which was relieved after a thoracoscopic bullectomy. Pneumothorax occurred again 2 years before admission, and thoracoscopy revealed pleural masses distributed along the mediastinum, transverse diaphragm, and lateral chest wall which were subsequently removed. Pathological examination showed epithelioid mesothelioma. The patient presented with a 6-month history of a chest wall mass being detected after resection of a right pleural mesothelioma 2 years previously. Six months before admission, a right chest wall mass with poor mobility was detected. The patient underwent a right open pleurectomy with argon lavage of the thoracic cavity. Thoracic perfusion chemotherapy was not performed due to communication of the bilateral thoracic cavity. The patient received four cycles of chemotherapy (cisplatin and pemetrexed). One year before admission, a chest CT revealed a 7 mm solid nodule beside the horizontal fissure at the right lung. The patient received two cycles of chemotherapy (carboplatin and pemetrexed). FDG-PET/CT scan showed a right chest wall mass (8.9 cm x 3.7 cm, SUV max 3.3) with a blurred boundary. Pleura adjacent to the right-posterior mediastinum had become thickened and filled with encapsulated effusion (SUV max 27).
