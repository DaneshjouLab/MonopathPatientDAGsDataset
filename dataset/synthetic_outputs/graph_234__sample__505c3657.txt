A 75-year-old female presented to the emergency room with frequent episodes of hemoptysis that began a week prior to presentation. The patient also reported a dry cough for the past three months. Her medical history included arterial hypertension grade II, chronic heart failure class II (NYHA) with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction, mild aortic stenosis, mild aortic regurgitation, moderate mitral regurgitation, and dyslipidemia. She was a non-smoker with no occupational exposure.

On examination, the superficial lymph node system was not palpable. Vesicular murmurs were auscultated on both sides, with infrequent crackles in the lower part of the left hemithorax. Oxygen saturation level in the surrounding air was 94%. Rhythmic heart sounds were present, with a systolic murmur in the aortic area that extended to the carotid arteries and a systolic murmur in the mitral area, irradiating to the axilla.

Vitals were as follows: Blood pressure 140/90 mmHg, heart rate 80 bpm. The abdomen was painless on palpation; intestinal transit and diuresis were normal. The patient was on long-term treatment with bisoprolol, perindopril, indapamide, acetylsalicylic acid, and atorvastatin. Initial biological evaluation did not identify significant pathological changes.

A negative RT-PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 was obtained. ECG showed sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 80 bpm, normal QRS axis, Q waves in the DII, DIII, and aVF derivations, and no alterations in the ventricular repolarization phase. Chest X-ray showed no pleural or pulmonary lesions. Contrast-enhanced CT of the chest revealed a 41/24/30 mm multiseptate lung tumor with multicystic appearance and peripheral gadolinophilia in the lower left lobe, with direct communication to the bronchial lumen, associated with bronchial dilatations and discrete ground-glass areas.

Further CT scan of the chest showed a partially solid spiculiform image (22/18/20 mm) in the left Fowler segment, extending to the parietal pleura and oblique fissure, exerting a retractive effect. No mediastinal adenopathies were identified. The 41/24/30 mm lung tumor was confirmed in the lower left lobe.

Contrast-enhanced chest computed tomography, venous phase showed a multiseptate lung tumor with multicystic appearance, located in the lower left lobe. Lung adenocarcinoma was diagnosed, located at the level of the left Fowler segment. Contrast-enhanced chest computed tomography showed a partially solid spiculiform tumor with maximum dimensions of 22/18/20 mm, located in the left Fowler segment.

Contrast-enhanced chest computed tomography, arterial phase showed a partially solid spiculiform tumor that sends extensions to the parietal pleura and oblique fissure, exerting a retractive effect on both structures. Bronchoscopy revealed normal trachea and carina, a right bronchial tree without proliferative elements in the endoscopically approachable area, and a left bronchial tree without proliferative elements but with sero-hematous secretions at the level of a branch corresponding to the anterior segment of the left lower lobe.

Subsequently, the patient experienced a significant hemoptypic event. CT examination of the chest revealed a dimensional growth of the two pulmonary lesions previously identified. Contrast-enhanced cerebral and abdominalâ€“pelvic CT scans revealed the absence of metastases. A decision was made for surgical intervention.
