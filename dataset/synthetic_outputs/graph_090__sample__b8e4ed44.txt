In April 2023, a 58-year-old man presented with epigastric pain that had persisted for one week. He had no significant medical or family history. The patient's epigastric pain led to further investigation via endoscopic ultrasonography, which revealed a 6-cm mass 25 cm into the esophagus from the incisors. The mass was invading the muscularis propria, with the thickest section measuring approximately 5.9 mm, and the outer membrane remained smooth. Two hypoechoic nodules were also observed in the mediastinum next to the lesioned esophagus. The mass identified via endoscopic ultrasonography was biopsied for further evaluation. Biopsy specimen H&E staining showed heterogeneous hyperplasia of the squamous epithelium with keratinized pearl formation, leading to a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The diagnosis of SCC prompted pretreatment contrast-enhanced CT imaging, which revealed thickening of the middle esophagus wall with mild uneven enhancement, and a homogeneously enhanced nodular shadow approximately 3mm in diameter on the left side of the lesion. No other metastatic foci were observed in the abdominal CT and cranial magnetic resonance imaging. Pretreatment imaging was followed by blood tests to assess tumor markers. The levels of neuron-specific enolase, carbohydrate antigen 19-9, carbohydrate antigen 125 and carcinoembryonic antigen were normal in the blood before treatment. Lab results and imaging findings were used to determine the patient's clinical stage. The patient's pretreatment clinical stage was cT2N1M0, stage II. Based on the patient's stage, neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy with tislelizumab was initiated in May 2023 and continued through June 2023. The patient received 200 mg of tislelizumab, an anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) drug.
