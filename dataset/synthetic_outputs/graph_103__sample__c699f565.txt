In September 2020, an 80-year-old Caucasian male presented with a sudden onset of painless swelling of the right testis, which had been present for approximately 3 weeks. His past medical history was minimal, and he had no known history of asbestos exposure. Clinical examination revealed the absence of palpable inguinal or pelvic adenopathy bilaterally, and the left testis and hemi-scrotum appeared clinically normal. Initial conservative management with antibiotics failed to resolve the swelling. Urgent ultrasonography revealed a complex cystic-solid lesion in the right scrotum invading the right testicle. Testicular tumour markers, including alpha-fetoprotein, lactate dehydrogenase, and beta human choriongonadotropin levels, were within normal limits.

Due to the persistent swelling and ultrasound findings, the patient underwent a radical inguinal orchidectomy without complications and recovered well. Pathology of the specimen revealed malignant mesothelioma of the testis. Macroscopic examination of the radical inguinal orchidectomy specimen revealed a hydrocele containing yellowish clear fluid and a large primarily exophytic mass (5.2 × 4.5 × 0.5 cm) on the surface of the tunica vaginalis and tunica albuginea, predominantly involving the latter. The surface of the tunica vaginalis was studded by multifocal papillary tumour nodules (0.1–0.7 cm in diameter). Several small foci of stromal invasion and an additional 1.5 cm satellite lesion were noted. The mass was negative for invasion of the testes, epididymis, and rete testis with negative resection margins of the spermatic cord for tumour involvement; however, lymphovascular invasion was positive.

Microscopic examination of the malignant neoplasm revealed epithelioid cells arranged in papillary, tubulopapillary, and solid patterns. The cells were rounded to cuboidal, containing eosinophilic cytoplasm and pleomorphic, prominent nuclei with significant mitotic activity. Cellular atypia of the mesothelial surface, indicative of in situ neoplasm, was also noted. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining showed the tumour was strongly positive for pan-cytokeratin, calretinin, D2-40, WT-1, with focal staining for CD99, and negative for cytokeratin 5 and 6.
