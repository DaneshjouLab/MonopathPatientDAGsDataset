This case report focuses on the treatment of lung cancer, particularly Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene rearrangements and brain metastases. Several instances highlight the use of ALK-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as crizotinib and alectinib in managing these conditions.

The report details cases of advanced NSCLC with brain metastases, where patients were initially treated with crizotinib. In some instances, alectinib was used as a subsequent treatment option, potentially after crizotinib resistance or progression. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) was also utilized in some cases, either alongside or after conventional treatments like crizotinib and erlotinib.

The report also mentions instances of severe complications, including cranial lesions, severe liver damage, and kidney damage, potentially related to the disease progression or treatment side effects. Some patients presented with severe conditions due to extensive brain metastases.

The cases highlight the challenges in treating ALK-positive NSCLC, especially when it has metastasized to the central nervous system (CNS), including the brain. The effectiveness of crizotinib treatment in managing brain metastases (BM) is a recurring theme. The report also touches upon the importance of identifying ALK rearrangements in NSCLC patients to guide treatment decisions.
