A 78-year-old male with a 25-pack-year smoking history was diagnosed with clinical stage IIA lung cancer in the left upper lobe. The patient underwent lobectomy combined with chest wall resection. Histopathological examination indicated pleomorphic carcinoma of the lung (pT3N0M0, stage IIB, with chest wall invasion). The tumor was positive for the BRAF-V600E mutation in the AmoyDx pan lung cancer PCR panel, with a 95% tumor proportion score of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) staining. Two months after lobectomy, the patient was admitted to the hospital emergently due to abdominal pain and difficulty eating. Appendicitis was initially suspected, and antibiotic treatment was initiated. Follow-up CT revealed jejunal intussusception, dilatation of the upper small intestine, mass lesions in the pancreatic head, appendix, and hepatic flexure, and multiple enlarged abdominal lymph nodes. Electrolyte levels were assessed: sodium 140 mEq/L, potassium 3.8 mEq/L, chloride 107 mEq/L, magnesium 2.0 mg/dL, corrected calcium 9.6 mg/dL. No electrolyte abnormalities were observed. The patient underwent enteroscopy. Endoscopic findings revealed a neoplastic lesion in the upper jejunum with a narrowed lumen. Histology confirmed a malignant lesion consistent with metastatic pleomorphic carcinoma of the lung. The intussusception was reduced, and an ileus tube was placed.
