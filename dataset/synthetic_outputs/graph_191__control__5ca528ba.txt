Pulmonary mucous gland adenoma (MGA) is an exceptionally rare benign tumor. Even with the assistance of 18 F-FDG PET/CT, the accurate diagnosis of MGA as lung cancer remains challenging. Only one case of fluorodeoxyglucose(FDG)-avid pulmonary mucous gland adenoma and two case of low FDG uptake pulmonary mucous gland adenoma have been reported in English literature, while a single case of moderately increased FDG uptake pulmonary mucous gland adenoma has been documented in French literature. To minimize misdiagnosis and select appropriate treatment strategies, it is crucial to comprehensively analyze its 18 F-FDG PET/CT manifestations in conjunction with clinical symptoms and pathological findings.

This report presents a case involving a 70-year-old woman with clinical manifestations of persistent cough and sputum with an FDG-avid mucous gland adenoma.
