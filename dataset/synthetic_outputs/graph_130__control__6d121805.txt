A 48-year-old female, active smoker (36 pack-years), was diagnosed with sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) in 2004. The patient's LAM was not associated with tuberous sclerosis complex. Initial computed tomography (CT) of the chest revealed diffuse bilateral cysts with thin walls that are typical of LAM, in addition to retroperitoneal involvement with left iliac, hypogastric, and latero-aortic angiomyolipomas. In April 2004, a biopsy of a retroperitoneal mass revealed fusiform proliferation of smooth muscle-differentiated cells within a rich vascular and adipose stroma, with strong positivity for HMB45 staining, evocative of an angiomyolipoma. In 2006, the patient developed New York Heart Association Class II dyspnea on exercise, along with a chronic cough. From 2006 to 2007, she received several sequential anti-estrogen treatments, specifically tamoxifen and letrozole combined with triptorelin, with stable respiratory function. In 2007, the patient exhibited lung function deterioration, which led to the prescription of the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus (2 mg once daily), resulting in the disappearance of retroperitoneal lesions. The patient later suffered from metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung. Third-line therapy with nivolumab was started in 2015, with a major partial response. Due to pulmonary function alterations, sirolimus was also reinitiated in 2017 in conjunction with nivolumab, without any undesirable effects and a major partial response continuing up to May 2018.
