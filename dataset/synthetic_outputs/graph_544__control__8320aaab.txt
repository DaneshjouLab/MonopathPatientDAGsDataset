Intraoperative tracheobronchial injury is a rare but serious complication in lung and esophageal surgery that requires early and skilled repair [1–7]. The main cause of intraoperative tracheobronchial injury is anatomical errors, which may include accidental tracheobronchial transection caused by incorrect identification of anatomical structures and accidental bronchial membrane injury caused by dissection of adjacent bronchial structures. Intraoperative tracheobronchial injuries can be recognized directly by the surgeon or by means of a water submersion test and can be repaired by complete anatomic restoration of the lesion with interrupted or running resorbable sutures1 or coverage of the lesion with an intercostal muscle flap [8]. If tracheobronchial injury is not recognized during surgery, it may cause infection, hemoptysis, dyspnea, etc. Injuries in the tracheobronchial tree might occur in different ways. Erroneous transections to the bronchi could lead to additional major surgeries and potentially severe complications [1]. Amit Borah et al. reported a case in which the superior segment bronchus of the right lower lobe was erroneously clipped by a surgical clip during basal segmental resection [12]. Dissection of adjacent bronchial structures may cause bronchial membrane injury, especially during the process of lymph node dissection. Kawamura et al. reported a case in which the membranous portion of the intermediate bronchus was injured approximately 5 mm in length while dissecting subcarinal lymph nodes [14]. Even though the fistula was closed by knotted suture using 4 − 0 polydioxanone and covered with a pericardial fat pad, postoperative bronchoscopy revealed a slit-like bronchopleural fistula at the intermediate bronchus.

The patient was a 58-year-old woman who presented with a chief complaint of cough for 3 months. Pathology of this patient suggested that the nodule was a minimally invasive adenocarcinoma with no metastasis to the lymph nodes. The postoperative course was uneventful, and no adverse events were recorded. In this case, no adverse events related to ICG inhalation occurred.
