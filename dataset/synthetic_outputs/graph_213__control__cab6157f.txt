A patient presented with abdominal distention and pain. Examination revealed an intraperitoneal mass. Cytological analysis of peritoneal fluid revealed singly scattered clusters of large pleomorphic cells with an epithelioid morphology, raising suspicion for malignancy. Initial differential diagnoses included spindle cell neoplasm, leiomyosarcoma, and dedifferentiated liposarcoma. Further investigation led to a diagnosis of dedifferentiated liposarcoma. The patient subsequently developed metastatic deposits of dedifferentiated liposarcoma, another intraperitoneal mass, and malignant effusions. The differential diagnosis at this point included spindle cell neoplasm, dedifferentiated liposarcoma, and pleomorphic liposarcoma. Ultimately, the patient was diagnosed with retroperitoneal dedifferentiated liposarcoma.
