A 73-year-old man was admitted for a routine health check and found to have a lung nodule by chest X-ray. He had a history of smoking one pack of cigarettes a day for 20 years, but quit 9 months prior to admission. He denied chest pain, hoarseness, hemoptysis, cough, and difficulty breathing. Physical examination revealed normal breath sounds in both lung fields. Laboratory test results were within normal range, as were lung function test and cardiovascular examination results. A contrast-enhanced CT scan revealed a soft tissue mass measuring 2.4 cm Ã— 3 cm in the lower lobe of the right lung. Bronchoscopy did not show evidence of pathology. The patient underwent lobectomy by utilizing a three-port video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS). Pathological diagnosis revealed small cell lung cancer combined with adenocarcinoma. The lesion did not invade the adjacent tissue structure. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was followed up for 2 weeks without evidence of recurrence.
