A 74-year-old female patient with stage IVa *EGFR L858R*-mutated lung adenocarcinoma experienced progression following multiple lines of *EGFR*-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy. She was subsequently treated with pembrolizumab in combination with pemetrexed and carboplatin (immunochemotherapy or ICT). Following four cycles of pembrolizumab-based ICT, the patient exhibited a significant reduction in tumor burden and mediastinal lymph node involvement, as confirmed by PET-CT. Surgical resection revealed a pathological complete response (pCR) with no viable tumor cells present. Microenvironment analysis of tumor samples obtained post-progression on targeted therapy demonstrated that more than 50% of tumor cells expressed programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1), accompanied by higher infiltration of programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1)+ CD8+ T cells and PD-L1+ CD68+ macrophages in the tumor area compared to the stromal area. Resected samples showed substantial infiltration of CD45+ immune cells, CD8+ T lymphocytes, CD68+ macrophages, and immature tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs). The patient achieved a pathological complete response (pCR) and prolonged survival.
