A 54-year-old Chinese male presented with abdominal distension, fatigue, and weight loss. He was initially diagnosed with gastro and duodenal inflammation and anemia at a local hospital based on gastroscopy findings. An abdominal ultrasound at that time showed no signs of abnormality. Within two weeks, his symptoms aggravated. A preoperative contrast-enhanced CT scan revealed multiple polypoid lesions in the small intestine causing intussusceptions and obstruction. No masses were seen in the lung, liver, or pancreas. A laparotomy was performed, revealing approximately 1,000 mL of ascites in the peritoneal cavity and many polypoid lumps in the small bowel with enlarged regional lymph nodes. Segmental resection of the jejunum and proximal ileum (300 cm total, distal margin 160 cm to the ileocecal valve) was performed, along with removal of seven mesentery lymph nodes. More than 100 round polypoid masses (1.5-2.6 cm diameter) were found dispersing along the resected intestinal lumen. Metastases were found in all resected lymph nodes. Microscopy showed pleomorphic cells with giant nuclei and epithelioid cells in complex form without clear separation. The lesion composition was 30% epithelioid.
