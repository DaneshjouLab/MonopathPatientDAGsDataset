A patient presented with chest pain, back pain, leg weakness, and numbness. Initial investigations revealed spinal cord compression. Further workup, including protein electrophoresis, identified IgG lambda paraproteinaemia. A bone marrow biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of plasmablastic myeloma, a subtype of multiple myeloma. The patient also exhibited signs of anaemia, hypercalcaemia, renal dysfunction, and bone and skeletal involvement, all consistent with multiple myeloma.

Differential diagnoses considered included lung cancer, metastatic lung cancer presenting with pulmonary nodules, primary lung cancer, lung metastases, carcinoid tumours, and pulmonary hamartoma. The patient also presented with abdominal distention. Spinal metastatic disease was also considered in the differential. A pulmonary tumour and pleural effusion were noted.

Treatment was initiated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy, including bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisolone. The patient subsequently underwent autologous stem cell transplant. During treatment, the patient developed steroid-induced diabetes, requiring insulin. The patient also experienced ureteric calculi and pathological fractures. The patient also presented with proptosis.
