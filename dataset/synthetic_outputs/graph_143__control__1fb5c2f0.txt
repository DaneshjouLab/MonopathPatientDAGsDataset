A patient presented with pulmonary masses and lymphadenopathy, raising suspicion for thoracic malignancy. Diagnostic workup included fine needle aspiration and percutaneous core biopsies of the pulmonary masses and lymph nodes. The differential diagnosis considered included Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, Small Cell Lung Cancer, suspected infection, Hepatocellular Cancer, Hodgkin Lymphoma, and Malignant Melanoma.

Following the biopsies, pathology results revealed non-small cell lung cancer and T cell lymphoma. Transthoracic biopsies were performed. Complications arose, including pneumothoracies, requiring chest tube placement. Chest ultrasound was utilized to assess lung sliding. A chest radiograph was also performed.

During the procedures, local anesthetic was administered. Further fine needle aspiration and core biopsy were conducted. Post-biopsy, the patient experienced hemoptysis and a vasovagal episode. The biopsy sites were monitored. Transthoracic target biopsies were performed using CT guided techniques. Antibiotics were administered, likely to address a suspected infection.
