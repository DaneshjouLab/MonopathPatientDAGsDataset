A 59-year-old woman presented with a cough. A lung CT scan revealed a 52x53 mm space-occupying lesion in the left lower lobe accompanied by peripheral obstructive inflammation, atelectasis, and multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum, located behind and below the left main bronchus, as well as adjacent to the left lower pulmonary vein. Lung cancer with hilar lymph node metastasis was diagnosed, and R0 resection was deemed not possible. A lung puncture biopsy revealed keratinized squamous cell carcinoma. Immunohistochemical staining was positive for CK5/6, P63, and P40, and Ki-67 positive (10%), and negative for Napsin A and CK7. The patient was diagnosed with left lower lobe squamous cell carcinoma (T3N2bM0, Stage IIIB).

Treatment was initiated with six cycles of albumin-bound paclitaxel (100 mg/m² on day 1, day 8, and day 15), cisplatin (75 mg/m² on day 1), and carrelizumab (200 mg on day 1). A chest CT reexamination revealed that the left lower lung lesion had significantly reduced to approximately 23x25 mm. Lymph nodes remained visible.

Following chemotherapy, the patient underwent radiotherapy, with a dose of 2 Gy per fraction, administered over a total of 30 fractions. After ten fractions of radiotherapy, the patient developed dyspnea and fever, with a maximum temperature of 38.5°C. Re-examination of the chest CT showed that the left lower lung lesion had significantly enlarged to a size of 50 × 51 mm. A lung puncture biopsy of the enlarged part of the lesion was performed, and the pathological findings of the biopsy indicated squamous cell carcinoma. Immunohistochemical staining was positive for CK5/6, P63, and P40, and negative for Napsin A, Syn, and TTF-1. Delayed hyperprogressive disease (HPD) after 5 months of immunotherapy was confirmed.
