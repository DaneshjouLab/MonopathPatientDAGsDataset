A 32-year-old female presented with weakness in her right upper arm lasting for two weeks. Physical examination was unremarkable, other than grade 3 weakness in her right upper limb. The patient's right arm weakness progressed, leading to hospitalization and diagnosis of acute venous thromboembolism of the right arm. Anti-coagulation therapy was initiated. Computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, along with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, were performed to investigate the cause of the weakness and thromboembolism. Imaging revealed multiple nodules suggestive of extensive metastasis and a 1.9 cm left lung mass consistent with lung primary origin. Liver and chest wall biopsies were performed, revealing poorly differentiated lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Core biopsy of left chest wall nodule also revealed poorly differentiated LUAD with tumor cells positive for pan-keratin and TTF-1 and negative for ER, PR, CDX2, WT1, PAX-8, synaptophysin and chromogranin. The patient received palliative radiation therapy for C5-C7 spine metastases (10 fractions of 300 cGy each) and started on carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy while awaiting molecular profiling results. Patient expired 13 days after chemotherapy due to disseminated metastatic lung adenocarcinoma and cancer-associated complications, including severe respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal failure caused by Trousseau syndrome and embolic stroke, despite continuing hydrocortisone combined with antibiotic therapy for the last two days preceding her death. Primary cancer was left lung late-stage lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) with more than 20 synchronous metastases. Tumor contents and major/minor copy number changes were estimated by Sequenza (v2.1.2). Somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) was first called using MuTect version 1.1.4, VarScan 2 and Strelka2 with default setting, respectively. Nonsynonymous mutations were identified from WES profiling and the binding affinities with patient-restricted MHC Class I molecules of all possible 9- and 10-mer peptides spanning the nonsynonymous mutations were evaluated with the NetMHC3.4 algorithm based on HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C alleles of each patient. Two sets of PCRs were performed.
