A patient presented with a constellation of symptoms including cough, chest pain, and intermittent fever. Physical examination revealed coarse breathing sounds, rales, and pleural friction sounds. Notably, cardiac dullness was detected on the right side of the chest, indicating a right-sided heart, suggestive of visceral inversion.

The patient's history revealed a prior diagnosis of Kartagener syndrome, characterized by visceral inversion, sinusitis, and bronchiectasis. Imaging studies revealed signs of chronic inflammation and bronchiectasis, as well as nodules, pleural thickening, and calcification. Further investigation of the sinuses revealed right maxillary sinusitis and ethmoid sinus involvement, along with a nasal soft tissue shadow, deviated nasal septum, and turbinate hypertrophy, suggestive of polyps.

Given the respiratory symptoms, a lung infection was suspected. Bronchial phlegm embolism and a foreign body obstruction were considered. A bronchoscopy was performed to visualize the bronchial tubes. This revealed a polypoid neoplasm with necrosis. The lesion was biopsied.

Histopathological examination of the biopsied tissue revealed cancer cells. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was collected and examined using H&E stain. This revealed heterogeneous epithelioid cells, dense cells, and deeply stained nuclei with little cytoplasm, further supporting the diagnosis of Small-cell lung cancer.
