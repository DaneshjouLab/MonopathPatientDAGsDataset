An 81-year-old female with a history of hypertension, cervical spondylosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease presented with a three to four-week history of a 2.5 cm lower midline neck lump. She denied any allergies and was independent with activities of daily living. Her social, occupational, and family history were unremarkable, and she had given up smoking over 20 years ago.

The patient reported mild lethargy and an ultrasound scan indicated an infectious sebaceous cyst. She was discharged with oral antibiotics.

Two weeks later, the patient represented with an increase in lump size, associated with pain and blood oozing from the mass (estimated at around 500 ml). The lump demonstrated a fungating ulcerated appearance associated with a foul-smelling discharge.

Examination revealed no craniofacial or cervical lymphadenopathy. Oral cavity and flexible nasendoscopy were unremarkable. Paraprotein and virology screen were negative. A sample was negative for microscopy, culture and sensitivity, and acid-fast bacilli. Histology confirmed squamous cell carcinoma with PD-L1 almost 90%.

Immunohistochemistry results were: AE1/3, CK7, and P40 positive; CK20, TTF1, CD56, and p16 negative. Cross-sectional imaging of the neck, thorax, and abdomen reported an anterior soft tissue mass measuring 6.1 cm, a left upper lobe mass, right lung metastases, and a subcutaneous metastatic deposit in the neck.

A pulmonology multi-disciplinary meeting outcome favored surgical intervention, but the plastic surgery team deemed surgery too extensive. An oncology opinion was sought.

A decision was made to commence palliative radiotherapy followed by Pembrolizumab immunotherapy. The anterior neck mass had grown to 10 cm in size and was protruding 8 cm outwards from the neck. The mass was fungating and ulcerated.

After one cycle of radio-immunotherapy, a dramatic clinical response was observed via antero-posterior and lateral view imaging.
