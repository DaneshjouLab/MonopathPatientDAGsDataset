A 39-year-old man presented with episodes of dyspnea 6 months prior to hospital admission. Past medical and family histories were unremarkable. The patient developed multiple pulmonary nodules in a diffuse pattern, accompanied by bilateral pleural effusion, as revealed by chest computed tomography (CT). Pleural effusion was aspirated and found to be bloody exudate. Pleural biopsy was performed and microscopic examination showed portions of neoplastic tissue, as well as fragments of fibrous connective tissue with mesothelium lining infiltrated by a neoplasm composed of large cells with round to oval nuclei and a moderate amount of clear cytoplasm. Mild nuclear pleomorphism and intercellular capillary-sized vessels were two noteworthy findings. Immunohistochemistry study revealed tumor cells were strongly positive for CD10, Carbonic anhydrase IX, EMA, Pan CK and showed negative results for CK7, CK20, NapsinA, TTF1, Calretinin, WT1, CDX2, Inhibin and PSA. Tumor was diagnosed to be compatible with metastatic RCC, of the clear cell type. Abdominal contrast computed tomography (CT) showed a 3 cm right renal mass. Partial nephrectomy to remove the mass was performed. Histopathology of the mass revealed clear cell.
