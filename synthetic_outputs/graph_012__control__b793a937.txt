Six years ago, the patient presented with left cervical lymphadenopathy of unknown origin. Subsequent investigations revealed suspected cervical lymph node metastasis of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Five years ago, the patient underwent total thyroidectomy and left cervical lymph node dissection. Histopathological findings revealed multiple papillary thyroid microcarcinomas (pT1a [m], pEx0, pN1b 4/10, pStage IVA) with negative surgical margins. Two years ago, a nodule in the right upper lobe of the lung was identified and followed up with chest CT scans. Based on these findings, the patient was suspected of having primary lung cancer. The diagnosis of adenocarcinoma was confirmed, and a right upper lobectomy with mediastinal lymph node dissection (ND-1b) was performed. The histopathological examination findings revealed atypical cells with hyperchromatic nuclei of variable sizes and eosinophilic cytoplasm, proliferating in papillary, acinar, micropapillary, and lepidic patterns. The findings were consistent with papillary adenocarcinoma (papillary 60%, acinar 20%, micropapillary 10%, lepidic 10%; WHO Grade 2), leading to a diagnosis of secondary lung cancer (pT1cN0cM0, pStage IA3). Additionally, scattered clusters of tumor cells with nuclear grooves, intranuclear inclusions, and ground-glass nuclei, proliferating in a papillary pattern, were observed near the secondary lung cancer. Immunohistochemistry showed thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) positivity, paired box 8 (PAX8) positivity, and thyroglobulin positivity. Similar findings were observed in the resected right upper lobe specimen, suggesting multiple pulmonary metastases from PTC.
