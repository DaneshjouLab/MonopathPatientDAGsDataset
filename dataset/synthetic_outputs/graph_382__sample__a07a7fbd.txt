A 71-year-old male presented with persistent anterior chest wall pain and bracing during coughing. Examination revealed pinpoint tenderness over the sternum. A CT scan revealed a 5.4 x 4.7 x 3.9 cm lesion in the left lung hilum and a 2.5 x 4.1 x 2.4 cm osteolytic destructive lesion at the sternal manubrium, surrounded by partially destroyed anterior and posterior cortical bone. Biopsy of the lung lesion confirmed squamous cell carcinoma. The patient reported pain with a numerical rating scale (NRS) of 9, with no symptom improvement with oral narcotics. Percutaneous osteoplasty (POP) was performed with two punctures at the lesion sites. Two needles were inserted into the lesion successively at a 45Â° inclination using an inferior to superior approach, and 2.5 mL of cement was injected into the sternal lesion. An immediate post-procedure CT scan demonstrated good cement distribution in the lesion and slight leakage along the posterior cortical margin. The patient experienced significant pain relief after the procedure. NRS scores were decreased to 4, 3, 3, and 3 at the 1-week, 1-month follow-ups.
