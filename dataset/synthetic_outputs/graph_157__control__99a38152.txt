A 51-year-old female presented to the clinic in June 2019 with a one-month history of left-sided chest pain, cough, sputum production, and hemoptysis. Her performance status was rated as 1. She had a 20-year smoking history of 5 cigarettes per day. Physical examination revealed decreased breath sounds in the left lung.

Initial investigations, including complete blood count and blood biochemistry, were unremarkable except for an elevated cytokeratin fragment -211 (Cyf-211) level of 3.78 ng/mL. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan on June 16, 2019, revealed a 76 mm Ã— 60 mm mass in the left hilum and upper lobe, suspicious for malignancy, with close proximity to the left pulmonary artery. The CT also showed left upper lobe carcinomatous lymphangitis, scattered nodules in the left lung suggestive of metastasis, mediastinal lymph node enlargement in zone 6, and a small left pleural effusion, along with old fractures of the right 2nd-4th ribs.

A bronchoscopic biopsy performed at the reporting hospital revealed a biphasic, low-grade malignant mesenchymal tumor with abundant cells and vessels, raising suspicion for epithelioid hemangioendothelioma or angiosarcoma.  A second opinion with immunohistochemistry at the Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, revealed scant tumor tissue with epithelioid and short spindle cell morphology and necrosis, suggesting a low-grade malignancy. Immunohistochemistry was uninformative, and a repeat biopsy was recommended.

Following the biopsy at the Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, the patient experienced acute massive hemorrhage, requiring emergent interventional hemostasis.

Upon returning to the reporting hospital, baseline investigations, including contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis, contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, and whole-body bone scan, were unremarkable.  Genetic testing of the biopsy tissue from the Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, revealed an echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene (ALK) fusion (EML4-ALK) mutation. A preliminary diagnosis of left lung adenocarcinoma, cT4N2M0 stage IIIb, ALK fusion positive, was made.
