A patient presented with an eczematous drug-eruption induced by selpercatinib after treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The patient exhibited symmetric erythematous papules and plaques all over the body, accompanied by dry, scaly skin, severe pruritus, and visible scarring. After systemic treatment with glucocorticoids, the patient's skin lesions were reduced. Selpercatinib is a RET-specific kinase inhibitor approved for RET-altered thyroid and NSCLC tumors. The rearranged during transfection (RET) gene was first identified as an oncogenic driver in NSCLC in 2012. KIF5B-RET is a common RET gene fusion partner in lung cancer. The LIBRETTO-001 trial indicated that selpercatinib has durable and safe anti-tumor activity and excellent intracranial efficacy. However, the trial also indicated that 44% of patients experienced treatment-emergent serious adverse events (SAEs), of which 11% were related to selpercatinib, with drug hypersensitivity being the most common treatment-related SAE. This case provides novel evidence for the treatment of selpercatinib-induced cutaneous eczematous reactions.
