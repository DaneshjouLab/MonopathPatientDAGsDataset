A 12-year-old boy presented for evaluation of a left apical lung aggressive destructive lesion. Since the initial presentation, the patient experienced a 5 kg weight loss and developed limited active and passive left shoulder movement to around 45 degrees. He was afebrile and hemodynamically stable. Physical examination revealed minimal tenderness over the left clavicle medially with no overlying skin inflammatory changes or chest wall swelling. Chest examination showed diminished air entry in the left upper zone. Mouth examination was normal. No organomegaly or systemic lymphadenopathy was noted. Complete blood count showed a white blood count of 10.9x10^9/L, hemoglobin of 103 g/L, and platelet count of 646x10^9/L. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 50 mm/hr. C reactive protein was 179mg/L. Chest X-ray showed left perihilar and upper lobe opacity. CT chest showed multiple left hilar lymph nodes with collapse of the left upper lobe and multiple pulmonary nodules with cavitation. Inflammatory changes were noted around the left rib with evidence of bone destruction and soft tissue inflammation. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a destructive left apical /supraclavicular enhancing lesion, which invaded the peripheral brachial plexopathy. A CT guided transthoracic tissue biopsy was performed, revealing chronic inflammatory cells. Culture of the biopsy sample showed light growth of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans.
