The clinical case report describes the toxic effects of various chemotherapy regimens and the criteria for treatment discontinuation.

Cisplatin (CDDP) is associated with severe toxic effects, including emesis, neurotoxicity, and renal damage. Carboplatin (CBDCA) is presented as a feasible alternative for CDDP-unfit patients, exhibiting significantly less toxicity, including reduced nausea and vomiting. CBDCA can also be administered to patients with mild renal impairment.

Nab-paclitaxel (nab-PTX) is compared to solvent-based paclitaxel (sb-PTX), with nab-PTX showing significantly less neuropathy, neutropenia, arthralgia, and myalgia.

Chemotherapy was discontinued if tumor recurrence was detected, or if the following criteria were met: a delay of more than 28 days for the next cycle, occurrence of drug-induced pneumonitis grade 2 or worse, detection of grade 4 or worse nonhematologic toxicities, or deterioration of the patientâ€™s condition due to severe toxicity or worsening comorbidities.

Two patients were excluded before intervention; one experienced a recurrence, and the other presented with new ground glass opacities before starting therapy.

First-step dose reduction was required in 6 patients (31.6%) due to grade 3 neutropenia (n=5) and physician's discretion (n=1).
