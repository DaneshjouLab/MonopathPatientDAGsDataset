In March of 2019, a 70-year-old female with a history of severe COPD, lung cancer status-post resection 15 years prior, and osteoporosis presented complaining of a lump on the right side of the upper back at the site of a previous right-sided thoracotomy where she underwent segmentectomy of the right upper lobe, and a right upper lobe lobectomy in 2004. No radiation or chemotherapy was administered at the time of surgery and she had remained cancer free with no reoccurrence based on her yearly pulmonary follow ups. She noticed the mass over the past year and although it was painless, it had raised concern due to its progressive size.

Physical exam revealed a 2-3 cm non-tender mass palpated under the surgical scar, becoming more prominent with scapular movement. Ultrasound showed a 3 cm complex mass. MRI showed a heterogeneously enhancing mass along the right posterior lateral chest wall, increased in size compared to a 2015 chest CT scan performed for lung cancer follow-up.

Differential diagnosis included elastofibroma, desmoid tumor, sarcoma, and recurrent lung cancer.

A CT-guided biopsy was performed.

Pathology report was consistent with a diagnosis of elastofibroma.

The oncologist recommended no surgical intervention due to the benign nature of the mass.
