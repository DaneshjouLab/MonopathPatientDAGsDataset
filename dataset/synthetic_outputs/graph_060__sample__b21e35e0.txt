A 67-year-old female presented with a 5-month history of speech and behavioral abnormalities, and 4 days of altered consciousness, and was admitted on July 1, 2024. The patient's symptoms began around February 2024 with self-talk and irritability, progressing to loss of self-care abilities by March 2024.

A head MRI on March 14, 2024, revealed multiple calcifications in the right frontal and bilateral temporal cortex, possible facial angiomatosis, scattered vascular white matter high signal in the periventricular white matter (Fazekas grade 2), and bilateral cerebral white matter sparse, empty sella.

A lumbar puncture on March 25, 2024, showed no significant abnormalities in CSF routine and biochemistry; autoimmune encephalitis and paraneoplastic syndrome antibody profiles were unremarkable.

A PET/CT scan on April 1, 2024, showed multiple patchy calcifications in the bilateral frontal (more pronounced on the right), bilateral parietal, and bilateral temporal lobes, with decreased sugar metabolism; decreased sugar metabolism in the left cerebellum, possible crossed diaschisis.

The patient was admitted to Huashan Hospital on April 10, 2024. At that time, she was still able to walk, experienced occasional urinary incontinence, but was unable to answer questions.

A subsequent lumbar puncture revealed colorless, clear CSF with WBC 6x10^6/L, RBC 1x10^6/L, Pandy's test negative. CSF biochemistry showed glucose 2.28 mmol/L (decreased), chloride 125 mmol/L, protein 553 mg/L, lactic acid 1.85 mmol/L, lactate dehydrogenase 76.00 U/L. Blood + CSF autoimmune encephalitis antibody 10 items examination, blood paraneoplastic syndrome antibody 22 items were negative, serum tissue based assay (TBA) antibody was positive, CSF TBA antibody was negative, leading to a consideration of autoimmune encephalitis.

The patient was treated with hormone sequential shock therapy and reduced to oral, but her symptoms did not improve significantly. She also received 5 plasma exchange treatments, and rituximab 100 and 500 mg immunotherapy on April 27 and April 28, respectively. After discharge, she continued oral hormone therapy, but her speech and behavior abnormalities did not improve significantly compared to before.

On June 27, 2024, the patient developed left corner of mouth twitching, followed by left limb convulsions to generalized convulsions, lasting about 3 hours.

On June 29, 2024, she presented to the emergency department of Huashan Hospital.
