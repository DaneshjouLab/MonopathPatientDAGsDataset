A patient presented with severe headache, visual loss, and vomiting. Initial symptoms included headache and visual acuity loss. The patient was diagnosed with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LC) secondary to non-small-cell lung cancer, which was found to have epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-activating mutations. The leptomeningeal carcinomatosis showed spinal dissemination and dural enhancement. The patient also exhibited signs of raised intracranial pressure, including papilledema. Cerebral venous sinus obstruction was identified, specifically occlusion and stenosis of the left transverse sinus, leading to delay of cerebral circulation.

Initially, the patient underwent lumbar punctures and a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt. Due to intractable headaches and visual symptoms, transverse sinus stenosis was suspected, potentially mimicking idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Venous sinus stenting, specifically left transverse sinus stent placement, was performed. Following the venous sinus stenting, the patient experienced symptom relief of severe headache. Furthermore, visual acuity improved, and the visual field was enlarged. The patient was also treated with osimertinib, targeting the EGFR mutation. The patient underwent venous sinus stenting.
