A 73-year-old female, a current smoker, presented with unsteadiness, headaches, and difficulty walking. Screening performed two years prior had revealed no abnormalities. The patient was subsequently diagnosed with treatment-naïve extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC) with multiple symptomatic brain metastases, including a >3.8-cm cerebellar lesion and two adjacent lesions.

Her Karnofsky performance scale (KPS) score was 60. Contrast-enhanced (CE) MRI of the brain revealed 15 enhancing lesions, including a large cerebellar lesion (≥3.8 cm, 17.7 cm3), all indicative of brain metastases (BMs). CE-T1-weighted images (CE-T1-WIs) showed a well-demarcated lesion with the dominance of the peripheral enhancement (3.8 cm in the maximum diameter, 17.7 cm3 in the volume). The lesion was observed as a heterogeneous intensity mass associated with mild perilesional edema on T2-WI. The lesion reached the cerebellar surface at the ventrolateral and caudal sides and appeared to extend beyond it in some areas. In the ipsilateral hemisphere, a 1.1 cm solid lesion (0.8 cm3) was located adjacent to the 3.8 cm lesion, and a 0.9 cm lesion (0.3 cm3) was located less than 1 cm away from the 3.8 cm lesion.

Brain radiotherapy and chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) were concurrently performed for the extensive-stage SCLC. Concurrent conventional whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) without local boost and chemoimmunotherapy resulted in remarkable regression of the brain metastases without local progression for 20 months. Thirteen days after the initial MRI scan, the neurological symptoms had stabilized. WBRT (30 Gy in 10 fractions) with two-dimensional irradiation using two opposed fields was initiated. Etoposide plus carboplatin (EC) was administered one day after WBRT initiation, and atezolizumab was administered seven days after WBRT completion.

At 4.9 months after WBRT initiation, the large cerebellar lesion remarkably decreased in size, along with significant attenuation of the enhancing effect, and the two adjacent lesions regressed completely. Before WBRT initiation, nine out of the 15 lesions were visible as solid enhancing masses. The right cerebellar lesion regressed markedly. At 4.9 months after WBRT initiation, all nine lesions regressed.
