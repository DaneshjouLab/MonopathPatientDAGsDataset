A patient presented with left abdominal pain for one month. Diagnostic imaging with PET-CT revealed soft tissue lesions in the left upper lobe of the lung with increased FDG metabolism, suggesting possible lung cancer. An enlarged left hilar lymph node was also noted. Soft tissue density shadows in bilateral adrenal glands and the left kidney posteromedial were considered as metastases. The patient was diagnosed with pulmonary enteric adenocarcinoma (PEAC). PEAC pathological features showed enteric origin or enteric morphology similar to lung metastatic colorectal cancer (lmCRC). Diagnostic criteria included colorectal morphologic cells exceeding 50% of the tumor tissue and positive for at least one colorectal immunophenotype, including CDX-2, CK20, SATB2, and MUC2, Villin, clinically excluding colorectal cancer.

To further evaluate the lung lesion, a CT-guided biopsy of the left lung lesion was performed. Pathology results suggested adenocarcinoma with poor expression of pulmonary markers. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed: TTF-1 (-), CK7 (+), Napsin A (-), CEA (+), CK5/6 (+), Syn (-), P63 (-), Ki-67+ (50%). Genetic test results revealed a KRAS mutation abundance of 31.22%. No EGFR, AKL, ROS-1, MET, or HER-2 mutations were found. PD-L1 expression status was unknown.

Based on these findings, the patient was determined to be at clinical stage IV. Treatment was initiated with the first cycle of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) plus platinum-based chemotherapy: Tislelizumab 200mg d1 + pemetrexed 500mg/m2 d1 + cisplatin 75mg/m2 d2, every 3 weeks.
