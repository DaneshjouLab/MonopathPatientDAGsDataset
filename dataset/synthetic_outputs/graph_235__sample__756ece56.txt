A 64-year-old man presented with cough and chest X-ray findings showing right pleural effusion and a right hilar mass. Significant facial edema was observed. Chest CT showed superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. A transbronchial biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) histologically. Histological findings of the transbronchial biopsy of the tumor showed small-cell lung cancer. H&E x400, CD56\u00d7400, chromogranin A x400, synaptophysin x100. A whole-body search indicated right hilar, mediastinal, right supraclavicular, aortic, and superior mediastinal lymph node metastasis and pleural effusion. Enhanced brain MRI revealed no brain metastases. No abnormal findings were found in the abdomen. The patient was diagnosed with extensive SCLC. The patient started on first-line treatment with carboplatin (area under the curve [AUC] 6\u2009mg\u00b7mL\u207b\u00b9\u00b7min\u207b\u00b9) and etoposide (100\u2009mg\u00b7m\u207b\u00b2). Right pneumothorax was observed on day 4, and chest tube drainage was initiated. Empirical administration of ampicillin/sulbactam was started on day 6 due to fever and right thoracic empyema.
