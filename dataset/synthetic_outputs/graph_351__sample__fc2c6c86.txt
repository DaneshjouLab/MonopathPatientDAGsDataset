A 70-year-old woman taking oral steroids with tapering after an acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) was diagnosed with stage IIIB squamous cell lung cancer by transbronchial lung biopsy from the left hilum 6 months before admission. She declined chemotherapy due to anorexia and started tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil.

Thirty-six days after starting tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil, she presented with a 5-day history of chest pain, exacerbation of cough, and severe palpitations. Her blood pressure was 120/67 mm Hg, and her heart rate was 88 bpm.

Chest CT revealed known lung cancer on the left hilum, abutting the pericardium, which had invaded the mediastinum, causing pneumopericardium and pneumomediastinum.

Physical examination revealed jugular vein distention (JVD) in the sitting position and muffled heart sounds. Echocardiography showed no reduction in ejection fraction, although the pneumopericardium prevented detailed observation. Chest CT scan shows squamous cell lung cancer on the left hilum that invades the mediastinum, pneumomediastinum and pneumopericardium with an anterior extent, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).

Fluoroscopy-guided urgent pericardiocentesis was performed through the superior margin of the left fifth rib, and air was aspirated. JVD, dyspnoea, and chest pain improved.

Follow-up CT the next day and the fourth day after admission showed the pneumopericardium was shrinking.

The patient was discharged on the fifth day since most of the air from the pneumopericardium had been absorbed.

A CT scan 3 days after pericardiocentesis showed pneumomediastinum shrinkage and no recognisable pneumopericardium.
