A 51-year-old male presented with mild hemoptysis and chest pain. Due to these symptoms, the patient underwent a CT scan, which revealed a 3.4-cm mass in the right middle lobe. Further lab testing was performed to investigate the mass, and neuron-specific enolase was found to be elevated at 20.55 ng/ml. Percutaneous transthoracic needle biopsy was performed due to the elevated neuron-specific enolase. The biopsy revealed organoid nesting and peripheral palisading patterns, with moderate to abundant cytoplasm and prominent nucleoli. Immunohistochemistry and FISH were performed on the biopsy sample, showing positive staining for TTF-1, CgA and Syn, and revealing ALK gene translocation. Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with LCNEC. Further radiographic examinations were performed after diagnosis of LCNEC with ALK gene translocation to assess for metastasis, which showed both bone and brain metastasis. The patient then underwent two cycles of chemotherapy consisting of etoposide and cisplatin. After stable disease was achieved, chemotherapy with etoposide and cisplatin was discontinued and the patient was switched to crizotinib. A CT scan was performed after the patient was switched to crizotinib, which showed a 3.1 cm tumor in the middle lobe of the lung.
