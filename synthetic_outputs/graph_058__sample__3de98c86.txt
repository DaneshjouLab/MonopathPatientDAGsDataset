A 65-year-old man was referred to the hospital with suspected uveitis of the right eye, experiencing right ocular pain and blurred vision for one month. Four months prior to this presentation, he had been diagnosed with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) (cT4N3M1c) with right cerebellar metastasis and invasion. Following the SCLC diagnosis, the patient was started on topical 0.005% latanoprost, 1.0% brinzolamide, 0.5% timolol maleate, and oral acetazolamide at a dose of 500 mg/day. Due to high intraocular pressure (IOP) and pronounced nausea, the patient required intravenous administration of 200 mL of 20% hypertonic mannitol every 2-3 days, for a total of five administrations. Ten days after the initial visit, anterior chamber fluid cytology revealed iris metastasis from SCLC, consistent with bronchoalveolar lavage cytology results. To treat the neovascular glaucoma, the patient received a single intravitreal injection of 2 mg (0.05 mL of 40 mg/mL) aflibercept in the right eye, also 10 days after the initial visit. Five days post-aflibercept injection, the iris tumor size and iris neovascularization decreased, and IOP measured at 18 mm Hg. Antiglaucoma medications were continued to maintain IOP. Intravenous hypertonic mannitol was no longer required, and the patient experienced relief from ocular pain and nausea.
