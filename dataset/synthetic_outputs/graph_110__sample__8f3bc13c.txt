A 64-year-old male presented in April 2022 with blood-tinged sputum of unknown etiology, estimated volume approximately 5 ml. In May 2022, the patient experienced a recurring episode of hemoptysis with similar characteristics and volume, prompting a chest CT scan at Xingyi People's Hospital (Xingyi, China). The imaging examination identified a lesion in the posterior segment of the right lower lobe, accompanied by slight bronchial dilation and distal infection, measuring approximately 2.8 x 3.2 cm.

The patient was administered antitussive (10 mg codeine, taken orally twice daily), hemostatic (10 units posterior pituitary hormone dissolved in 250 ml 10% glucose solution for intravenous infusion) and anti-infective therapies (1.5 g cefuroxime sodium in 100 ml 0.9% sodium chloride solution administered via intravenous infusion, once every 8 h), but the patient's clinical status did not demonstrate any notable improvement.

Five days prior to admission to the Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, axial and coronal CT scans of the chest showed a mass in the right lower lung. One day post-admission, axial and coronal CT scans of the chest showed a right lower lung patch with cavitation. Lung cancer was suspected, and infectious lesions complicated with abscess formation could not be ruled out.

Six days after the recurrence of hemoptysis, the patient was transferred to the Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University for further evaluation. The patient had a smoking history of over 40 years, consuming approximately 15 cigarettes daily, and had abstained from smoking for 1 week. Physical examination revealed diminished breath sounds on the right side. Blood cell evaluations showed elevated inflammatory markers, including white blood cells, absolute neutrophils, and neutrophil percentage.

Post-admission, coagulation parameters, pulmonary function tests, whole-body bone scintigraphy, and cranial CT findings all exhibited normal results. A chest CT scan exhibited patchy opacities in the right lower lobe with the presence of a cavity, measuring approximately 5.7 x 4.5 cm. The lesion was suspected to be indicative of lung cancer.

Two days post-admission, the patient developed a high fever, with a maximum temperature reaching 39.2Â°C.

Post-admission, empirical antibiotic therapy with cefuroxime sodium was initiated (1.5 g cefuroxime sodium in 100 ml 0.9% sodium chloride solution administered via intravenous infusion, once every 8 h).

On day 3 post-admission, the antibiotic treatment was switched to piperacillin (4.5 g piperacillin sodium in 100 ml 0.9% sodium chloride solution administered via intravenous infusion, once every 8 h) due to persistent fever.
