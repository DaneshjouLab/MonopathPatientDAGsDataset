A 75-year-old woman with a medical history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, thalassemia trait, osteoarthritis of the knees, and hyperthyroidism presented with bloating, abdominal discomfort, and a change in stool caliber that had been occurring for a couple of weeks. She denied any association with fatty diet, alcohol consumption, or dairy intake. She reported no respiratory symptoms, appetite loss, or cachexia and was a lifelong non-smoker. Physical examination was unremarkable, with normal breath sounds, a soft, non-tender abdomen, and no lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, abdominal mass, or stigmata of chronic liver disease. Her medications included calcium carbonate, calciferol, and atenolol.

Due to her age, presentation, and change in stool caliber, she underwent colonoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). Colonoscopy revealed multiple hyperplastic polyps, which were removed. EGD revealed 2 F2 varices and 1 F1 varix in the midesophagus (30-35 cm from the incisors), not extending to the esophagogastric junction. Below the varices, benign squamous papillomata and a venous bleb were noted. No gastric varices were seen. The varices were identified as downhill esophageal varices (DEVs) based on their vertical longitudinal appearance and location.

To investigate the cause of the DEVs, chest x-ray and computed tomography (CT) of the chest and neck were performed. The chest x-ray showed a subtle reticular-ground glass opacity in the right upper zone. CT revealed a 2.7-cm pulmonary nodule located peripherally in the right upper lung, adjacent to the pleura, and far superolateral to the superior vena cava (SVC) without SVC contact or obstruction. Subcentimeter lymph nodes with internal microcalcification were noted at the left cervical IIb level. No thyroid nodules or liver cirrhosis were found.

A lung biopsy was performed, confirming the lesion to be an adenocarcinoma. The patient subsequently underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery with right upper lobe lobectomy and lymph node biopsy. Pathological examination of the surgical specimen revealed a lepidic-predominant invasive adenocarcinoma, with a total size of 2.7 cm and an invasive tumor size of 1.1 cm.
