# Malignant Peritoneal Mesothelioma Presenting as a Mass in a Spigelian Hernia: Report of a Case

Cancers that occur within the abdomen and pelvis may present within a hernia. This case report describes a patient who presented with a large (11 cm greatest diameter) mass in the left lower quadrant. The mass was located within a Spigelian hernia belt and was composed of malignant peritoneal mesothelioma. At the time of cytoreductive surgery, numerous other sites of malignant peritoneal mesothelioma were present within the abdomen and pelvis.

The patient's left lower quadrant mass was a malignant peritoneal mesothelioma presenting within a Spigelian hernia defect. This phenomenon has not been previously reported. Cancer presenting within a Spigelian hernia has also not been previously reported.

Gastrointestinal cancer, gynecologic cancer, and malignant peritoneal mesothelioma may disseminate widely to the surfaces of the abdomen and pelvis. In some patients, this spread of the disease may find its way into a hernia sac. When cancer disseminates within the abdominal and pelvic space as peritoneal metastases, it does so by a definite pattern that is characteristic of a particular cancer diagnosis. Hernia defects of the parietal peritoneal lining of the abdomen and pelvis are sites for cancer cells to be trapped and then progress. Peritoneal mesothelioma progressed rapidly within a hernia sac.
