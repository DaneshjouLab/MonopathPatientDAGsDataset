A 62-year-old patient with a history of deep vein thrombosis, hypertension, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and smoking (20 pack-years, quit 20 years ago) was admitted to the hospital after being diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma following a supraclavicular lymph node biopsy.

On admission, the patient's performance status was 1 on the ECOG scale. He complained of dyspnea on exertion and a dry cough for two months. He had lost 4 kg of weight in six months. Auscultation revealed basilar crackles on the left side. A diagnostic workup of predictive biomarkers was ordered on the patient's histopathological specimens.

A diagnosis of adenocarcinoma was confirmed (CKAE/AE3+, CK7+, TTF-1+). DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue and tested for *EGFR* variants using the cobas *EGFR* mutation test v2 assay. Immunohistochemistry for *ALK* protein expression was performed using VENTANA ALK (CloneD5F3). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was carried out using the ZytoLight FISH-Tissue Implementation Kit and Spec *ROS1* Dual Color Break Apart Probe. No clinically relevant variants were found in any of these tests. PD-L1 was assessed using Ventana antibody, revealing expression on 20% of tumor cells (TPS).

Thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic CT with contrast, performed according to RECIST 1.1 criteria, revealed the following target lesions: a 46 mm tumor in the left hilum, 47 mm right hilar lymph nodes, and a 17 mm celiac lymph node, with a sum of length diameter (SLD) of 110 mm. Nontarget lesions included enlarged subcarinal lymph nodes; upper and lower paratracheal lymph nodes; multiple nodules in both lungs; and radiological features of lymph vessels invasion, namely ground glass opacities, septal thickening, and small nodules with perilymphatic distribution. Moreover, a subsegmental pulmonary embolism was revealed. The patient was started on an anticoagulant. A cranial CT revealed no abnormalities.

The disease clinical stage was initially classified as IVA (cT2bN3M1a) by the 8th Edition of TNM UICC. He commenced immunochemotherapy with a regimen of 4 induction courses of cisplatin, pemetrexed, pembrolizumab, and a continuation with pembrolizumab and subsequently pemetrexed.
