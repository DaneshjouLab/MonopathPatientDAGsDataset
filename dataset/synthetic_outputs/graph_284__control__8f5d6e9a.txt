A 31-year-old Asian woman, a lifelong nonsmoker, presented for evaluation of an incidentally found left lung nodule. She had recently experienced mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and influenza, resulting in a prolonged cough lasting over 6 weeks. Her primary care physician ordered a chest X-ray followed by a CT scan to evaluate the cough, which revealed a 2.7-cm well-circumscribed nodule in the lingula abutting the major fissure. On evaluation, the patient was asymptomatic except for the cough. She denied weight loss, hemoptysis, or shortness of breath. A PET scan was performed for further evaluation of the lung nodule, showing FDG uptake in the mass. There was no associated FDG-avid hilar or mediastinal adenopathy.
