This case report describes a patient with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who developed leptomeningeal metastasis (LM), a condition associated with poor prognosis. The patient was diagnosed with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma and found to have an EGFR mutation. Initial diagnosis involved a chest computed tomography and biopsy, with EGFR mutation analysis performed using amplification refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction.

The patient initially responded to erlotinib monotherapy. However, the disease progressed, and the patient subsequently developed extensive LM. Magnetic resonance images of the brain confirmed extensive LM. Exfoliated tumor cells were identified in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained via lumbar puncture and cytology examination. CSF circulating tumor DNA analysis using next-generation sequencing (NGS) revealed EGFR mutations, specifically exon19 E746_T751delinsI and exon20 C797S. This indicated the presence of EGFR C797S, a resistance mutation to osimertinib, in addition to a sensitive EGFR mutation. The patient was then treated with erlotinib combined with pemetrexed, cis-platinum, and bevacizumab. The patient's NSCLC eventually became osimertinib resistant with LM. The CSF NGS revealed EGFR SM/C797S/T790M triple mutations. The patient also developed optic nerve invasion.
