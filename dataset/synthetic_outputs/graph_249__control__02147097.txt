A 65-year-old man presented with right forearm pain and paralysis of his right-hand fingers. Physical examination revealed right forearm swelling and drop finger with no sensory deficits in the fingers. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a forearm mass, while chest x-ray and computed tomography identified a right upper lobe mass and right renal tumour. All masses were histologically identified as non-small cell lung cancer. Consequently, posterior interosseous nerve (PIN) palsy secondary to lung cancer metastasis was diagnosed. The patient tested positive for MET exon 14 skipping mutation. Palliative radiation therapy (30 Gy in 10 fractions) was administered to the forearm tumour, followed by systemic tepotinib therapy. The drop finger showed no improvement despite tumour size reduction. Skeletal muscle metastasis of lung cancer is rare, but clinicians should be aware that tumour-induced nerve compression symptoms may develop.
