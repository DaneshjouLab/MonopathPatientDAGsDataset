An 11-year-old, castrated male Toy Poodle, weighing 7.4 kg, presented with a right inguinal hernia and a skin lesion. Physical examination revealed abdominal distension, right inguinal hernia, and epidermal collarette on the entire dorsal skin. The dog also showed Cushing body shape, polydipsia, and polyuria. A Grade II/VI systolic murmur was heard from the left ventricle. Cushingâ€™s syndrome was suspected. The skin lesion was preliminarily diagnosed as simple pyoderma. Abdominal echography and an epidermal curettage test were performed. Serum cortisol levels were measured.
