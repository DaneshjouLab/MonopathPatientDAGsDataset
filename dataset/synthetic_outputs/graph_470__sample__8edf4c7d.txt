A 65-year-old man with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma (bilateral lung metastases) diagnosed in February 2020, and a former smoker with a 15 pack-year history, received a vaccination for seasonal influenza. He started treatment with carboplatin, pemetrexed, and pembrolizumab on March 6, 2020.

On March 13, 2020, the patient presented to the outpatient clinic reporting fever in the previous 24 hours and a productive cough. Physical examination revealed tachycardia (100 bpm), a temperature of 40Â°C, and fine crackles at the right lung base. His arterial oxygen partial pressure/fractional inspired oxygen (P/F) ratio in room air was 328.

Blood tests showed grade 3 leukopenia and neutropenia and elevation of C-reactive protein (CRP). A chest radiograph did not demonstrate any signs of interstitial pneumonia. A nasopharyngeal swab for COVID-19 was performed.

The patient was hospitalized, and treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factors and broad-spectrum empirical antibiotics was started.

Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing for COVID-19 nucleic acid was positive on day 2 (24 hours after admission). CRP had increased to 225 mg/L, and his IL-6 level was 101 ng/L. Blood cultures and legionella and pneumococcal urinary antigen tests were negative. The patient was prescribed Darunavir 800 mg/d, ritonavir 100 mg/d, and hydroxychloroquine 200 mg twice daily. Oxygen supplementation with a reservoir mask at 15 L/min was administered.

On day 7, the patient's P/F ratio decreased to 58. A CT scan showed areas of consolidation in the right and left lower lobes, with diffuse ground glass opacities and inter- and intralobular septal thickening ("crazy paving").

On days 8 and 9, the patient was given the first and second dose of tocilizumab (8 mg/kg weight every 12 hours).

The P/F ratio increased to 100 the morning after the first dose of tocilizumab.

The CRP level decreased from 212 mg/dL to 37 mg/dL by 48 hours after the second dose of tocilizumab. The WBC count on day 1 was 1.61 \u00d7103/mm3.
