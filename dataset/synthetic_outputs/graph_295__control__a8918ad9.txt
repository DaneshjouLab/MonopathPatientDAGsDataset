A patient with a medical history including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease, heart failure, anxiety, depression, and prior non-Hodgkinâ€™s lymphoma treated with CHOP, radiation therapy, and stem cell rescue, resulting in long-term remission, presented with a new lung issue. A CT-guided biopsy confirmed adenocarcinoma, leading to a right middle lobectomy and lymph node dissection. The pathologic report revealed a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma (ADC) without lymph node or pleural involvement, staged as a pathologic T1b lesion, consistent with stage I lung cancer.

After a lobectomy for right middle lobe adenocarcinoma (ADC), the patient was diagnosed with synchronous small cell carcinoma (SCLC) in the right upper lobe and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in the right lower lobe. Pathology confirmed a poorly-differentiated small cell carcinoma (SCLC) in the RUL, as well as a moderately-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in the RLL lesion with metastasis to the right hilar lymph node. Her two new tumors were consistent with limited stage small cell carcinoma in RUL and stage II (T2, N1, M0) squamous cell carcinoma in RLL.

Given the complexities and her high surgical risk, a multidisciplinary tumor board recommended a combined treatment approach with radiation therapy and chemotherapy. However, during the simulation session for radiation therapy, new bilateral lung nodules were discovered, raising concerns about extensive stage malignancy from the small cell carcinoma. Consequently, immunotherapy with atezolizumab was integrated into her chemotherapy regimen of carboplatin and etoposide.
