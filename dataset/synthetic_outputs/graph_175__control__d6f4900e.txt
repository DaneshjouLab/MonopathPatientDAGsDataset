In December 2015, a 57-year-old male presenting with chest pain and post-activity fatigue was diagnosed with left lower lung adenocarcinoma (cT1N2M1a stage IVA) upon identification of cancer cells in his left pleural effusion. The NGS of the paraffin-embedded section from pleural effusion revealed an ALK-positive mutation (EML4-ALK fusion). Consequently, the patient began self-administering crizotinib from 30th December 2015, at a dose of 250 mg twice daily. An initial complete response (CR) was observed by 1th January 2016 and bi-monthly follow-ups showed no drug related adverse effects including rash or hypertension. The patient exhibited a PFS1 of 35 months. On 16th November 2018, the patient underwent chest ultrasound scan for post-activity fatigue, which indicated massive left pleural effusion. The subsequent pleural effusion cytological examination found cancer cells. The efficacy assessment for the patient was progression disease (PD). Nevertheless, DNA sequencing of paraffin-embedded section from pleural effusion revealed the ALK point mutation (F1174C exon23) on Illumina high-throughput sequencing platform. The patient was then switched from crizotinib to alectinib at a dose of 600 mg twice daily since 4th December 2018.
