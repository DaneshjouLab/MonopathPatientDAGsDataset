In August 2015, a 61-year-old White female presented with a 12-lb weight loss in the past 3 months. Her social history included a 40-pack-year smoking history, and her family history was positive for lung cancer. A lung cancer screening CT showed a 3.2 cm Ã— 4.1 cm posterior left upper lobe (LUL) pulmonary mass with extension to the pleural margin as well as a 7 mm right middle lobe (RML) nodule. Diagnostic bronchoscopy with LUL and RML video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) wedge resection and left and right mediastinal lymph node dissection was conducted. VATS LUL completion lobectomy was subsequently performed. Histologic examination revealed Stage IB LUL adenocarcinoma and Stage IA RML squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Follow-up CTs indicated changes consistent with expected postsurgical findings. No new pathologically enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes or evidence of metastasis in the chest, abdomen, or pelvis were detected. Later follow-up CT scan demonstrated an interval increase in the size of the subcarinal lymph node and right lymph node conglomerate encasing the RUL pulmonary artery concerning for local metastasis. The patient presented with dyspnea and cough secondary to COPD but denied worsening shortness of breath and hemoptysis. Physical examination revealed scattered rhonchi and expiratory wheezing bilaterally without rales or labored respiration. The patient continued to smoke daily.
