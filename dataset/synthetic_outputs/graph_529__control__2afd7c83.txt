We present the case of a 70-year-old female patient with right upper quadrant (RUQ) abdominal pain, nausea, malaise, and unintentional weight loss secondary to biphasic peritoneal mesothelioma (BPM). A 70-year-old female presented to the emergency room complaining of RUQ abdominal pain, nausea, and malaise for several days. She also reported significant weight loss for a couple of months. As a part of her diagnostic workup, computed tomography (CT) abdomen showed a large mass in the region of the hepatic flexure and ascending colon, which was contiguous to a 5-centimeter (cm) mass in the lower portion of segment VI of the liver. Following a high leukocytosis of 23.8, an infra-hepatic fluid collection was identified on a CT scan on POD 11. Subsequently, CT-guided drainage was performed, and 15 ccs of bilious fluid were aspirated upon placement of the catheter. On POD 14, her leukocytosis had normalized to 10.1. Following an increase in oral intake, she was cleared for discharge on POD 15. The patient died several weeks later, likely related to the highly aggressive nature of the disease.
