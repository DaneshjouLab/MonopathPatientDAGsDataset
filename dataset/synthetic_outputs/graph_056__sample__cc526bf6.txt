The patient's cancer had no driver gene mutations. Consequently, first-line chemotherapy with cisplatin, pemetrexed, and pembrolizumab was administered. Due to disease progression, the patient was then treated with second-line chemotherapy consisting of docetaxel and ramucirumab. Chemotherapy was subsequently delayed for approximately one month because the patient developed a perianal abscess, which required surgical intervention under local anesthesia. The day following surgery, the patient developed dyspnea. Four days after symptom onset, the patient was admitted to the hospital. At the time of admission, the patient was alert, afebrile (36.3 \u00b0C), slightly hypotensive with reduced pulse pressure (blood pressure 106/86 mmHg), and hypoxemic (oxygen saturation 85% on room air). Tachycardia (101 beats per minute) was present. No adventitious heart or lung sounds were noted. Laboratory findings revealed elevated D-dimer (6 \u03bcg/mL), C-reactive protein (1.96 mg/dL), brain natriuretic peptide (285 pg/mL), and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels (47.8 ng/mL). Complete blood count showed WBC 6800/\u03bcL, Neutrophils 73.70%, Eosinophils 5.10%, Basophils 1%, Monocytes 14%, Lymphocytes 4.20%, RBC 366 \u00d7 104/\u03bcL, Hemoglobin 11.2 g/dL, Hematocrit 34.30%, Platelets 13.2 \u00d7 104/\u03bcL. Arterial blood gas (room air) showed: pH 7.431, pCO2 35.6 mmHg, pO2 68.8 mmHg, HCO3- 23.2 mEq/L. Other lab values included: Total protein 5.7 g/dL, Albumin 3.4 g/dL, AST 14 IU/L, ALT 14 IU/L, LDH 393 IU/L, ALP 86 IU/L, Total bilirubin 0.6 mg/dL, BUN 19.5 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.08 mg/dL, Sodium 141 mEq/L, Potassium 3.7 mEq/L, Chloride 111 mEq/L. Coagulation status was PT-INR 0.95, APTT 30.4 sec.
