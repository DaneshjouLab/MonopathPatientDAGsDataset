A 63-year-old Caucasian athletic immunocompetent female with a history of well-controlled essential hypertension and hypothyroidism presented with 2 months of progressive shortness of breath, fatigue, loss of appetite, and a 15-pound weight loss. One week prior to admission, she underwent a primary care evaluation with a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) which revealed diffuse nodular opacities throughout the lungs bilaterally with areas of coalescence and no lymphovascular invasion.

On admission, her vitals included a temperature of 37.6 Â°C (99.6 Fahrenheit), blood pressure of 138/92 mmHg, heart rate of 116, and respiratory rate of 39. The differential diagnosis included infectious versus inflammatory processes, interstitial lung disease, or lymphangitic carcinomatosis. She was considered high risk for fungal and atypical mycobacterial infections due to living in the mid-west and a thin body habitus.

Contrast computed tomography angiogram and positron emission tomography revealed diffuse hypermetabolic interstitial and airspace abnormalities of the lungs without lymphadenopathy or distant involvement, in addition to right hydropneumothorax and left pleural effusion. Baseline laboratory testing was unremarkable, and extensive bacterial and fungal testing returned negative.

Bronchoscopy and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery were subsequently performed. Pleural fluid cytology, lung, and pleural biopsies returned positive for lepidic adenocarcinoma with 2% programmed death ligand 1 expression and genomic testing positive for PTEN gene deletion.

Prior to treatment, the patient perished on day 15 of admission. This case represents a rare presentation of lepidic predominant adenocarcinoma with extensive bilateral aerogenous spread in the context of no lymphovascular invasion in a healthy, low-risk patient.
