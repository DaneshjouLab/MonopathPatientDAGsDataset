Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a rare and highly aggressive tumor. MPM is mostly associated with exposure to asbestos, and the incidence of MPM is increasing in many countries because of the long latency period between the exposure to asbestos and occurrence of the disease. Patients with MPM are often diagnosed at advanced stage and are treated with pemetrexed (PEM) plus cisplatin, which are the currently approved first-line therapy. Nivolumab showed durable antitumor effect in patients with recurrent MPM and was approved for those patients in Japan in 2018. Immune related adverse event (irAE) is occurred in various organs and is suggestive to be related to better outcome of nivolumab. Frequency of hematological irAE is low and there are few reports about hematological irAE and association between irAE and outcome of nivolumab in patients with MPM.

This report presents a case of recurrent MPM who responded to nivolumab treatment and experienced nivolumab-induced immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). A clinical response to nivolumab was observed in this patient. However, the patient developed nivolumab-induced immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Although high dose dexamethasone was administered and platelet count increased transiently, re-administration of dexamethasone was required to maintain normal count of platelet. Careful and intensive management of ITP treatment is necessary in patients who show no response or who relapse after initial glucocorticoid treatment. This patient needed repeated administration of dexamethasone for nivolumab-induced immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) treatment. This is the first report of nivolumab-induced ITP and its association with response to nivolumab treatment in a patient with MPM. The careful and intensive management of ITP treatment is necessary in cases who show no response or relapse to initial glucocorticoids treatment.
