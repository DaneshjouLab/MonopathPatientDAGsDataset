A patient with lung cancer combined with idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs) experienced an acute exacerbation of IIPs (AE-IIPs). Eighteen days after undergoing bronchoscopy for lung cancer evaluation, the patient underwent fluorine-18 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (<sup>18</sup>F-FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). The scan revealed AE-IIPs before the onset of respiratory failure. New ground-glass opacities were observed, accompanied by significant <sup>18</sup>F-FDG accumulation extending beyond these regions. The patient had higher preoperative <sup>18</sup>F‚ÄêFDG accumulation in lung interstitial lesions.
