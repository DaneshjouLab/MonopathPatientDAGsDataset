A 48-year-old male presented to the Emergency Room with a 3-day history of worsening widespread joint pain and swelling, resulting in total debility and being bedbound. The joint swelling and pain started suddenly and was generalized to all four limbs, with the left knee being particularly painful and swollen. The patient also reported anorexia, nausea, and a lack of energy for about 2 weeks.

The patient had a past surgical history of ORIF left tibia with nail placement following a traumatic tibial fracture. His social history included daily marijuana use, a 1 pack per day smoking habit for 30 years, no alcohol or drug use, and unemployment. On physical exam, his vitals were: BP 116/65, T 98.5 degrees Fahrenheit, RR 16, SPO2 100% on room air. Extremities showed moderate dactylitis of all fingers and toes, pain to palpation of hands and feet, left knee pain with restricted movement, pain and swelling over the left ankle, and widespread finger clubbing.

The patient was found to have microcytic anemia (new from 1 year prior). A chest X-ray revealed a large oval mass in the right upper lobe, which may represent a bulla or soft tissue mass. He was admitted to the general medical floor and worked up for arthritis, with differential diagnoses including rheumatoid arthritis, seronegative spondyloarthropathy, disseminated gonococcal infection, or septic arthritis. He was started on scheduled NSAIDs and oral glucocorticoids for symptomatic treatment of arthritis.

Further investigation with a follow-up CT scan revealed severe emphysema and a 6.5 cm x 8.7 cm x 5.8 cm mass in the right upper lobe. A comprehensive metabolic panel was performed.

Urinalysis was performed. An acute hepatitis panel and HIV screen were both negative. The sedimentation rate was elevated at 125 mm/HR (reference 0â€“15).

Additional labs showed a C-reactive protein of 261 mg/L (high). The iron profile revealed: Iron 22 mcg/dL (low), TIBC 173 mcg/dL (low), Iron Saturation 13% (low), and Ferritin 1330 ng/mL (high). The ANA screen and rheumatoid factor were both negative.

Further testing revealed negative Anti-CCP antibodies, negative Gonorrhea and chlamydia PCR, negative HLA B-27, and Parvovirus IgG positive, IgM negative.
