A patient presented with symptoms including cough, dyspnea, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. Physical examination revealed dullness at percussion and diminished breath sounds. Imaging showed an opaque left hemithorax with ipsilateral attraction of the mediastinum, suggesting a large cystic mass. Further investigation revealed an endobronchial mass.

The patient was diagnosed with a malignancy, initially suspected to be lung cancer. Differential diagnoses included adenoid cystic carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and carcinoid tumor. The patient underwent surgery, radiation therapy, and palliative chemotherapy.

Despite treatment, the patient experienced recurrence and relapse of the tumor, indicating metastasis. The patient's condition continued to deteriorate.
