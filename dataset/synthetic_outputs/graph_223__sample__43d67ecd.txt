A 54-year-old male with a history of right clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) pT1a, resected in January 2014, presented for surveillance imaging, which revealed two suspect osteolytic lesions localized in the L1 and L2 vertebrae. Further investigation via bone biopsy confirmed the presence of carcinoma cells compatible with ccRCC in L1 and L2 vertebrae, indicating metastasis. Assessment of the patient's overall condition and disease progression resulted in a prognostic Motzer risk score of intermediate.

Treatment was initiated with antalgic radiation therapy to L1 and L2 for a total dose of 36 Gy, followed by first-line sunitinib 50 mg per day (4-weeks-on/2-weeks-off schedule) and zoledronic acid. Due to Grade 2 asthenia and Grade 2 hand-foot syndrome, the sunitinib schedule was adjusted to 2-weeks-on/1-week-off, with better tolerability.

The patient subsequently developed subclinical hypothyroidism, but L-thyroxine replacement therapy was not initiated. Further investigation of the thyroid via neck ultrasound showed a thyroid gland of normal volume, without nodules or parenchymal abnormalities. The sunitinib dose was then reduced to 37.5 mg per day due to worsening hand-foot syndrome. TSH normalized without therapy after reduction of the sunitinib dose.

Follow-up neck US showed a thyroid micronodule (4 x 4 x 5 mm, vol 0.042 mL) solid in nature, strongly hypoechoic, with taller-than-wide shape, ill-defined margins, and little peripheral vascularity on Doppler US. Spine MRI showed a suspect metastatic bone lesion in C4 vertebra. The patient continued sunitinib 37.5 mg per day due to stability of the bone lesions at periodic CT and MRI scans.
