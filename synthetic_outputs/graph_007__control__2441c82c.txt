Herein, we report a case of lung adenocarcinoma in a 58-year-old Chinese male patient who presented to our hospital on April 20, 2020, for a physical examination. The patient was asymptomatic, with no cough, sputum, hemoptysis, chest pain, or dyspnea. He had no history of diabetes, hypertension, or family history of cancer. The patient had a smoking history of over 7 years, averaging 20–40 cigarettes per day, but had abstained from smoking for nearly 30 years. Chest contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed a mass measuring approximately 4.0 cm × 3.4 cm in the inferior lobe of the right lung, along with swollen and fused lymph nodes in the hilum and mediastinum. A CT-guided lung biopsy was performed, and the pathological examination confirmed lung adenocarcinoma. This case is notable for the rare coexistence of a novel ALK double fusion, namely, ELMOD3-ALK and EML4-ALK, in a patient with lung adenocarcinoma who demonstrated favorable sensitivity to alectinib. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements account for approximately 3%–5% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 gene (EML4) and ALK fusion (EML4-ALK) is the most common ALK rearrangement in NSCLC patients. This is the first report of one lung adenocarcinoma patient with a novel ELMOD3-ALK, EML4-ALK double-ALK fusion.
