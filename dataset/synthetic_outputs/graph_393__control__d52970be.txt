**Title:** Different efficacy in the non-small cell lung cancer patient with bilateral synchronous lesions treated with neoadjuvant gefitinib therapy: a case report

**Case Report:**

Gefitinib, the first-generation epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI), has become the standard of care for the first-line of therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with common EGFR mutation. However, the efficacy of preoperative gefitinib therapy in patients with common EGFR mutations remains poorly defined. We describe a NSCLC patient with bilateral synchronous lesions who had a significantly positive response to gefitinib before radical surgical resection. At the time of initial diagnosis, we were unable to confirm whether the two lesions were metastatic or synchronous primary lesions. Accordingly, we performed CT-guided percutaneous left lung biopsy resulting in a diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma with exon 21 L858R point mutation of EGFR, This diagnosis was followed by preoperative gefitinib therapy for 8 weeks leading to a significant reduction in the lesion in the left lower lobe. Then the left lower lobectomy and mediastinal lymphadenectomy were performed. In addition, 3 months following resection of the left lower lobe tumor the patient underwent a right lower lobe wedge resection. This report indicates that NSCLC patient harboring common EGFR mutation accepting the first-generation EGFR-TKI gefitinib as a neoadjuvant targeted therapy option is safe, feasible, and well-tolerated.
