A 60-year-old man was diagnosed with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), classified as cT3N1M0, stage IIIA. He underwent concurrent chemoradiotherapy, receiving two cycles of cisplatin (60 mg/m2) plus tegafur-gimeracil-oteracil (120 mg/day) in combination with concurrent radiotherapy (60 Gy/30 fr). During chemoradiotherapy, he developed grade 3 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, necessitating a dose reduction in the second chemotherapy cycle. He completed the planned chemoradiotherapy.

Due to sustained thrombocytopenia, maintenance therapy with durvalumab was initially postponed. A coagulation test revealed hyperfibrinolysis. Durvalumab was initiated one month later, after his platelet count recovered to 142 x 10^3/µL. However, thrombocytopenia re-emerged soon after durvalumab initiation, with the platelet count reaching a minimum of 55 x 10^3/µL, despite normal hemoglobin concentration and white cell counts. Durvalumab was discontinued after five cycles because the thrombocytopenia did not improve.

Further investigation revealed an elevated platelet-associated IgG (PA-IgG) level, approximately twice the normal level. A bone marrow examination showed normoplastic marrow with no cancer invasion, blastic proliferation, myelodysplasia, or myelofibrosis. Megakaryocyte depletion was demonstrated, and the bone marrow smear showed nucleated cell counts of 56,000/µL with slight hypoplasia.
