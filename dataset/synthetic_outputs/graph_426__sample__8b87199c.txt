A 65-year-old never-smoker woman (weight 62 kg) presented in July 2009 with persistent severe mid-back pain. On July 6, 2009, a bone scan showed increased 99mTc-labeled methylene diphosphonate uptake at the thoracic 12 level and the third right rib, in addition to hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy (HPOA) of bilateral femurs and tibias, compatible with bone metastases. A chest CT revealed a 6.87 cm lung mass in the right lower lobe, with a daughter nodule in the same lung lobe. Further investigation revealed a right pleural malignant effusion. Lung biopsy showed atypical glands with lepidic and acinar architecture and enlarged and hyperchromatic nuclei, leading to a diagnosis of moderately differentiated pulmonary adenocarcinoma, cT4 N2 M1b Stage IV. EGFR analysis identified the deletion of codon 746â€“750 in exon 19, resulting in the deletion of the amino acids ELREA. From July 20, 2009, to September 21, 2009, the patient received three cycles of full-dose paclitaxel + cisplatin, which were then discontinued due to grade III sensory neuropathy. The 4th cycle of chemotherapy was switched to a regimen of gemcitabine + cisplatin. Follow-up chest CT showed partial remission. In total, the patient received three cycles of paclitaxel + cisplatin and two cycles of gemcitabine + cisplatin.
