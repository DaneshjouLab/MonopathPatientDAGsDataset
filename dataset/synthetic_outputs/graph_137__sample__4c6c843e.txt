A 69-year-old man with a 2.3 pack-year smoking history was diagnosed with right lung cancer of the lower lobe (clinical stage IA, T1bN0M0). The patient underwent right lower lobectomy and lymph node resection. Postoperative pathological diagnosis was invasive adenocarcinoma, papillary predominant (mixed subtype: papillary 55%, acinar 25%, lepidic 20%), and the tumor size was 2.5 × 1.5 cm with pulmonary metastasis; pathological stage was IIIA, T3(pm1)N2M0. The EGFR of the tumor showed exon 19 deletion. The patient received four cycles of cisplatin and pemetrexed as postoperative adjuvant treatment. Follow-up CT/MRI 7 months after surgery revealed multiple pulmonary metastases and brain metastases. The patient underwent stereotactic radiotherapy for brain metastasis. Afatinib was administered at a dose of 40 mg/day. One month after the initiation of afatinib treatment, chest CT revealed marked shrinkage of the metastatic lesions. The patient continued to receive afatinib, despite the presentation of grade 2 diarrhea and rash. 28 months after surgery (21 months after the initiation of afatinib treatment), brain MRI revealed leptomeningeal enhancement and the patient was diagnosed with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LM), which was cytologically proven by a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. Tumor marker levels increased compared to preoperative levels: CEA 3.1 to 23.0 ng/mL, CYFRA 1.6 to 2.8 ng/mL. The patient was asymptomatic with no progression of pulmonary metastasis. Plasma cell free DNA and CSF samples were negative for EGFR T790M. The patient was treated with bevacizumab (15 mg/kg every 3 weeks) and erlotinib (150 mg/day). Follow-up MRI at 2 months showed markedly decreased leptomeningeal enhancement and declined tumor marker levels: CFA 23.0 to 15.2, CYFRA 2.8 to 2.5.
