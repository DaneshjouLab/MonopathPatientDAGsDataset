In February 2022, a 68-year-old non-smoking female patient with a history of essential hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hypothyroidism, was admitted to the Colentina Occupational Medicine Clinic due to dyspnea, asthenia, loss of appetite, weight loss, and pain in the left thoracic area.

In 2019, the patient was admitted to a local hospital for dyspnea on exertion during moderate physical activity. Thoracic CT revealed pleural effusion in the left hemithorax. Biochemical and cytological analysis of the pleural fluid showed a lymphocyte-predominant exudate. The patient was diagnosed with pleurisy of an unspecified etiology and treated with antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medication for 7 days, resulting in resolution of the pleural effusion.

Between 2019 and 2021, the patient's dyspnea progressively worsened, accompanied by chest pain and weight loss.

In September 2021, the patient was admitted to a thoracic surgery department for pleural effusion. Thoracic CT confirmed pleural effusion in the left hemithorax. Thoracentesis and pleural biopsy revealed diffuse malignant mesothelioma with epithelioid elements.

In October 2021, the patient underwent left thoracotomy and decortication of the pleura. Histopathology showed diffuse biphasic mesothelioma (60% sarcomatous, 40% epithelioid elements) with pulmonary invasion. Post-thoracotomy and decortication, histopathology of the pleura revealed diffuse biphasic mesothelioma with specific cellular structures and positive immunohistochemistry for Calretinin, Wilms tumor 1, and D 24-0, supporting the mesothelioma diagnosis. Antibody BAP1 (C-4) showed no loss of nuclear expression, BER-EP4 and Claudin 4 were negative, and D2-40 was positive.
