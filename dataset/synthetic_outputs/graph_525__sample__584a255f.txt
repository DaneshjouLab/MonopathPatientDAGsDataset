A 67-year-old female with a past medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, ethanol abuse, and a 40-pack-year smoking history presented with a one-week history of shortness of breath, generalized weakness, and poor appetite. Initial laboratory findings revealed AST 728 U/L, ALT 315 U/L, leukocytosis of 11 x 109/L, and lactic acidosis of 7.5 U/L. A CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed bulky mediastinal lymphadenopathy, multiple pulmonary nodules, and several hepatic nodules, raising suspicion for metastatic cancer of unknown origin.

A liver biopsy of a metastatic lesion was performed, which showed poorly differentiated carcinoma consistent with small cell carcinoma of lung origin with a Ki-67 proliferative activity of 91-100%.

Subsequently, the patient's condition deteriorated. She became encephalopathic with agonal respirations, requiring intubation and transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU). In the MICU, she developed vasopressor-dependent shock, necessitating norepinephrine and vasopressin to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 65 mmHg. Due to concern for sepsis, bacterial cultures were collected, and the patient was started on empiric antibiotics with vancomycin, cefepime, and piperacillin-tazobactam.

Further laboratory investigations revealed uric acid 13.8 mg/dL, phosphate 7.3 mg/dL, potassium 5.9 mEq/L, lactic acid >24 U/L, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) >10,008 mmol/L, and serum creatinine 2.81 mg/dL with a minimum calcium of 8.5 mg/dL. The patient also developed severe anion gap metabolic acidosis with a pH of 6.99 and low bicarbonate down to 5 mEq/L. These findings were indicative of tumor lysis syndrome and severe metabolic acidosis.
