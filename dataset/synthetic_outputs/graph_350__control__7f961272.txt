A 72-year-old male patient with small-cell lung cancer developed autoimmune limbic encephalitis and diabetes during adjuvant treatment with Durvalumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI). The patient was followed prospectively as part of a treatment study, allowing access to repeated serum samples and cognitive assessments over time. A high titer of GABA<sub>B</sub>R<sub>1</sub> antibodies appeared early, while GAD65 antibodies appeared later with a lower titer in parallel with the development of diabetes. Subsequently, the patient developed clinical signs of encephalitis, verified by EEG and brain MRI, and also had CSF GABA<sub>B</sub>R<sub>1</sub> antibodies. Durvalumab was discontinued, and steroid treatment with subsequent plasmapheresis were initiated, resulting in a reduction of both CSF and serum antibody levels. Clinical signs of encephalitis gradually improved. This case highlights the importance of being aware of possible serious autoimmune adverse reactions, including neurological syndromes such as encephalitis, when treating patients with high risk of para-neoplasia with ICIs.
