A 57-year-old Chinese man with a 60-pack-year smoking history and 30 years of significant alcohol intake (sober for 10 years) was admitted to the respiratory department at a regional hospital due to hemoptysis and cough. He denied chest pain, fever, shiver, and other concomitant symptoms. Physical examination revealed no palpable or enlarged superficial lymph nodes, and clear breathing sounds in both lungs. A CT scan revealed an irregular large soft tissue mass (52.85 mm) in the right hilar region, invading the right main bronchus, causing narrowing and truncation with atelectasis. Histological examination of a transbronchial specimen confirmed squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). No lymph node metastases or distant organ metastases were identified. Based on the 8th Edition Lung Cancer Stage Classification, he was diagnosed with right central lung SCC with right upper lobe atelectasis (stage cT3N0M0, IIB).

The patient received chemotherapy, interventional embolization, and radiotherapy successively. The tumor regressed rapidly within 48 hours of interventional embolization. Furthermore, the tumor decreased by more than 50% in size within 7 days during radiotherapy. Unfortunately, the patient subsequently developed lymph node metastases and remains under treatment.
