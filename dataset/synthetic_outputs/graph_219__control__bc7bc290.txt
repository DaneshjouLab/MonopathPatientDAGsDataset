A 66-year-old female, never smoker, without remarkable past medical history, was admitted to our institution in October 2022 with complaints of shortness of breath. The patient also reported productive cough without fever and chill. After 2 months of indicated treatment, the patient experienced decreased exercise tolerance and blood testing showed grade 2 leukopenia. The patient experienced impressive tumor shrinkage after Pralsetinib treatment, resulting in tumor downstaging. While it is unclear whether adjuvant therapy is needed after pCR, a number of case studies impended disease recurrence after discontinuation of targeted therapy.
