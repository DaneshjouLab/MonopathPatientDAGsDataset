A 36-year-old female was diagnosed with stage IB cutaneous melanoma, histologically grade 2 with no ulceration. The lesion was removed from her back. Lymph node scintigraphy and removal of 4 sentinel lymph nodes showed no lymphatic spread of the disease. She underwent yearly follow-up visits at the dermato-oncologist, which showed no signs of disease relapse or recurrence. At age 41, 5 years after melanoma removal, she presented with worsening eyesight in the right eye and was diagnosed with a pigmented choroidal tumor. She underwent brachytherapy for the pigmented choroidal tumor. Follow-up with the oncologist revealed metastatic disease throughout the body with a metastasis pattern characteristic of primary cutaneous melanoma. Systemic cancer treatment with ipilimumab and nivolumab was initiated. The choroidal tumor and visual function remained stable for 2 years after brachytherapy. At age 41, 5 years after melanoma removal, a PET/CT scan showed no pathological processes. Ultrasound scans of axillary, abdominal, and pelvic areas performed 9 and 11 years after cutaneous lesion removal were unremarkable.
