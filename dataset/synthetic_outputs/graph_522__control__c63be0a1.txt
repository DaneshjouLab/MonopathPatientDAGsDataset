A patient with cancer, specifically thoracic SMARCA4-deficient undifferentiated lung carcinoma with metastasis, developed Pembrolizumab-Induced Hypophysitis. The patient's initial presentation included symptoms of fatigue and rash.

Following treatment with Pembrolizumab, the patient developed a constellation of symptoms indicative of thyroid dysfunction, insulin-deficient diabetes mellitus, and primary adrenal insufficiency. These symptoms included fatigue, cold intolerance, constipation, dry skin, weight gain, poor libido, erectile dysfunction, hot flashes, diaphoresis, flushing, headaches, visual impairment, and diplopia. Further investigation revealed the patient was experiencing lightheadedness, changes in appetite, polyuria, polydipsia, nocturia, and dry mouth.

The patient was diagnosed with central hypothyroidism and central hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, both resulting from hypophysitis. The hypophysitis was determined to be Pembrolizumab-induced. The patient also experienced headache and fatigue. Ultimately, the patient was diagnosed with central adrenal insufficiency.
