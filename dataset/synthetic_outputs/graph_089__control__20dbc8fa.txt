A 70-year-old man with advanced lung adenocarcinoma presented with high-grade hyponatremia of 122 mmol/L. Magnetic resonance imaging disclosed a metastatic pituitary tumor, and endocrinological examinations confirmed panhypopituitarism, including secondary adrenal insufficiency. The patient also experienced anorexia and fatigue. Hydrocortisone replacement revealed masked diabetes insipidus with elevation of serum sodium levels that reached 151 mmol/L. Desmopressin administration was required to prevent water depletion and to immediately ameliorate the hypernatremia. The final diagnoses were adrenal insufficiency, diabetes insipidus, and lung adenocarcinoma.
