A 50-year-old man with a 30 pack-year smoking history, no prior history of TB, and no family history of cancer, presented with a dry cough and dyspnea for 4 months. He reported frequent contact with dogs and farm animals and lived in an agricultural sheep-grazing area. He denied fever, night sweats, and significant weight loss. Physical examination revealed dullness at percussion and diminished breath sounds over the left lower lung field.

A chest radiograph demonstrated an opaque left hemithorax with ipsilateral attraction of the mediastinum. CT of the chest revealed a large cystic mass occupying the entire left hemithorax. Hydatid serology was negative. Bronchoscopy revealed an endobronchial mass occluding the left upper lobe entrance.

Biopsy of the endobronchial mass showed a tumor arranged in a cribriform pattern. Tumor cells showed a rounded, hyperchromatic nucleus surrounding pseudoglandular cavities filled with mucoid material. Immunohistochemical study found tumor cells to be thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF1) negative. Features were those of adenoid cystic carcinoma.

Cervicofacial MRI was performed and was without abnormalities.

PET scan and brain scan showed a solid cystic left pulmonary process occupying the entire left hemithorax as well as mediastinal lymphadenopathy in the right paratracheal and hilar and hypermetabolic micronodules of the right upper lobe. The tumor was classified as T4N3M1a according to the TNM classification, eighth edition, Stage IVa.

Given the stage (IVa) and despite his performance status (PS) of 0, the patient was treated with palliative chemotherapy.

After three sessions of chemotherapy and 8 months of postdiagnosis evolution, the patient presented to the department in poor general condition (PS: 3).

Thoracic CT scan showed a significant decrease in the volume of the lung mass. Chest X-ray showed a left opaque hemithorax. Thoracic computed tomography noted the presence of a large, well-limited solid-cystic mass occupying the entire left hemithorax. Microscopic appearance showed (A) malignant tumor proliferation of cribriform architecture and (B) tumor cells did not express TTF1 (thyroid transcription factor 1).

The patient underwent palliative chemotherapy.
