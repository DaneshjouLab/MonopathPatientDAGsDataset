A 50-year-old man presented with cough and sputum for several weeks. He had a significant smoking history of two packets of cigarettes per day for 35 years and an occupational history of painting with likely asbestos exposure. Chest X-ray revealed a large amount of unilateral pleural effusion. Further investigation revealed diminished breathing sounds in the left lung. Lab tests showed elevated white blood cells (12000/\u03bcL), platelets (41.1\u2009\u00d7\u2009104/\u03bcL), and cytokeratin 19 fragments (7.6 ng/mL). Eosinophils in the peripheral blood were 3%. Repeat chest X\u2010ray and contrast\u2010enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed moderate left pleural effusion. 850 mL of pleural effusion was drained. Pleural effusion analysis revealed it was exudate with 1342 cells/\u03bcL. Cell classification showed 4% neutrophils, 47% eosinophils, 36% lymphocytes, and 10% monocytes. Pleural effusion cytology revealed many atypical cells with prominent eosinophilic nucleoli, solitary to aggregated, raising suspicion for malignancy. Immunocytochemical study showed calretinin, thrombomodulin, D2\u201040, EMA, and E\u2010cadherin were positive, and TTF\u20101, Napsin A, CEA, and MOC\u201031 were negative, further supporting the suspicion of malignant pleural mesothelioma. P16 homozygous deletion was confirmed by p16 fluorescence in situ hybridization (45% of tumor cells showed loss of both p16 gene signals). Thoracoscopic biopsy of parietal pleura confirmed tumor invasion to the pleura and adipose tissue, confirming the diagnosis of malignant pleural mesothelioma.
