A 47-year-old male with a past medical history significant for heavy smoking, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and previous intravenous drug use presented to the emergency department with persistent nonradiating pain in the right hypochondrium, nausea, anorexia, early satiety, and an 11-kg weight loss over 1 month. Physical examination revealed painful hepatomegaly. Laboratory values demonstrated microcytic normochromic anemia (Hb 7.2 g/dL), elevated alkaline phosphatase (254 U/L), and elevated gamma-glutamyl transferase (287 U/L).

To investigate the cause of these symptoms, the patient underwent abdominal ultrasound, thoraco-abdominopelvic CT, and upper endoscopy with biopsies. Abdominal ultrasound showed an enlarged and diffusely nodular liver. Thoraco-abdominopelvic CT demonstrated a 2-cm nodule in the inferior lobe of the left lung and signs of diffuse hepatic metastases. Upper endoscopy revealed a 1-cm ulcerated nodular lesion in the greater curvature of the gastric body. Biopsies demonstrated submucosal infiltration of small hyperchromatic cells with scant cytoplasm.

Immunohistochemistry of the gastric lesion and liver biopsy were performed to determine the type and origin of the cancer. Immunohistochemistry of the gastric lesion revealed diffuse immunoreactivity to CAM5.2, synaptophysin, and chromogranin, compatible with gastric infiltration of neoplastic cells with neuroendocrine differentiation. Liver biopsy showed similar histology. Bronchoalveolar lavage cytology and bronchial biopsy revealed TTF-1-positive cells with similar expression of neuroendocrine markers, confirming small cell lung cancer (SCLC).

Based on imaging and biopsy results, a diagnosis of stage IV small cell lung cancer (SCLC) was established. CT scan showed a 2-cm nodular lesion in the upper segment of the inferior lobe of the left lung and a 3.7 x 2.4 cm infracarinal adenomegaly. Hepatomegaly and diffuse hepatic metastases were present. A nodular lesion with central ulceration was noted in the greater curvature in the body of the stomach.

Palliative chemotherapy was initiated to treat the stage IV small cell lung cancer (SCLC).

The patient experienced nonspecific upper gastrointestinal symptoms with red flag signs, prompting an endoscopic evaluation. Gastric submucosal infiltration of hyperchromatic small neoplastic cells was observed (H&E, Ã—20). Liver biopsy demonstrated severe infiltration of liver parenchyma by neoplastic cells, with frequent figures of mitosis (arrow) and apoptosis. Liver biopsy demonstrated immunohistochemical expression of chromogranin neoplastic cells.

Neuroendocrine markers chromogranin and synaptophysin were strongly positive in the gastric lesion, suggesting gastric involvement by a neuroendocrine neoplasm, later confirmed as a SCLC metastasis. The patient's functional status rapidly deteriorated, and he died 3 months after the diagnosis.
