A patient presented with a complex medical history involving both pulmonary and cardiovascular issues. The patient was diagnosed with early-stage lung cancer, specifically clinical stage T1bN0M0 stage IA2. The lung cancer was later identified as invasive papillary adenocarcinoma, staged as pT1bN0M0, stage IA2. The patient also exhibited lung emphysema.

In addition to the lung cancer, the patient was diagnosed with partial anomalous pulmonary venous return (PAPVR), a congenital malformation where a pulmonary vein partially refluxes into the venous system. This condition contributed to cardiac and respiratory complications, including right-sided heart failure. The patient experienced respiratory/right-sided heart failure symptoms, dyspnea, and palpitations.

The patient's condition was further complicated by the presence of emphysema. The patient experienced heart failure. Later, the patient experienced lung cancer recurrence.
