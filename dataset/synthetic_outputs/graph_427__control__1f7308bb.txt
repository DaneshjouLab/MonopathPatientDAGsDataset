A 51-year-old man was diagnosed with advanced lung adenocarcinoma. Initial gene sequencing revealed no sensitive driver gene mutation. He received pemetrexed and cisplatin plus bevacizumab as first-line therapy. Subsequently, he was treated with pembrolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel as second-line therapy and soon developed neurological symptoms. He was then diagnosed with leptomeningeal metastasis (LM) based on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology. A rebiopsy of lung tissue revealed an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) sensitive mutation. The patient was initially treated with high-dose (160mg) osimertinib, but he could not tolerate the severe neurological symptoms and developed a cardiac adverse event. The treatment was then changed to standard-dose (80mg) osimertinib plus anlotinib, which resulted in the alleviation of his neurological symptoms. At the most recent follow-up, the curative effect was evaluated as stable disease (SD), and the patient had achieved a progression-free survival (PFS) of more than 15 months.
