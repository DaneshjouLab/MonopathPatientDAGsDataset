A 65-year-old woman with a history of palmoplantar pustulosis presented with a breast mass and a chest mass. Biopsy specimens from both the lung mass and the breast mass revealed small cell carcinoma (SCLC) in both lesions. The breast mass was determined to be a metastatic lesion from primary SCLC. Comprehensive staging, including contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain and FDG-PET, led to a diagnosis of stage cT2aN3M1c. PET-CT scan revealed multiple bone metastases, peritoneal metastases, and skin metastases in addition to the primary lesion in the right upper lobe and the right breast. Enhanced chest CT examination revealed a primary lesion in the right upper lobe, as well as a heterogeneous mass in the right breast. Histological analysis revealed diffuse proliferation of small tumor cells with a high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic (N/C) ratio on Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining. Immunohistochemistry showed Synaptophysin staining negative, Chromogranin staining negative, and INSM1 staining positive. First-line treatment was initiated with carboplatin (CBDCA), etoposide (ETP), and durvalumab, administered in the sequence of durvalumab, followed by ETP, and then CBDCA. During the first course of treatment, the patient experienced anaphylactic shock while receiving an ETP infusion on day 1. ETP administration was immediately discontinued. The anaphylactic shock was treated with cimetidine, dexamethasone, and chlorpheniramine, along with a saline infusion. Treatment was subsequently switched to combination therapy with cisplatin (CDDP) and irinotecan (CPT-11).
