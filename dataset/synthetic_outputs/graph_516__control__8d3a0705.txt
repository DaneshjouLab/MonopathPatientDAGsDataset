A 54-year-old woman with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) developed pneumonitis at 3 months after radiotherapy, which was regarded as radiation pneumonitis (RP). Later, at 10 months after radiotherapy, she developed radiation recall pneumonitis (RRP) induced by anti-PD-1 sintilimab. This unique case of double pneumonitis (RP and RRP) highlights the importance of identifying immune or radiation pneumonitis, understanding its potential mechanism, and determining the appropriate treatment strategy after the emergence of RRP. Radiation pneumonitis (RP) is an acute inflammation that typically occurs within 6 months, most often within 12 weeks, after the end of radiation therapy (RT). Radiation recall pneumonitis (RRP) is an unpredictable acute inflammatory reaction within the previously irradiated lung area during the course of systematic therapy. RRP is mainly associated with chemotherapeutic drugs and EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), whereas RRP induced by immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has been rarely reported.
