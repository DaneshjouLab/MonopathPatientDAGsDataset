A 74-year-old man with a history of lung cancer was admitted to the hospital on January 9, 2024, due to blood in the stool. He presented to the emergency department with a 5-hour history of black stools, reporting three large bowel movements of black stool without vomiting blood. He also reported panic, weakness, and no abdominal pain or distension. Initial assessment revealed a hemoglobin level of 58 g/L, indicating active bleeding. He was diagnosed with acute upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage.

The patient was admitted to the gastroenterology department and treated with blood transfusions, fluid supplementation, hemostasis, and acidic gastric protection. A CT scan of the chest and abdomen revealed localized thickening of the small bowel wall in the left lower abdomen with multiple surrounding lymph nodes, suggesting small bowel occupancy with peripheral lymph node metastasis. Oral small bowel imaging showed gastritis, but no significant abnormalities in the jejunum, ileum, and ileocecum region. Double-balloon enteroscopy revealed small bowel occupation and bleeding, along with submucosal elevation, possibly representing lipoma. Esophageal lesions were diagnosed as non-atrophic gastritis.

Immunohistochemistry results showed P53 (wild type expression), Ki67 (basal high expression), SMARCA4 (deletion), CK7 (+), TTF-1 (-), Napsin A (-), SPA (-), SP-B (-), CK20 (-), Villin (focal +), CDX-2 (-), SATB2 (individually weakly plus), CK5/6 (-), P40 (-), and Ki67 (+ 65%). These findings supported a diagnosis of small bowel metastasis from lung adenocarcinoma causing gastrointestinal bleeding.

On January 20, 2024, the patient underwent laparoscopic radical resection for small bowel cancer. During surgery, a small bowel tumor was found 200 cm from the beginning of the jejunum. The distal lumen of the small bowel and lumen of the colon were covered with black blood, confirming gastrointestinal hemorrhage.

Currently, the patient's overall condition is good, and he is undergoing combined chemotherapy. The long-term prognosis remains to be observed and followed.
