A patient, a chronic smoker, presented with respiratory distress, including a dry cough, dyspnea, polypnea, and cyanosis of the extremities. The patient also exhibited respiratory struggle. Despite the severity of symptoms, the patient's general condition was preserved. Pleuropulmonary examination revealed crackles. Initial investigations included a chest X-ray, which showed bilateral alveolar opacities. The patient also exhibited desaturation and blood hypereosinophilia. COVID-19 PCR and GeneXpert for tuberculosis were negative.

Further investigation with a thoracic CT scan revealed ground glass areas and diffuse condensations. Given the hypereosinophilia and lung findings, eosinophilic lung was considered. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and induced sputum were performed. A CT-guided biopsy was also conducted.

The patient was initially treated with corticosteroid therapy, later specified as systemic corticosteroid therapy.

Pathological examination of the biopsy revealed lepidic adenocarcinoma, a type of lung cancer and one of the primary lung cancers. The CT scan also showed diffuse alveolar opacities, pulmonary nodules, and areas of ground glass. The patient's dyspnea worsened. The final diagnosis was lepidic adenocarcinoma with associated eosinophilic lung.
