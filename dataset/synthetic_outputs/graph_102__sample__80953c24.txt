In April 2015, a 27-year-old male was diagnosed with left upper lung adenocarcinoma by biopsy. The patient's performance status score was 1. Clinical staging was cT3N2M0 (stage IIIA, 7thUICC/AJCC). The initial tumor was considered unresectable due to adjacency to the pericardium and regional lymph node metastasis at the ipsilateral mediastinum. Histological features of the adenocarcinoma included solid growth with mucus production (60%) and acinar growth (40%). The patient received three cycles of gemcitabine (1250mg/m2, day 1 and day 8) plus cisplatin (75 mg/m2, day 1). Positive ALK expression was detected by Ventana immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining. A contrast chest computed tomography (CT) after 3 cycles of gemcitabine plus cisplatin showed that the primary tumor remained stable according to the RECIST 1.1 criteria compared with the initial CT scan. Crizotinib (250 mg, bid) was then adopted, replacing the initial treatment. Within 2 months of Crizotinib treatment, the patient was downstaged to cT2aN2M0. In September 2015, video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) with left upper lobectomy plus lymph node dissection and partial pericardial resection was performed. Pathological stage was ypT2aN2M0. Postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) was performed with a total dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions.
