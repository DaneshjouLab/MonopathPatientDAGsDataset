A non-small-cell lung cancer patient was diagnosed with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer, specifically lung adenocarcinoma. This patient, an elderly patient with NSCLC, developed severe steroid-refractory checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis (CIP) after treatment. Checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis is a known immune-related adverse event, and can be a fatal adverse event. The severity of CIP can range, with grade â‰¥3 CIP being particularly concerning. Patients with NSCLC with CIP may be steroid refractory. Severe steroid-refractory CIP is associated with higher mortality during CIP treatment. The clinical phenotype of CIP and the pathological process of CIP are important considerations for better management of CIP. Differential diagnoses to consider include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary fibrosis, tumoral involvement, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, chronic interstitial lung diseases, progressive phenotype, and coronavirus disease 2019. Treatment options beyond steroids include immunosuppression therapy and anti-fibrotic treatment.
