A patient was diagnosed with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma with EGFR mutations in November 2018. The patient was administered gefitinib daily (250mg) for activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations (exon 19 deletions, 19del), and combined with platinum-based dual-drug chemotherapy as a first-line targeted treatment. During the target treatments, the optimal efficacy evaluation was partial remission (PR) with a 12-month progression-free survival (PFS) time. Later, the intracranial progression of the patient rendered the treatment change to erlotinib. Surprisingly, the tumor lesion in brain as well as lung relieved obviously. His progression-free survival (PFS) was nearly 11 months, and the overall survival (OS) was >36 months up to now. The adverse events were tolerable. This case manifests that re-biopsy of advanced or recurrent NSCLC is beneficial to make a better therapeutic regimen, and erlotinib can be used as a salvage treatment after gefitinib failure.
