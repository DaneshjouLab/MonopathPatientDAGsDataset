This clinical case report describes a series of patients presenting with various peritoneal and omental abnormalities, often discovered incidentally.

**Case 1:** A 56-year-old female presented with a left lower quadrant mass in proximity to the bowel. CT imaging showed the mass was partially calcified. The patient underwent resection of the mass along with segmental small bowel resection.

**Case 2:** A 49-year-old male was found to have omental thickening in the pelvis and right lower quadrant, reminiscent of peritoneal “carcinomatosis,” incidentally found during a hernia repair. The patient had a remote history of osteosarcoma more than 3 decades ago that was treated with chemotherapy with complete response. He also had vague nodularity in the peritoneum (bladder, side wall, mesoappendix, bowel, perirectal), with the largest nodule measuring 0.8 cm, incidentally identified during the hernia repair.

**Case 3:** A 67-year-old female with a history of hemicolectomy for early-stage colonic adenocarcinoma 5 years prior, presented with a 3.5 cm unifocal mass at the gastrohepatic ligament incidentally identified by surveillance imaging. The patient underwent resection of the mass and was diagnosed with malignant mesothelioma via biopsy. She subsequently underwent cytoreductive surgery that included total pelvic peritonectomy to resect all gross lesions and removal of hernia mesh, followed by 4 cycles of adjuvant intraperitoneal chemotherapy (cisplatin/mitomycin). Follow-up imaging showed no recurrence or progression of disease. The patient is alive with no evidence of disease at 24 months follow-up.

**Case 4:** A 56-year-old female had a 7.0 cm unifocal mass in the peritoneum (mesentery) incidentally identified by imaging. The patient underwent surgical resection and is alive with no evidence of disease at 1 month follow-up.

**Case 5:** A 61-year-old male had thickened omentum in the peritoneum (diaphragm, ligamentum falciforme, appendix, spleen, omentum) with peritoneal carcinomatosis (clinical + radiological). The patient underwent surgical resection.

**Case 6:** A 68-year-old male had masses in the peritoneum (inguinal, omentum) incidentally identified during hernia repair with massive ascites. The patient underwent surgical resection of the masses in the peritoneum. Gross pathologic examination showed solitary or multinodular masses, displaying mostly cellular and solid epithelioid phenotypes with heterogenous architectural patterns. Case 1 and Case 3 were both solitary, circumscribed masses measuring 7 cm and 5 cm, respectively, in greatest dimensions.

**Case 7:** A 61-year-old male had thickened omentum in the peritoneum. Gross examination showed no discrete masses.
