A 65-year-old male presented with a one-year history of gradually worsening cough and shortness of breath. He denied hemoptysis or chest pain. The patient reported occasional dry mouth and dry eyes, but denied itchy skin, desquamation, or joint pain. Physical examination revealed normal skin and mucosa, with no rash or scaling.

The patient had no significant past medical or family history. Auscultation revealed velcro rales in both lower lung fields. A chest CT scan showed interstitial inflammation and fibrosis in the basal segments of the bilateral lower lobes (Fig. 1). Lung function tests demonstrated a moderate diffusion disorder (DLCO 54.6% predictive value).

A chest HRCT scan indicated interstitial lung inflammation with imaging features of NSIP. Full blood count, basic metabolic panel, ECG, and echocardiography were all normal. Anti-endothelial cell antibody (AECA) was positive (1:100), but other vasculitis-related self-antibodies were negative. Antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-CCP, anti-SSA, anti-SSB, Ro-52, anti-nRNP, anti-Sm, anti-Jo1, anti-PM-Scl, anti-Scl-70, and anti-dsDNA antibodies were all negative.

A myositis antibody panel was positive for anti-TIF1Î³ self-antibody. Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with Interstitial Pneumonia with Autoimmune Features (IPAF). PET-CT scans and serum tumor marker analysis showed no evidence of any tumor.

The patient was started on oral prednisone (30 mg) once a day and pirfenidone (600 mg) three times per day.

The patient did not return for follow-up due to the COVID-19 epidemic in China at the end of 2019. He was admitted to the respiratory department on August 6th, 2020, presenting with aggravated shortness of breath over the previous 3 months. An enhanced chest CT scan showed an irregularly shaped nodule located on the anterior segment of the right upper lobe.

The scan also revealed enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes in the right hilum and mediastinum. Enhanced CT of the abdomen revealed bilateral adrenal nodules. A brain MRI revealed multiple metastatic nodules in the bilateral cerebral hemispheres.

CT-guided percutaneous lung biopsy of the right lung nodule and needle aspiration of mediastinal lymph nodes under endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) was performed.

The patient was diagnosed with right lung squamous carcinoma with mediastinal lymph node, brain, and adrenal glands metastasis. EBUS-TBNA of enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes (N7 group) revealed atypical epithelioid neoplasm.
