Here's a reconstructed clinical case report based on the provided data:

This article describes two cases of pulmonary inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors (IMTs) in the lungs of adult males. Pulmonary inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors (IMTs) are rarely reported in adult males. Given the low incidence of IMT and the lack of imaging references and pathological guidance, the misdiagnosis rate of IMT is high.

Both patients presented with lesions in the right lobe and a history of pulmonary tuberculosis, along with a long period of refractory intermittent pulmonary inflammation. Both patients experienced intermittent cough symptoms, but pulmonary IMTs were not suspected for a long time.

Prior to the confirmation of IMT, both patients were diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis and treated with either isoniazid (H), rifampin (R), pyrazinamide (Z), and ethambutol (E) (HRZE) or isoniazid (H), levofloxacin (L), pyrazinamide (Z), and ethambutol (E) (HLZE) for months.

In Case 2, imaging revealed multiple subpleural cord signs in the left lung, soft tissue mass shadows at the apex of the right upper lobe, a thickened interlobular interval, and scattered patches and nodules in the upper right lung.

Pathological findings from the lower right lung lesion in both cases revealed a great deal of myofibroblasts, fibroblasts and collagen fibers, accompanied by a large number of plasma cells and foam cell infiltration, which were consistent with the features of IMT.
