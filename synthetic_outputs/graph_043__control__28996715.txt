A 45-year-old female, a smoker for 25 years with no other comorbidities, and metastatic lung cancer developed colitis after the seventh cycle of pembrolizumab. Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICIs) like pembrolizumab, which target the PD-1 receptor of lymphocytes, can cause immune-related adverse events (irAEs) due to loss of immunoregulatory control. ICIs-induced colitis, a common irAE, typically develops 6â€“8 weeks after ICI initiation. The case highlights the importance of early recognition and intervention to prevent permanent interruption of checkpoint inhibitor treatment and colitis complications. Colonoscopy is recommended for patients with grade 2 or higher symptoms, along with systemic corticosteroids and potentially biologic therapy based on response. The colon mucosa may show normal macroscopic findings, but microscopically, immunotherapy-induced autoimmune colitis could be present. Colitis is an important IrAE and a leading cause of hospitalization and quality of life deterioration during ICI treatment.
