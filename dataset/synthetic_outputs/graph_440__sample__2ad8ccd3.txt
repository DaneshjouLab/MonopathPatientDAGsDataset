A 72-year-old male with diabetes mellitus was diagnosed in July 2012 with KRAS.pG12D-positive T1N0M0 adenocarcinoma of the ascending colon and cecum. He underwent a right hemicolectomy with an end-to-end anastomosis. Following surgery, he received oral chemotherapy with Capecitabine (500 mg, Once Daily (OD)) for 4 months. In October 2014, an 18F-FDG PET-CT detected a hypermetabolic nodular lesion with spiculated margins in the anterior segment of the upper lobe of the left lung, suspected of metastasis from the primary colon cancer. He was again treated with oral Capecitabine (500 mg, OD) for 2 months. However, in October 2015, a chest X-ray indicated persistent and increased size of the lesion in the anterior segment of the left upper lobe of the lung, indicating non-response to Capecitabine. Liquid biopsy analysis of circulating cell-free tumor DNA (ctDNA) indicated the absence of the KRAS.pG12D mutation, but the presence of an exon 19 deletion mutation (pE746-A750del) in the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) gene.
