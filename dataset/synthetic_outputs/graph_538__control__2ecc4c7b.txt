A 32-year-old primigravid healthcare worker presented at 16 weeks’ gestation with a single episode of large volume haemoptysis associated with shortness of breath and wheeze. On examination, she had decreased air entry at the left upper zone. She had a sinus tachycardia of 120 beats/min, saturating at 98% on room air and was afebrile. An initial chest X-ray was performed showing left upper lobe consolidation. A CT pulmonary angiogram demonstrated a tumour mass arising from the distal left main bronchus, measuring 35×25 mm with invasion into the mediastinum and complete collapse of the left upper lobe. There was attenuated vasculature of the hyperexpanded left lower lobe, multiple left-sided subpleural blebs and a left small loculated medial pneumothorax. There was thickening and irregularity of the left visceral pleura. The right lung was normal and there was no pulmonary embolism. She had a bronchoscopy showing a large globular mass at the distal left main bronchus, which was completely occluding the lumen. The lesion was partially debulked and biopsy showed typical pulmonary carcinoid with a proliferation index (Ki-67)<2%. A repeat inspection bronchoscopy showed stable intraluminal disease at 22 weeks’ gestation. There were no further episodes of haemoptysis and the patient remained.
