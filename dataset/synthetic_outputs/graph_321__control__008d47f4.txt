A 58-year-old woman presented with synchronous multiple tumor lesions in separate lungs. She was diagnosed with synchronous multiple primary lung cancer (SMPLC). Using next-generation sequencing, a discordant EGFR gene profile was revealed from the separate lungs. After standard treatment procedures, the therapeutic effects were evaluated by response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST). The case highlights the essential role of combining molecular features with pathological analysis in the management of SMPLC. The patient also had lung adenocarcinoma (AC).
