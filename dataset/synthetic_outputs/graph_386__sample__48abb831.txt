A 61-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension was diagnosed in July 2020 with a locally advanced lung adenocarcinoma PDL1: 0%. He received first-line carboplatin, pemetrexed, and pembrolizumab, followed by maintenance pembrolizumab from January 2021. The best response achieved was a partial response maintained until September 2021. During treatment, he developed several immune-related grade 2 toxicities: thyroiditis, pruritus, and pituitary insufficiency. Thoracic radiotherapy was administered due to isolated progression of the primitive lung lesion, resulting in a partial response. In August 2021, after one year of anti-PD1 treatment, the patient complained of alternating diarrhea and constipation. In September 2021, he was hospitalized for occlusive syndrome associated with acute urine retention. A thoraco-abdomino-pelvic CT scan showed only aerogrelia and a dolichocolon with no junction syndrome. Exploratory laparoscopy revealed a 1.6-cm mesenteric metastatic nodule. Upper digestive tract fibroscopy revealed simple gastritis. Biopsy showed congestive gastric mucosal antritis within normal limits. Whole-body FDG-PET showed no pathological hyperfixation at the subdiaphragmatic level and no sign of disease progression. Serum auto-Ab (Hu, Yo, RI, CV2, amphiphisin, MA1 and 2, LGI1 and CASPR2) testing was negative. Pembrolizumab treatment was stopped. Prostigmine and metoclopramide were ineffective. Intravenous corticosteroids (2mg/kg) for 2 weeks did not improve clinical symptoms. Ultimately, the patient required exclusively parenteral nutrition, a discharge gastrostomy, and bladder self-catheterization.
