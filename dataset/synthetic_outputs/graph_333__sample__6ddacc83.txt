A patient underwent excision and removal of the ligamentum teres hepatis for histological diagnosis (N1). In the post-operative period, the patient evacuated gas and stool after resumption of oral intake (N2). The patient was discharged from the hospital uneventfully on the third day post-operation (N3). Histopathological evaluation of the ligamentum teres biopsy was positive for mesothelin, calretinin, CK 5/6, and vimentin. Histopathological evaluation of the ligamentum teres biopsy showed focal positivity for EMA and weak positivity for MUC-1. Stains for WT-1, CEA, CD15, BER-EP-4, CA 72-4, TTF-1, and mucicarmine were all negative (N4). Approximately 10 days post-discharge, the patient was readmitted to the hospital due to abdominal pain and distention. Examination revealed peritoneal irritation signs, including abdominal distention and rebound tenderness (N5). Abdominal radiograph showed air-fluid levels in the loops of the small bowel. Chest film was normal. Physical examination revealed a body temperature of 36.5 \u00b0C, blood pressure of 130/85 mmHg, and a pulse rate of 84 bpm. Abdomen was distended with marked diffuse tenderness, but rebound tenderness and guarding were absent. Bowel sounds were normoactive (N6).
