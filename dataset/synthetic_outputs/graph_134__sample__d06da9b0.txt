A 48-year-old man presented with clinical stage IVB (cT1bN0M1c) lung adenocarcinoma harboring an EGFR L858R mutation, along with diffuse osteoblastic bone metastases in the trunk and proximal limbs and cancerous pleurisy. Laboratory test results before treatment showed a corrected calcium level of 8.3 mg/dL, urinary calcium level of 7.3 mg/dL, and ALP level of 1353 U/L with normal renal function. The patient was treated with gefitinib 250 mg/d as the first-line treatment, followed by denosumab (120 mg) two days later. Three days after denosumab administration, the patient experienced tetany and QT prolongation (QTc, 500 ms) due to denosumab-induced hypocalcemia, diagnosed via laboratory examination (corrected serum calcium level, 5.6 mg/dL and urinary calcium level, 0.4 mg/dL). The patient was started on alfacalcidol (3 \u03bcg/d) and calcium gluconate hydrate (initial intravenous injection of 7.8 mEq, with subsequent intravenous infusion of 93.6 mEq/d) on day 4. Corrected serum calcium levels were improving, but urinary calcium level did not recover for several weeks. Oral calcium lactate (15 g/d) was administered in addition to alfacalcidol (4 \u03bcg/d). Intravenous calcium gluconate was gradually reduced. On day 61, after adjusting treatment (11.7 mEq) to three times a week, the corrected serum calcium level was maintained. The same treatment was continued at the outpatient clinic after discharge.
