A 44-year-old male presented with a 2-month history of right-sided chest pain, dry cough, on-off fever, and hematuria. The patient reported no prior Antitubercular treatment (ATT) and had a history of tobacco chewing for over 20 years. Physical examination revealed decreased air entry on the right side of the lung.

Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of the thorax revealed a heterogeneous lesion in the mediastinal region abutting the horizontal fissure with cavitation. Chest imaging also showed multiple centrilobular nodules arranged in a linear branching pattern.

To investigate the lesion, bronchoscopy with bronchoscopic-guided biopsy and Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed. BAL fluid was negative for malignant cells, but the biopsy was suggestive of squamous cell carcinoma.

The patient subsequently reported decreased and blurring of vision. An ophthalmology opinion was obtained, which was within normal limits.

An 18F-FDG PET/CT scan was performed to assess the extent of the disease. The scan revealed an FDG-avid well-defined soft tissue primary mass measuring 5.6 cm x 7.7 cm x 8.3 cm with spiculated margins in the upper lobe of the right lung with collapse and consolidation of the right lung. FDG avid metastases to mediastinal, abdominopelvic lymph nodes and right-sided pleural deposits with multiple sub-centimetric to centimetric-sized bilateral lung nodules were noted. Multiple FDG avid brain lesions involving the bilateral cerebral cortex, cerebellum and pituitary were also identified. The PET/CT scan also showed FDG avid bilateral hypodense renal masses (largest measuring 2.8 cm x 2.6 cm), multiple lytic skeletal lesions with soft tissue component involvement, FDG-avid right-sided lung mass with abdominal lymph node, and FDG-avid soft tissue lesion in the pituitary. Another peripheral enhancing hypodense soft tissue lesion was noted in the left cerebral hemisphere. CT and fused PET/CT axial images showed a right parietal-occipital bone lytic lesion with soft tissue component involvement. Metabolically active soft tissue lesions were noted involving bilateral kidneys with extensive metastasis.

Following the PET/CT findings, the patient presented with severe headaches and blurring of vision for 15 days.

Biopsy results confirmed metastatic involvement.
