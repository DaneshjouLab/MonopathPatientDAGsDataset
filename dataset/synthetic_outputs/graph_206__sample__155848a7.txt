A 26-year-old woman presented with severe lower abdominal pain, dysmenorrhea, deep dyspareunia, dyschezia and occasional rectal bleeding. Examination showed restricted uterine mobility and a rectovaginal nodule. A Mirena coil was placed for cyclical symptoms, but the patient's symptoms persisted. Consequently, she was started on gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogues (GNRHa) with add-back hormone replacement therapy (HRT), and was given a preliminary diagnosis of endometriosis. MRI revealed multiple clear cystic structures in the pelvis, adenomyosis, bilateral endometriomas and adhesions between the uterus and posterior rectosigmoid junction. A T2 sagittal MRI through the mid-pelvis showed the uterus had a large focal area of adenomyosis and was tethered to the rectum by deep infiltrating endometriosis. Posterior to this, there was a multiloculated fluid collection, histologically proven to be mesothelioma. Due to imaging not being entirely consistent with the diagnosis of endometriosis, a diagnostic laparoscopy was performed. MRI showed a separate endometrioma cranial to the bladder and uterine fundus. T2 axial MRI through the mid-pelvis showed bilateral endometriomas with intervening multiloculated fluid collections, histologically proven to represent mesothelioma.
