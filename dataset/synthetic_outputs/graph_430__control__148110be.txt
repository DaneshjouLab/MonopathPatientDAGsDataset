A patient presented with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) and brain metastases. The patient's tumor was found to have a KRAS exon 2 p.G12D mutation in the KRAS proto-oncogene, GTPase (KRAS). The patient's case also involved metastatic tumor, primary tumors, lung adenocarcinoma, and pulmonary nodules. Other genes of interest in the context of the patient's NSCLC included epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), b-raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase (BRAF), erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (ERBB2), ALK receptor tyrosine kinase (ALK), ROS proto-oncogene 1, receptor tyrosine kinase (ROS1), ret proto-oncogene (RET), mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK), neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase 1 (NTRK1), NTRK2, and NTRK3. The patient experienced a pathologic fracture, oxygen desaturation, and asystole, ultimately leading to gastric perforation, massive peritonitis, and death. The patient's condition progressed to metastatic disease, with a clival lesion and malignant cells identified. The patient's initial diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma evolved into metastatic adenocarcinoma, originating from a primary lung tumor. Analysis of metastatic tumor tissue revealed DNA copy number aberrations (CNAs). The patient did not have small cell carcinoma (SCC).
