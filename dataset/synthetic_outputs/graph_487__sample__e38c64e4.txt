A patient was diagnosed with limited-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC) at Peking University Cancer Hospital on August 1, 2020. Following the diagnosis, the patient was administered four cycles of carboplatin plus etoposide combined with duvalizumab. After chemotherapy, the patient's primary tumor was partially reduced in size. The patient then received a total of 30 radiotherapy sessions to the primary lung cancer lesion in the right hilar region. Subsequently, the patient was diagnosed with extensive stage-small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) and brain metastases. The patient then received bevacizumab in combination with irinotecan as a post-fourth-line therapy. This resulted in a significant partial response, with the tumor significantly reduced in size after chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The patient then received preventive cranial irradiation to prevent brain metastasis, followed by 12 cycles of immune maintenance therapy until lesion recurrence in December 2021. From early December 2021 to February 2022, the patient received the original chemotherapy regimen again for four cycles at Peking University Cancer Hospital.
