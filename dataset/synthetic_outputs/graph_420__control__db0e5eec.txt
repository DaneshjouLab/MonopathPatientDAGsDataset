Cancer is a global public health concern and the second leading cause of death worldwide. The cancer burden continues to grow globally, with many cancer patients lacking access to timely, quality diagnosis and treatment. South Africa is experiencing a quadruple burden of disease, including an increase in non-communicable diseases (NCDs), to which cancer contributes greatly. It is estimated that 1 in 7 women and 1 in 6 men are at risk of developing cancer in their lifetime. The observed increase in cancer burden is attributable to increasing aging, population growth, and increased prevalence of risk factors associated with economic transition, such as smoking, obesity, physical inactivity, reproductive behaviors, and westernized diets.

A retrospective survey was conducted using the database of Frere Hospital Oncology-Radiation Unit to study cancer in the Buffalo City (BFC) population, Eastern Cape (EC) Province, for the period 1991-2009. The study calculated the top cancer sites and identified the two most common cancers in males and females. The most common cancers among women are breast, cervix, colorectal, uterus and lung. The reported common cancers among men are prostate, colorectal, lung, bladder and oesophagus.

The study found that lung and prostate cancers decreased in males, while cervical and breast cancers remained stable in females. Black Africans with lung cancer were five times more likely to have prostate cancer (95% CI: 3.90-6.21). Black Africans with cervical cancer were three times more likely to have breast cancer (95% CI: 2.45-3.14).

The routine cancer data collected at Frere Hospital contributes to strengthening the national cancer notification regulation. However, the burden of cancer in the EC Province remains high. Lung, prostate, colorectal, stomach and liver cancers are the most common types in men, while breast, colorectal, lung, cervical and thyroid cancers are the most common among women.
