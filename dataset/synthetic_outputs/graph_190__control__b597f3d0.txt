A case report describes a patient with advanced lung adenocarcinoma harboring a novel non-reciprocal *ALK* fusion, specifically *ALK-C2orf91*(intergenic) (A19: intergenic) and *PPFIA1*-*ALK* (P2:A20), identified by next-generation DNA sequencing. The patient was treated with alectinib. After 2 months of alectinib treatment, the targeted lung lesion regressed significantly, and evaluation of therapeutic efficiency indicated a partial response. The patient achieved 12 months of progression-free survival from alectinib treatment. This case extends the spectrum of *ALK* fusion partners in *ALK*-positive non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) and reports the sensitivity of the novel *PPFIA1*-*ALK* and *ALK*-*C2orf91*(intergenic) fusion to alectinib in lung cancer.
