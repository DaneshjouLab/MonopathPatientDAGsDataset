A patient experienced grade 3-4 cutaneous toxicity induced by PD-1 inhibitors. The patient was stabilized with Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) intervention and initiated glucocorticoid reduction. The patient was tapered off methylprednisolone (80mg/day intravenously for ten days) over four months to stop new blister formation, along with topical ointment. Subsequently, the patient developed a pulmonary fungal infection, suspected to be related to prolonged glucocorticoid use. Initially, the patient received a TCM prescription with Yu-Ping-Feng. After a week of intravenous methylprednisolone sodium succinate, the patient developed thirst, self-consciousness of dryness and heat, hyperphagia, and irritability. Damp-dispelling herbs were removed to protect Yin, and herbs clearing the Qi system were replaced with Bubali Cornu and Sophorae Flavescentis Radix to enhance the removal of heat-toxin. Mori Cortex, Aurantii Fructus, and Ophiopogonis Radix were added. The patient's stable status and normal liver function allowed a safe switch from intravenous methylprednisolone to oral prednisone, dosed once-daily.
