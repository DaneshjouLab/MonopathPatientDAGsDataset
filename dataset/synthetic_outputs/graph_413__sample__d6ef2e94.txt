A 50-year-old male with a 3-year history of Diabetes Mellitus presented with a 14-day history of non-productive cough, high-grade fever, and right-sided sharp pleuritic chest pain localized to the lower chest. The fever was sudden in onset, progressing from low-grade to high-grade over time, continuous without rigors or chills, and mildly relieved by medication temporarily. The patient had previously taken Oral Cefixime and Clarithromycin for 4 days with no improvement. His temperature was 103 F, and he maintained oxygen saturation (SO2) at room air.

Examination findings revealed a dull percussion note at the fourth to fifth intercostal space, with bronchial breathing and increased vocal resonance at the site. Laboratory results showed a total leucocyte count (TLC) of 21,000/\u03bcL, C\u2010reactive protein (CRP) of 113 mg/L, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 59 mm/h. A chest x\u2010ray (CXR) posterior\u2013anterior (PA) view showed a well\u2010circumscribed homogenous opacification in the right mid\u2010lower zone, concerning for a mass lesion.

The patient was hospitalized and initiated on Intravenous Ceftriaxone 2 g once a day. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan with contrast revealed the presence of numerous pulmonary nodules dispersed throughout the right lung. Patchy inflammatory alterations were observed at the base of the left lung. A region of soft tissue density was identified in the lower base of the right lung, accompanied by an enlargement of the right hilar lymph node measuring approximately (24\u2009\u00d7\u200912\u2009mm) in diameter. Clarithromycin administration continued.

Multiple prominent lymph nodes were detected in the right axilla, with the largest measuring about (23\u2009\u00d7\u20099)\u2009mm in diameter. The patient experienced episodes of elevated body temperature, characterized by high\u2010grade fevers mildly alleviated with the administration of paracetamol. Because the patient had no expectorant, an AFB smear test could not be conducted. The patient underwent a lung biopsy procedure with CT guidance.

The lung biopsy revealed chronic granulomatous inflammation characterized by Langerhans\u2010type multinucleated giant cells and widespread areas of caseous necrosis.

The patient was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and started on an anti\u2010tuberculosis treatment regime, including rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide in weight-adjusted dosages. The patient was shifted to an isolated room.

The patient was kept under observation for a week until the symptoms resolved.

After 4 weeks post-treatment, a follow-up chest x-ray showed improvement in the consolidation compared to the prior x-ray.
