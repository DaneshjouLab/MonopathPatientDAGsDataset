A patient presented with chest pain and dyspnoea. The patient's medical history included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and a possible predisposition to clotting disorders. Initial assessment included oxygen saturation monitoring and chest radiography. A computed tomography (CT) chest angiogram revealed a mass in the right pulmonary artery, raising suspicion for pulmonary thromboembolism. Enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes and pleural fluid were also noted.

Further investigation with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed intraluminal filling defects. A positron emission tomography (PET-CT) scan showed an invasive obstructing homogenous mass with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in the mediastinal lymph nodes.

An endoscopy-guided biopsy was performed, and histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of non-small-cell carcinoma. The initial suspicion of pulmonary thromboembolism was complicated by the presence of the tumour. The mass in the pulmonary artery was determined to be related to tumour embolisation.

The patient was initially started on anticoagulation therapy, presumably to address the suspected thromboembolism. However, given the diagnosis of non-small-cell carcinoma, the treatment plan was adjusted to include chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

Despite treatment, the patient developed metastasis. Further investigation revealed the presence of angiosarcoma, a rare type of sarcoma, within the intravascular lumen. The patient also experienced haemoptysis. The final diagnosis was a complex presentation of non-small-cell carcinoma with angiosarcoma, leading to tumour embolisation and mimicking pulmonary thromboembolism. The patient's prognosis was guarded given the advanced stage and aggressive nature of the malignancies.
