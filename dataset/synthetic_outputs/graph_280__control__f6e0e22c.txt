Case Report: A 59-year-old Chinese female patient presented with malignant peritoneal mesothelioma. The patient had a history of multiple relapses and was stable after treatment. Imaging revealed massive ascites and an irregular thickening of the peritoneal mesangium. Laparoscopic biopsy revealed heterogeneous cell nests in the parietal peritoneal fibrous tissue, which were confirmed by immunohistochemical staining for Calretinin, WT-1, and D2-40. Genetic screening revealed a *CARD11* driver mutation. An *ATM* A1159T gene mutation was found in recurrent focal tissue, potentially associated with tumor recurrence.
