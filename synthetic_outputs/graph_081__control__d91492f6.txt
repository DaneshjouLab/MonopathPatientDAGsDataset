A 46-year-old healthy woman with no significant medical history was incidentally found to have a 1.3-cm pulmonary nodule in the left anterior basal segment during a routine health examination. Initial CT imaging raised suspicions of T1a lung cancer. Subsequent endobronchial ultrasound transbronchial lung biopsy and transbronchial lung cryobiopsy revealed granulomatous inflammation. Tests for tuberculosis and NTM, including acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear, mycobacterial culture, and PCR for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and NTM, were negative. Following the biopsies, chest X-rays showed an enlarged shadow at the lesion, suggesting necrosis after cryobiopsy. The patient was treated with moxifloxacin, leading to symptom improvement. A final diagnosis of NTM infection, specifically Mycobacterium avium, was confirmed from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained three weeks after the tissue biopsy. Remarkably, at four months post-biopsy, a chest CT scan showed complete resolution of the nodule without additional antimicrobial therapy, suggesting a potential therapeutic effect of cryobiopsy-induced cryoablation.
