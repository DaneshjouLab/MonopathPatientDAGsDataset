A 65-year-old man with lung cancer underwent a right lower lobectomy with systemic lymph node dissection after induction chemotherapy with bevacizumab. Pathological examination revealed no residual tumor cells in the resected specimen. On postoperative day 26, the patient presented with severe dyspnea. Bronchoscopy revealed a bronchopleural fistula in the membranous portion of the right intermediate bronchus; the bronchial stump remained intact. The bronchopleural fistula was repaired with muscle flaps, and bronchoscopy 9 months after surgery showed satisfactory healing of the fistula. The patient has been alive for 5 years without evidence of recurrence. A bronchopleural fistula in the membranous portion of the right intermediate bronchus developed after right lower lobectomy following induction chemotherapy with bevacizumab in a patient with c-stage IIIA lung adenocarcinoma.
