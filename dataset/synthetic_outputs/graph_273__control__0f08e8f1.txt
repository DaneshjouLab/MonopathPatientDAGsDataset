A 75-year-old woman with stage IVB (cT2bN3M1b) lung adenocarcinoma was administered nivolumab, ipilimumab, carboplatin, and paclitaxel. Fourteen days after the first dose of chemotherapy, the patient presented with an impaired consciousness (Glasgow Coma Scale: E4V3M6) and a body temperature of 38.2Â°C. A physical neurological examination revealed no significant findings, except for motor aphasia. Therefore, the patient was diagnosed with encephalitis, possibly induced by nivolumab and ipilimumab, and treated with 1,000 mg of methylprednisolone for three days. After this intervention, the manifestations associated with meningoencephalitis did not recur. Meningoencephalitis was histologically confirmed during the autopsy, and mild inflammation with a mixture of macrophages and neutrophils was observed at several locations in the meninges. CD8<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes infiltrated the blood vessels in the brain. Metastasis was observed in all organs, except for the ovaries. Autopsy-confirmed encephalitis and CD8<sup>+</sup> lymphocyte infiltration around the blood vessels suggest that the pathogenesis in this case was consistent with encephalitis due to the irAEs of nivolumab and ipilimumab. Early detection and intervention led to a rapid improvement and the disappearance of the symptoms.
