A 70-year-old male, a current smoker with a history of alcohol consumption and poor oral hygiene, was admitted with recurrent cough and sputum, with an aggravation of symptoms over the preceding week. A chest CT scan revealed a 35x24 mm area of lung consolidation in the lower part of the right hilus. A contrast-enhanced scan showed significant enhancement with a slightly less enhanced mass shadow inside, along with right pleural effusion. Several enlarged lymph nodes were also observed in the mediastinum and right lung hilus.

The patient was initially treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, but subsequent chest CT scans showed progression of the lung lesions. Consequently, an ultrasound-guided lung biopsy and bronchoaspirate were performed. Pathology tests of the right lower lung lesion showed necrotic material with bacterial masses and what appeared to be "sulfur particles," numerous neutrophil exudates, and foci of epithelioid cells. Staining results were acid-fast negative, Gram positive, GMS positive, and PAS positive. Microbiological examination of the bronchoaspirate revealed colonies of microorganisms morphologically corresponding to actinomyces within purulent masses, with sulfur particles.

Based on these findings, a diagnosis of actinomycosis was made, and treatment was initiated with penicillin G at a dose of 720 units/day for 2 months. Following intravenous antibiotic treatment, the patient's cough and sputum subsided, and the well-
