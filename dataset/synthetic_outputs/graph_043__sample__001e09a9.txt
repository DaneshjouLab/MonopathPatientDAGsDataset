In August 2023, a 45-year-old female presented with metastatic lung cancer and a family history positive for malignancy (mother suffered from lung and cervical cancer). In July 2023, prior to diagnosis, the patient experienced frequent headaches, forgetfulness, and uncontrollable hand tremors. The patient has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status of 1 (ECOG PS 1). The patient has a 25-year smoking history, averaging 20 cigarettes a day, without comorbidities. MRI of the endocranium (07/23) showed an expansive frontal lesion in diameter of 3.9 × 3.4 × 3.8 cm, bordered by extensive perifocal vasogenic edema with a compressive effect on the surrounding brain parenchyma, and a smaller cerebellar lesion on the left hemisphere of the brain. MSCT of the chest (08/23) revealed a 28 × 31 × 29 mm spiculated tumor in the left upper lobe, located posteriorly along the aorta, left a pulmonalis, and along the incision. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy was present, with the largest lymph node measuring approximately 25 × 16 mm. The tumor was staged as T4N2M1, clinical stage 4. The patient underwent surgery for a tumor in the frontal region of the left hemisphere of the brain. The cerebellar tumor was treated with X-knife radiosurgery. Pathohistological analysis of brain metastasis revealed primary lung adenocarcinoma. Molecular testing showed PD-L1 TPS 55%, ALK expression absent, EGFR wild type. Pembrolizumab treatment was initiated due to PD-L1 expression > 50%. In October 2023, follow-up MSCT of the chest and abdomen (10/23) showed the first immune unconfirmed progressive disease (iUPD) in the upper left lobe, with the tumor measuring 32 × 68 × 70 mm. Lymph Nodes (LNs) conglomerate from group 4L and 5 measured 37 × 45 × 40 mm. Pericardial effusion was 14 mm. Endocranial MRI (10/23) showed stable disease (SD).
