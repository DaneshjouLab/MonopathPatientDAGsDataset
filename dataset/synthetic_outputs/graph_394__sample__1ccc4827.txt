An 8-year-old female Labrador Retriever dog presented with a 2-day history of lethargy and disorientation. The patient's condition deteriorated rapidly, and she experienced spontaneous cardiorespiratory arrest and died. A post-mortem examination was performed to determine the cause of death. Gross anatomic changes observed during autopsy included multiple soft white nodules (1–10 mm diameter) in the renal cortex and corticomedullary junction of both kidneys, left cardiac ventricular wall, and right cerebral hemisphere at the level of the basal nuclei. A left midline shift of the brain was noted due to compression by a neoplasm. An extensive, pale-white to yellow, irregular, firm mass effaced and expanded 80% of the right pulmonary parenchyma, involving mainly the cranial and middle lung lobes. Adjacent tracheobronchial lymph nodes were enlarged and firm. Histopathologic examination of kidney tissue revealed a well-demarcated, white to pale-yellow nodule expanding the cortex and corticomedullary junction of the left kidney. The neoplasm consisted of interlacing bundles of stellate-to-spindle cells with a moderate amount of eosinophilic, often-vacuolated cytoplasm with indistinct cell borders. Histopathologic examination of brain and cardiac tissues revealed a well-demarcated, white to dark-red nodule expanding the right basal nuclei. Nuclei were round-to-oval and had finely stippled chromatin with 1 or 2 nucleoli. Anisocytosis and anisokaryosis were moderate, and the mitotic count was 28 per 2.37 mm2. Alcian blue (AB) staining of sections of kidney and brain revealed a faintly basophilic myxomatous matrix throughout the neoplasm. Histopathologic examination of lung tissue revealed multiple infiltrative nodules composed of epithelial cells forming papillary projections supported by a fine fibrovascular stroma. Nuclei were round and had coarsely stippled chromatin with no distinct nucleolus. There were 5 mitoses per 2.37 mm2. Areas of necrosis were distributed throughout the neoplasm. A similar neoplasm partially effaced the nodal architecture of the tracheobronchial lymph nodes.
