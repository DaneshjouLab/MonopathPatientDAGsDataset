The patient initially commenced treatment with crizotinib, where they showed a positive response, achieving complete metabolic remission. A year later, the patient underwent a 18F-FDG PET/CT scan for the evaluation of disease reoccurrence due to the development of abdominal symptoms. 18F-FDG PET/CT showed ascites in the abdomen and pelvis with heterogenous low-grade FDG uptake and fat stranding, raising the possibility of peritoneal metastatic disease. There was a new large, intensely FDG-avid irregularly shaped soft tissue mass between the rectum and urinary bladder in keeping with a large peritoneal deposit. Biopsy confirmed Peritoneal Carcinomatosis (PC). The patient changed to a 3rd line regimen which consisted of Carboplatin (AUC5), pemetrexed, atezolizumab, bevacizumab. Three months later 18F-FDG PET/CT showed excellent response with complete metabolic remission and no evidence of residual or new FDG-avid malignant or metastatic disease. Treatment was changed to Lorlatinib. Post-treatment 18F-FDG PET/CT showed complete metabolic resolution of the ascites and peritoneal disease. No FDG-avid local lung recurrence or other metastasis indicated complete metabolic remission. Nine months later the patient developed recurrent significant abdominal bloating and pain. The patient underwent a 18F-FDG PET/CT scan, which showed findings consistent with recurrent peritoneal disease.
