A patient with unresectable stage III squamous cell lung carcinoma developed immune-related adverse events (irAEs) in the gastrointestinal tract following the administration of immune checkpoint inhibitors. The main irAEs include endocrinopathies, hepatitis, interstitial pneumonia, skin lesions, mucosal inflammation, diarrhea, and colitis. The patient subsequently developed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pneumonia and cytomegalovirus gastritis during immunosuppressive therapy for an immune-related adverse event. Cytomegalovirus infection was managed with the administration of ganciclovir.
