A 67-year-old woman presented to the Pulmonary Disease Department on September 16, 2020, with cough and phlegm, which had started 5 days prior to admission. Upon arrival, the patient experienced limb weakness. Her condition worsened with chest pain, difficulty breathing, frequent coughing, and phlegm accumulation. Initial vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 112/80 mmHg, a pulse rate of 125 beats per minute, a breathing rate of 60 breaths per minute, and a body temperature of 38.1 Â°C. The patient exhibited flushed cheeks, turbulent nostrils, and rapid breathing.

Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on patient tissues, showing thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), Napsin A, cytokeratin 5/6, P40, and AE1AE3, leading to a preliminary determination of lung adenocarcinoma. On September 17, 2020, a chest CT plain scan revealed bronchial lesions with infectious lesions in both lungs, especially in the upper lobe of the right lung. A larger shadow was observed in the right lung hilum, along with enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum and pleural effusion on the right side. A complete chest CT enhancement on the same day showed a right lung hilum mass, right lung obstructive pneumonia, enlarged lymph nodes in the hilum and mediastinum, and right pleural effusion.

Bronchoscopy was performed on September 17, 2020, followed by histopathological examination (Z202004957) which showed poorly differentiated carcinoma (right upper lobe bronchoscopy biopsy). Genetic testing (FZ20200424) revealed an EGFR exon 19-del mutation.

The patient was diagnosed with advanced lung adenocarcinoma with EGFR exon 19-del mutation. On September 25, 2020, targeted therapy with gefitinib (Yiruisha) 250 mg/d was initiated, resulting in progression-free survival (PFS) of 16 months.
