A patient presented with a complex pulmonary condition requiring multiple diagnostic procedures. Initial investigations included Endobronchial Ultrasound-guided Transbronchial Needle Aspiration (EBUS TBNA) and cryobiopsy. EBUS TBNA revealed the presence of lymphoma cells, raising suspicion for lymphoproliferative disorders. Further analysis from EBUS TBNA indicated the presence of non-small cell lung cancer, squamous cell lung cancer, and small cell lung cancer. Cryobiopsy samples showed diffuse large B cell lymphoma, sarcoidosis, and squamous cell lung cancer. Neoplastic cells were identified in both cryobiopsy and EBUS TBNA samples. Given the multiple diagnoses, the patient's case required careful consideration to determine the primary malignancy and appropriate treatment strategy. The timeline of diagnoses suggests a rapid progression or concurrent presentation of multiple conditions. The patient's demographics, specific treatments, and outcomes are not available from the provided data.
