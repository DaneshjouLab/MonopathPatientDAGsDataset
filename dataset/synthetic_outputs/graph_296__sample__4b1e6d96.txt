A 53-year-old male with a 30 pack year smoking history presented with 3 months of right hip pain. Physical examination revealed a 0.5 cm * 0.5 cm enlargement of his right supraclavicular lymph node, and tenderness in his right groin. Blood routine, liver and kidney function, and coagulation function were normal, except for a fibrinogen level of 4.68 g/l (Ref int 2.00–4.00 g/l). Tumor markers showed elevated CEA at 14.60 ng/ml (Ref int 0–5) and NSE at 33.03 ng/ml (Ref int 0–16.3), while CA199 was 3.10 U/ml (Ref int 0–35.00). The right supraclavicular lymph node was surrounded by vessels, making biopsy impossible. CT indicated malignant lesions of the left upper lobe and multiple lymph node metastases in the mediastinum, neck, both lungs, and right acetabular bone. PET-CT indicated lung cancer with dissemination to both lungs and pleural effusion on the left side. FDG metabolism of the left adrenal gland was slightly elevated. Multiple cysts were noticed in the liver and the left kidney. Ultrasound indicated multiple lymph node enlargement in bilateral supraclavicular regions. A clinical diagnosis of multiple metastasis of lung cancer was made after the family refused needle biopsy of lung lesions. The patient received palliative radiotherapy 2.5Gy/Fx on metastasis at the right acetabular bone, combined with zoledronic acid treatment and pain management. Central catheters were inserted peripherally and chemotherapy with Taxol 210 was initiated.
