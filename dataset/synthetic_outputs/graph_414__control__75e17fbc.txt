A 64-year-old man presented with cough of 6 months’ duration associated with shortness of breath over the last 2 months. He had presented to an outside hospital a month earlier, where after a chest skiagram and CT of the chest were taken, he was diagnosed to have a left lung mass. He proceeded with a CT-guided biopsy of the lung mass which on histopathology revealed necrotic material.

On presentation, the patient had a respiratory rate of 18 per minute, and impaired percussion note along with decreased intensity of breath sounds over the left upper hemithorax. He also presented with non-productive cough and dyspnoea and was evaluated and diagnosed to have a left lung mass on CT of the chest.

A transthoracic needle biopsy under CT guidance revealed necrotic tissue on histopathology and was inconclusive. Positron emission tomography scan revealed a fluoro-deoxyglucose-avid left lung mass with a left upper lobe luminal cut-off. The PET-CT revealed a fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG)-avid left lingular lung mass measuring 89×88×71 mL with maximum standardised uptake value (SUVmax) of 14.35, and an FDG avid intraluminal plug (SUVmax 8.13) within the left upper lobe bronchus, with enlarged FDG avid subcarinal lymph node and complete lingular collapse.

A flexible video bronchoscopy was performed and revealed left upper lobe complete obstruction with an endoluminal plug which was removed in piecemeal fashion, and deeper biopsies were taken from the lingula. Histopathology revealed underlying adenocarcinoma colonised by aspergillosis.
