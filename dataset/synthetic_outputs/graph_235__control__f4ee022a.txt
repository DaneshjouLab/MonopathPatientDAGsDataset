A 64-year-old man was referred to the hospital because of cough and chest X-ray findings with right pleural effusion and a right hilar mass. Significant facial edema was observed, and chest computed tomography (CT) showed superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. Right pneumothorax was observed on the 4th day, and chest tube drainage was initiated. Ampicillin/sulbactam was empirically administered on the 6th day since fever and right thoracic empyema developed. However, febrile neutropenia (159·μL<sup>−1</sup>) developed on the 8th day, and treatment was empirically changed to meropenem with filgrastim. Although pleural effusion culture showed a meropenem-sensitive peptostreptococcus infection, the patient’s condition did not improve, and diarrhea appeared on the 19th day. Bloody stools and abdominal pain developed on the 24th day. Abdominal CT showed a small amount of ascites, intestinal retention, intussusception in the ileocecal region, and abscess in the left hepatic lobe. Because diarrhea, abdominal pain, and bloody stool were observed, abdominal computed tomography was performed, showing intussusception, and extensive colectomy and colostomy were performed. Histopathology of the colon revealed gastrointestinal necrosis and perforation due to Entamoeba histolytica infection. Febrile neutropenia and grade 4 neutropenia developed. Amoebiasis improved after treatment with metronidazole and paromomycin.
