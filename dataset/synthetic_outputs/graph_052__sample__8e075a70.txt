A 61-year-old male with a history of intermittent cough for over two years, worsening in the last month, presented for evaluation. His medical history included pneumonia caused by *Legionella pneumophila*, hypertension, severe anemia, smoking, alcohol use, and blood transfusions.

One month prior to presentation, bronchoscopy and alveolar lavage fluid metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) analysis performed at an outside facility revealed a *Pasteurella pneumotropica* infection. The patient received anti-infective treatment for over two weeks, but showed no improvement.

Upon presentation, physical examination revealed a palpable lump on the right thoracic wall, accompanied by localized pain. Auscultation of both lungs revealed coarse breath sounds. Laboratory findings included a white blood cell count of 10.80x10^9/L (normal range: 3.5-9.5x10^9/L), red blood cell count of 3.75x10^12/L (normal range: 4.3-5.8x10^12/L), neutrophil count of 8.40x10^9/L (normal range: 1.8-6.3x10^9/L), hemoglobin of 104g/L (normal range: 130-175g/L), total protein of 85.80g/L (normal range: 65-85g/L), albumin of 39.00g/L (normal range: 40-55g/L), globulin of 46.80g/L (normal range: 20-40g/L), glucose of 9.43mmol/L (normal range: 3.9-6.1mmol/L), C-reactive protein of 119.69mg/L (normal range: 0-6mg/L), and squamous cell carcinoma antigen of 3.7ng/mL (normal range: 0-2.7ng/mL).

Antibody tests for HIV, HBV, HCV, EBV, and *Treponema pallidum* (TP) were negative. T-SPOT.TB assay, TB-DNA testing, G test, lower respiratory tract sputum culture, and bronchial lavage fluid culture showed no abnormalities. An enhanced CT scan revealed a new mass in the left lower lung, multiple enlarged lymph nodes, and bone destruction in the right tenth rib. Lung cancer with metastasis was suspected. Bronchoscopy did not reveal any tumor cells.
