A 79-year-old female with a remote history of smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obesity, long-standing gastroesophageal reflux disease, and a prior hysterectomy presented in 2017 for evaluation of a left upper lobe primary lung cancer, undergoing chest computed tomography (CT) for dry cough and dyspnea, which revealed a 1.7-cm left upper lobe lung nodule. In 2018 and 2019, follow-up interval CT scans demonstrated steady nodule growth. In August 2020, a CT scan showed that the left upper lobe pulmonary nodule had grown in size from 1.7 cm to 3.2 cm. A PET/CT scan demonstrated hypermetabolism in the left lung nodule, with maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of 10.2 g/mL, but without any associated adenopathy or distant disease. Navigational bronchoscopy with needle biopsies confirmed a left upper lobe non-small-cell carcinoma consistent with adenocarcinoma that had a clinical stage of cT2N0M0, cStage Ib. A CT scan revealed a paraesophageal hernia. In September 2020, the patient underwent an uneventful robot-assisted left upper lobectomy, with complete mediastinal lymph node dissection, using the daVinci® Xi™ robotic surgical platform. Operation lasted 10.
