A 33-year-old male presented with a cough. A chest CT revealed a mass in the upper left lung and enlargement of mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes. Subsequent PET/CT showed no distant metastasis. The patient underwent thoracoscopic radical resection of tumor tissue in the left upper lung and mediastinal lymph node dissection of the pulmonary hilum. Histopathological examination led to a diagnosis of Stage IIB (T2N1M0) adenosquamous carcinoma. Genetic testing of a tumor tissue sample identified an S768_D770dup mutation. Following surgery, the patient received adjuvant treatment consisting of 4 cycles of albumin-bound paclitaxel and cisplatin. A subsequent CT scan showed no recurrence or metastasis. However, a later PET/CT scan revealed progressive disease in bilateral lungs and bone metastasis. Follow-up CT scans continued to show progressive disease in bilateral lungs.
