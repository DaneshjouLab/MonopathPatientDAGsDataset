A 65-year-old male with known metastatic lung cancer presented to the emergency department with prolonged angina pectoris lasting approximately 8 hours. The patient had no prior history of chest pain or coronary artery disease, but had a history of hypertension and former smoking. On admission, he was hemodynamically stable without signs of cardiac decompensation. Elevated troponin and creatine kinase levels prompted emergency catheterization, which revealed a total occlusion of the distal left coronary artery attributed to tumour infiltration. Intervention attempts were unsuccessful, and given the palliative context, other revascularization strategies were not pursued. A two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiogram depicted tumour invasion at the heartâ€™s apex, confirming the diagnosis. The patient passed away shortly after receiving palliative radiation therapy.
