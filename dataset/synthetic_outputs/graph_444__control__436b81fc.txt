**Clinical Case Report: Tracheobronchitis and Laryngitis Associated with Crohn's Disease**

A 68-year-old woman with a history of Crohn's disease (CD) was referred to our hospital due to a one-month history of right-sided back pain. The patient denied experiencing pharyngeal pain, hoarseness, cough, sputum production, wheezing, or dyspnea. She had a smoking history of 22 pack-years.

Nine years prior to this presentation, the patient had been diagnosed with CD based on clinical, endoscopic, and histological evidence. Over the past several years, she had experienced two recurrent episodes of CD. During the second recurrence, colonoscopy revealed discontinuous mucosal ulceration in the transverse colon, sigmoid colon, and rectum. A "cobblestone" appearance was observed in the sigmoid colon. Pathological findings from the colonic specimen revealed a micro-abscess and cryptitis, supporting the diagnosis of CD. Since then, she had been managed with nutritional therapy, mesalazine (4000 mg/day), and adalimumab (80mg every 2 weeks), resulting in well-controlled gastrointestinal conditions for the previous 3 years.

Physical examination revealed a body temperature of 36.6 Â°C, and auscultation did not reveal any crackles. There were no cutaneous eruptions, and neurological examinations were negative.

Computed tomography (CT) of the chest demonstrated subpleural nodular consolidation (40 mm in diameter) invading the chest wall, along with two additional nodules (6mm and 8mm in diameter, respectively) in the right upper lobe. A cavitary nodule (21mm in diameter) was also noted in the left lower lobe. These findings raised suspicion for lung cancer.

During the evaluation for suspected lung cancer, bronchoscopy revealed swelling of the epiglottis with edematous changes and a mass-like epiglottis fold. Nodular and edematous changes were also observed in the trachea and bilateral main bronchus. Histological findings from these areas demonstrated infiltration by numerous lymphocytes and plasma cells, indicating tracheobronchitis and laryngitis. Notably, the patient had no symptoms related to these upper airway diseases (UADs).

Dexamethasone, administered as premedication for chemotherapy against lung cancer, proved efficacious in treating these extraintestinal manifestations of CD. This case is unique due to the concomitant appearance of bronchial lesions and UADs in a patient with well-controlled CD.
