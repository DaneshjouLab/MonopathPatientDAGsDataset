A patient presented with chronic headaches, progressing diplopia, and loss of sensation in the left side of the body. Examination revealed right cranial nerve III paresis, manifesting as a dropping right eyelid, and bitemporal hemianopsia. The patient also exhibited left hemiparesis, with numbness in the left side of the body, and their mouth was tilted to the right side.

Further investigation revealed diabetes insipidus and multiple intracranial masses, ultimately diagnosed as multiple intracranial metastases. The primary source was identified as lung adenocarcinoma. Serum cancer antigen (CA) 125 was elevated at 81.0 U/mL, and serum carcinoembryonic antigen was 41.06 ng/mL.

The patient underwent tumor removal. Pathology confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma, consistent with lung adenocarcinoma. Further imaging revealed multiple dural metastases and metastatic lesions to the sellar area. The differential diagnosis included multiple meningiomas, but the metastatic nature of the lesions was confirmed. The patient was also found to have breast cancer and lung cancer.
