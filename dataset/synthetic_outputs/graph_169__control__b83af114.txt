A 41-year-old female presented with a complex medical history. Three years prior to admission, she complained of repeated dyspnea and was diagnosed with pneumothorax, which was relieved after a thoracoscopic bullectomy. Two years prior to admission, the pneumothorax recurred, and thoracoscopy revealed pleural masses distributed along the mediastinum, transverse diaphragm, and lateral chest wall, which were subsequently removed. Pathological examination of these masses showed epithelioid mesothelioma. The patient then underwent a right open pleurectomy with argon employed for thoracic cavity lavage. Thoracic perfusion chemotherapy was not performed due to communication of the bilateral thoracic cavity. She subsequently received four cycles of chemotherapy (cisplatin and pemetrexed). One year before admission, a chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a 7 mm solid nodule beside the horizontal fissure at the right lung, and the patient received two cycles of chemotherapy (carboplatin and pemetrexed). Six months before admission, a right chest wall mass with poor mobility was detected. An FDG-PET/CT scan showed the right chest wall mass with a blurred boundary, measuring 8.9 cm Ã— 3.7 cm with a maximum SUV of 3.3. The pleura adjacent to the right-posterior mediastinum had become thickened and filled with encapsulated effusion with a maximum SUV of 27. The patient presented with a 6-month history of this chest wall mass being detected after the resection of the right pleural mesothelioma 2 years previously.
