The patient's case begins in December 2017 when a chest CT revealed a tumor in the left lung (S1/2) with pleural metastases. In January 2018, a fibrobronchoscopy with biopsy confirmed a poorly differentiated (G3) non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma, EGFR (-). From February to June 2018, the patient underwent six courses of chemotherapy treatment consisting of Carboplatin, Paclitaxel, and Bevacizumab. A chest CT in September 2018 showed a 16% reduction of target tumors, indicating stable oncologic disease. However, a chest CT in January 2019 revealed progression of the disease.

In December 2020, the patient began experiencing gastrointestinal symptoms. Nivolumab treatment was initiated in January 2021. In February 2021, an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with biopsy showed tumor-like endoscopic changes in the stomach. Histology revealed chronic active (++) erosive gastritis with gland destruction and lymphoepithelial infiltration, suggestive of possible immune check-point inhibitor therapy-associated gastritis. An abdominal CT in March 2021 showed stomach changes related to chronic gastritis. A repeat EGD with biopsy in March 2021 showed progression of tumor-like endoscopic changes in the stomach; histology revealed chronic active (++) gastritis with erosions and intestinal metaplasia. From March to April 2021, the patient received a first course of 20 mg/d of omeprazole.
