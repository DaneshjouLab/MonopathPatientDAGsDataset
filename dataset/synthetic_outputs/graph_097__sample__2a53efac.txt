A 67-year-old Japanese man was diagnosed with locally advanced squamous cell lung cancer. He received radical radiotherapy with concurrent carboplatin and paclitaxel followed by durvalumab. As a result of the treatment, the patient developed radiation pneumonitis, for which he received steroid treatment. Subsequently, the patient experienced a cough that worsened after drinking liquids. A chest X-ray revealed a cavity formation in the mediastinum shadow. A chest CT scan showed a cavity in the right lower lobe, at the original location of the lung cancer, communicating with the bronchus intermedius. A broncho-oesophageal fistula was diagnosed via oesophagography. Axial CT showed a 4 cm cavitary lung lesion. The patient received an oesophageal stent for the broncho-oesophageal fistula. The patient died of massive hemoptysis. Pathological autopsy confirmed the cavity as the origin of bleeding.
