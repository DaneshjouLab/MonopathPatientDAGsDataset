A patient presented with bronchitis-like symptoms, including cough and sputum production, accompanied by a low-grade fever and malaise, indicative of systemic and respiratory symptoms. The patient also reported epigastric abdominal pain and had a history of hypertension. Initial investigations revealed a solitary pulmonary nodule. A CT scan of the chest confirmed the presence of the pulmonary nodule, and a CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed. Further imaging revealed hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy. A positron emission tomography (PET) scan showed a hypermetabolic RML lung nodule and hypermetabolic intrathoracic lymph nodes, raising concerns about potential extrathoracic disease. To determine the nature of the nodule, a CT-guided core needle biopsy was performed. Histopathological analysis revealed the presence of a parasite, lymphocytic infiltration, disruption of the endothelial layer, and perivascular granulomatous inflammation. Further serological assay revealed a filaria IgG4 antibody. Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with human pulmonary dirofilariasis (HPD), a zoonotic disease. The pulmonary nodule was identified as involving a pulmonary artery branch.
