Lung large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (L-LCNEC) is a subtype of lung cancer with a low incidence and a high degree of malignancy. It is also a type of neuroendocrine tumor (NET) and is defined as a non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It accounts for less than 3% of all lung malignancies. It is characterized by invasion, extensive metastasis, and a low survival rate, and its clinical characteristics and prognosis are similar to those of small cell lung cancer (SCLC). A large number of gene mutations have been shown to drive the malignant transformation and cell proliferation of a range of human cancer types, including pulmonary cancer. L-LCNEC with the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene mutation is very rare and currently has no standard therapy. For early stage patients, surgical treatment is limited, and the risk of postoperative recurrence is high. For patients with unresectable or advanced disease, platinum-based chemotherapy is currently the mainstay of treatment, but its efficacy is unsatisfactory.

This article reports the case of a locally advanced L-LCNEC patient with ALK mutations who underwent first-line treatment with alectinib. The patient refused chemotherapy and received first-line treatment with alectinib 600 mg twice daily. After taking alectinib for 1 month, the patient’s chest enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan showed a partial response (PR). After 12 months of treatment with alectinib, a radiological evaluation showed that the patient had maintained the PR. A grade 2–3 rash was observed at the beginning of the treatment. After symptomatic treatment, the rash disappeared, and the side effects were fully tolerated. This case suggests that the first-line use of targeted therapy is also a good choice for L-LCNEC patients of stage III with gene mutations.
