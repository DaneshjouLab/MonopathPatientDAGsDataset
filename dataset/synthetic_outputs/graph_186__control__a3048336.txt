Patients with connective tissue diseases, such as dermatomyositis (DM), and positive anti-TIF1γ self-antibodies are commonly diagnosed with malignant tumors as a comorbidity. The relationship between anti-TIF1γ self-antibodies and existing malignant tumors has been confirmed by several reports. However, interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF) cases with a positive anti-TIF1γ self-antibody developing to solid malignant tumors are rarely reported.

This report describes a rare case of an IPAF patient with anti-TIF1γ self-antibodies who developed advanced lung squamous cell carcinoma in 1 year. The patient was initially diagnosed as an IPAF case with anti-TIF1γ self-antibody, and no evidence of malignant tumors was found at the initial visit. However, at the 1-year follow-up review, the patient had developed stage IVB lung squamous cell carcinoma.

DM patients with positive anti-TIF1γ self-antibodies are commonly diagnosed with malignant tumors as a comorbidity. This case highlights the importance of more frequent imaging examinations to identify the occurrence of malignant tumors as early as possible in IPAF patients with positive anti-TIF1γ self-antibodies. Recently, more and more rheumatologists and respiratory physicians start to pay more attention to the routine screening of solid tumors in DM patients with anti-TIF1γ self-antibody.
