A 71-year-old male with a history of stage 1 COPD and heavy smoking presented to the emergency room with a 2-week history of diffuse abdominal pain, without nausea, vomiting, GI transit disturbances, or changes in stool appearance. He also reported a 13 kg weight loss over the past year and a chronic nonproductive cough.

Physical examination revealed hypophonesis in the left upper pulmonary quadrant and acropachy in the upper extremities. Complete blood count and serum chemistry showed no abnormalities. A chest X-ray showed a paramediastinal mass in the left upper lobe with homogeneous density and regular edges. The patient was admitted for further evaluation.

During his admission, the patient's abdominal pain worsened, accompanied by bloating, vomiting, GI transit disturbances progressing to complete GI transit stoppage, and significant abdominal distention. Physical examination showed a distended, hyperresonant abdomen, without rebound tenderness or peritoneal irritation signs. A nasogastric tube was placed.

An emergency abdominal CT scan was performed to investigate the cause of the abdominal symptoms. The CT scan revealed a 7 cm lesion located in the posterior apical segment of the left upper lobe in a paramediastinal situation, in close contact with the superior margin of the oblique fissure, main left pulmonary artery, and left margin of the aortic arch (3 cm). The abdominal CT scan also revealed a 7 cm hypervascular lesion of neoplastic appearance in the ileocecal junction, along with adenopathies in the ileocolic, subcarinal, mediastinal, and pulmonary hilum territories.

Due to the ileocecal mass, an emergency right hemicolectomy was performed. Intraoperative findings included the ileocecal mass strongly adhered to the right parietocolic gutter, as well as several adenopathies along the ileocolonic axis, free abdominal fluid, and proximal distension of the small bowel.
