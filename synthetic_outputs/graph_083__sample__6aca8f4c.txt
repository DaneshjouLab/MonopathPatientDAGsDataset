A 67-year-old woman with a medical history of bipolar disorder, sleep apnea syndrome, and hypertension, and who was never a smoker, presented with suspicion of right pleural effusion on chest X-ray imaging and one month of persistent cough. Further investigation with chest CT revealed a 3.1 cm right lower lobe tumor, lymphadenopathy, right pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, and scattered nodules in bilateral breasts. Her CA19-9 level was 282 U/mL. Approximately 20 scattered tumor shadows, measuring up to 1.2 cm, were observed in both breasts. Molecular analysis of a transbronchial lung biopsy of the lung adenocarcinoma specimen using the Oncomine Dx Target Test (ODxTT) Multi-CDx System detected an EML4-ALK fusion gene. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining of the specimen revealed positivity for AE1/AE3, CAM5.2, E-cadherin, and thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) according to the IHC analysis. A needle biopsy of bilateral breast tumors was performed, and the histological findings on HE staining corresponded to adenocarcinoma derived from the lungs or breasts. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) of lung and bilateral breast specimens showed positivity for TTF-1 and E-cadherin, and negativity for ER, PgR, and HER2. ALK immunostaining was positive. FISH analysis detected ALK rearrangement with isolated red and green signals along with fused red/green signals. ALK copy number gain was noted in both specimens. Based on these findings, the bilateral breast tumors were diagnosed as metastases from lung adenocarcinoma. Oral treatment with alectinib (600 mg once a day) was initiated. With alectinib treatment, tumor sizes reduced to 1.2 cm, and the breast metastases nearly disappeared, shrinking to a maximum size of 4 mm. Chest CT findings at six months after alectinib treatment showed tumor size reduction in the lower right lobe and resolution of the pleural effusion. Follow-up CT imaging showed resolution of shadows in bilateral breasts. Lymphadenopathy, pleural effusions, and pericardial effusions decreased. The CA 19-9 level decreased to 3.7 U/mL. Alectinib therapy is ongoing, with no evidence of recurrence. The patient was diagnosed with ALK rearrangement-positive pulmonary adenocarcinoma with bilateral scattered breast metastases.
