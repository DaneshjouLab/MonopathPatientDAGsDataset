A 70-year-old patient with a history of asbestos exposure and a 20 pack-year smoking history was diagnosed in 2023 with large-cell squamous carcinoma of the left upper lobe with mediastinal lymph node metastases (cT4 cN3 cM0, stage IIIC). The patient was treated with curative intent with four cycles of vinorelbine/carboplatin, one cycle of durvalumab, and radiotherapy (total dose: 60 Gy). The patient was subsequently admitted for monitoring of bilateral radiation pneumonitis progression. A CT scan showed regression of the left central tumor, mediastinal, and right hilar lymph nodes, along with a trend toward resolution of bipulmonary pneumonitis. Bronchoscopy revealed marked tumor regression in the left upper lobe, with histology showing bronchial wall reserve cell hyperplasia and mucosal changes, but no recurrence of the previously diagnosed poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma or evidence of malignancy. However, a CT scan revealed a new lesion suspicious for malignancy in liver segments V and VI. MRI confirmed a well-defined mass in the right hepatic lobe, consistent with metastasis from the known squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. The pulmonary tumor board recommended surgical resection of the solitary centrally located hepatic metastasis.
