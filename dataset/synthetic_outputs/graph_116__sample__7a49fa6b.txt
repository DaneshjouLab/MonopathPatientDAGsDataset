A 62-year-old woman presented with an incidentally identified solitary pulmonary nodule in the lateral segment of the right middle lobe (RML) found on CT of the abdomen and pelvis for evaluation of epigastric abdominal pain. Her medical history was significant for hypertension. She reported bronchitis-like symptoms characterized by cough, sputum production, low-grade fever, and malaise several months prior, which resolved over a few weeks.

The patient denied systemic or respiratory symptoms. She was a never smoker and worked as an ophthalmology nurse practitioner. She had no history of tuberculosis (TB) or known exposure to patients with TB. She had never travelled outside the USA but lived in a Histoplasma endemic rural midwestern state.

Physical examination was normal. A CT scan of the chest demonstrated a mildly irregular, non-calcified 1.4 x 1.0 cm subpleural pulmonary nodule in the right middle lobe (RML). No hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy was noted. The patient had no pets at home.

A PET scan revealed a hypermetabolic RML lung nodule with a standard uptake value of 3.6. No hypermetabolic intrathoracic lymph nodes or evidence of extrathoracic disease were seen. Axial CT of the chest revealed a mildly irregular subpleural pulmonary nodule in the lateral segment of the right middle lobe with mild pleural thickening adjacent to the lesion.

A CT-guided core needle biopsy of the RML nodule was performed. Histopathology revealed a parasite with a thick multi-layered cuticular layer measuring 85 \u00b5m in cross-sectional diameter, lodged in a small pulmonary artery branch, with lymphocytic infiltration of the vessel and disruption of the endothelial layer. Histopathology showed perivascular granulomatous inflammation. The parasite with thick cuticular layer was suspected to be Dirofilaria immitis. Histopathology revealed parasitic morphologies consistent with Dirofilaria immitis, lymphocytic infiltrate of the disrupted vascular endothelium, areas of necrosis surrounding the lesion, and perivascular granulomatous inflammation.

Filaria IgG4 antibody measured by ELISA showed a high antibody level but still within equivocal range (IgG4 antibody 2.7, negative test <1.5, positive test >3).

The patient was diagnosed with human pulmonary dirofilariasis (HPD) and managed conservatively. Histopathological analysis of the core needle biopsy of the pulmonary nodule showed a parasite with thick multi-layered cuticle lodged in the small pulmonary artery branch. The parasite measured 85 \u00b5m in cross-sectional diameter and demonstrated advanced stages of decomposition. Degenerating muscular ridges were also seen.

Follow-up CT chest approximately 1 year after diagnosis revealed a reduction in the size (1.1 x 0.9 cm) and solidity of the RML lesion.
