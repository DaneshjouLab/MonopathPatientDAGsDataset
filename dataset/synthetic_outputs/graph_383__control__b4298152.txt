A patient developed debilitating myositis shortly after starting treatment with vemurafenib and cobimetinib. The myositis proved refractory to corticosteroids, necessitating hospitalization. Shortly thereafter, the myositis worsened, becoming refractory to corticosteroids, requiring therapeutic plasma exchange (PLEX) and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). Statin-induced autoimmune myopathy was considered given the patient's history of rosuvastatin use and necrotic muscle fibers on histopathology, although it is not commonly associated with infiltrating lymphocytes. This case represents the first report of steroid-refractory myositis in a patient receiving the combination of vemurafenib and cobimetinib, requiring PLEX and IVIG.
