An 8-year-old female Labrador Retriever dog presented with a 2-day history of lethargy and disorientation. The patient subsequently suffered cardiorespiratory arrest and died spontaneously. A post-mortem examination (autopsy) revealed a renal interstitial cell tumor (RICT) with cardiac and cerebral metastases, and a pulmonary carcinoma with tracheobronchial lymph node metastasis. Morphologic and immunohistochemical findings confirmed the diagnoses.
