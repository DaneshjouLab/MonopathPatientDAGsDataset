In April 2019, a 40-year-old man with a history of smoking presented with a 5-month history of aggravating and irritating dry cough. Percussion of the right upper lung showed a solid sound, and auscultation suggested that the right lung breath sound was weak. The patient had a history of ulna fracture surgery in 1999. Chest CT showed a 7.6 cm x 5.8 cm mass in the right lung with multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum. Brain MRI showed no significant space-occupying lesions. Percutaneous lung biopsy showed atypical cells. Immunohistochemical staining showed positive expression for TTF-1, CK 8/18, and CK7, and negative expression for CK5/6, Napsin A, and P40. Pathological findings of the lung biopsy established the diagnosis of lung low-differentiated adenocarcinoma. He was diagnosed with right lung adenocarcinoma (T3N2M0, IIIA). Hematoxylin and eosin staining showed a low differentiation adenocarcinoma (HE × 100). Next-generation sequencing (NGS) using a 1,021-gene panel revealed: SDC4-ROS1(EX2:EX32) rearrangement (mutant allele frequency 7.0%), ROS1-GK (EX31:EX13) rearrangement (mutant allele frequency 7.8%), NF1 c.7324C>T p.L2442F EX49 mutation (mutant allele frequency 7.6%), and ERBB4 c.1976G>T p.G659V mutation. In May 2019, the patient was treated with crizotinib 250 mg orally twice daily as first-line treatment. Additional genetic testing revealed: EPAS1 c.469A>G p.K157E EX5 4.6%, EX17 5.4%. Follow-up CT after 2 months of crizotinib treatment showed cough significantly improved and a partial response in the lung lesions (4.2 cm × 3.3 cm). Follow-up CT examinations at 5 and 7 months after treatment showed that the lung lesion was stable compared with previous examinations. In February 2020, the patient was admitted to the hospital for 1 month of progressively aggravated headache, dizziness, vomiting, and nausea. Brain MRI revealed an iso-signal shadow with a diameter of 0.8 cm and 2.1 cm in the right frontal lobe and parietal lobe, respectively, suggesting metastatic lesions in the brain.
