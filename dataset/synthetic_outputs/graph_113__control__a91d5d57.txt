A 74-year-old man was diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer-not otherwise specified (NSCLC-NOS), clinical stage T4N0M1c stage IVb. Blood testing showed leucocytosis and aberrant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) expression. Given the high PD-L1 expression in the tumors, single-agent pembrolizumab was chosen as the initial treatment. A clinically favorable response was achieved after seven courses of pembrolizumab, resulting in a total disease-free survival of 10 months. During this period, the blood leucocyte count was concordant with the disease condition. Pembrolizumab monotherapy proved effective as an initial treatment for this patient with NSCLC-NOS with high PD-L1 expression and aberrant G-CSF production.
