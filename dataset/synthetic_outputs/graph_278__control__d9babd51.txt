A female patient in her 40s presented with a one-month history of dyspnoea, chest pain, cough, fever, loss of appetite, and weight loss. She had no prior health conditions, no history of tuberculosis exposure, and was a non-smoker and non-substance abuser. She lived in a rural area with her husband and two children, and her living environment was free of asbestos.

Initial evaluation revealed an elevated heart rate, normal blood pressure, and a slightly increased breathing rate. Oxygen saturation was normal. There were no signs of anemia, clubbing, cyanosis, jaundice, or significant lymphadenopathy. Physical examination indicated a dull note on percussion and reduced breath-sound intensity in specific areas of her chest, suggesting right-sided pleural effusion.

The patient was initially treated elsewhere with thoracocentesis and antitubercular therapy based on findings in the pleural fluid. However, her condition did not improve. Pleural fluid analysis revealed low adenosine deaminase (ADA) and exudative pleural effusion. Ultimately, she was diagnosed with synchronous malignant pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma, despite lacking a history of asbestos exposure.
