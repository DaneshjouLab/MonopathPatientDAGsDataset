In 2019, a 72-year-old Japanese woman, a non-smoker with no specific medical history and an ECOG performance status of zero, presented with an abnormal chest opacity detected during an annual health checkup. A subsequent chest CT revealed a 2.5x1.6 cm pulmonary nodule in the left lower lobe. The patient underwent a left lower lobectomy and systemic lymph node dissection. Post-operative pathology revealed adenocarcinoma (pT2aN2M0 Stage IIIA) harboring an EGFR exon 18 G719X mutation. Following surgery, she received four cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin plus vinorelbine. The disease recurred with multiple intrapulmonary metastases and malignant pleural effusion. Genetic analysis of the pleural effusion confirmed the presence of the EGFR exon 18 G719X mutation. The patient was then treated with gefitinib for 15 months. During gefitinib treatment, increased pleural effusion and carcinomatous lymphangiomatosis were noted. Plasma analysis revealed the presence of both EGFR exon 18 G719X and exon 20 T790M mutations. The patient's ECOG performance status declined to 2 due to worsening dyspnea.
