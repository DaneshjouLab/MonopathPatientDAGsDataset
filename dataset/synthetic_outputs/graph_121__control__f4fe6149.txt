A 42-year-old female presented with a right lower lung mass with cavities. The mass was first identified on chest computed tomography (CT) in 2021. Over the course of one year, the mass persisted and subsequently enlarged despite chemotherapy and routine follow-up CT scans. A right lower lobectomy was then performed. Postoperative pathology confirmed the diagnosis of primary pulmonary lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma. After 10 months of follow-up, the patient was still alive and no recurrence was observed. Lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma of the lung is a rare primary malignancy of the lung, accounting for only 0.9% of primary malignancies of the lung. Those associated with cavities are even rarer, with fewer than five cases reported in the English literature.
