An 83-year-old man was admitted to the Respiratory Department of the Affiliated Kunshan Hospital of Jiangsu University on October 30, 2019, due to cough and expectoration accompanying hemoptysis for 1 week. The patient first took crizotinib. After taking crizotinib for 10 days, the patient developed mild nausea without vomiting. However, considering the intolerable hepatotoxicity, the patient switched to take alectinib 1200 mg BID from January 20, 2020, due to gastrointestinal AEs. After 1 week, the clinician reduced the dosage to 600 mg BID, but the patient still had swelling in his legs and felt fatigued. Although alectinib remained effective on tumors, ceritinib (450 mg) was replaced after the AEs of hyperbilirubinemia occurred. The total bilirubin of this patient reached up to three times of reference range. Reexamination of liver function revealed that the level of alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) was 3–4 times higher than baseline, suggesting mild liver function impairment. He suffered from diarrhea and antidiarrheal drugs were ineffective. After reducing the dose to 300mg, the diarrhea AEs caused by ceritinib were effectively relieved, and the patient obtained sustained clinical benefit with progression-free survival nearly 12 months. During treatment with dose reduction of ceritinib, the patient’s blood routine tests and liver function tests were normal, and chest CT scan demonstrated stable disease.
