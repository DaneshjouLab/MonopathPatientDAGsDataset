Case Report: A patient was diagnosed with stage IV (T3N0M1) lung adenocarcinoma via percutaneous biopsy. The patient had nonâ€“small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) driven by an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation, specifically a novel EGFR exon 20 insertion mutation D770_N771insGT and multiple brain metastases.

Initially, the patient was treated with first-line osimertinib. The patient briefly responded to this treatment. Due to disease progression, particularly in the brain metastases (BMs), a second-line treatment of osimertinib plus bevacizumab was initiated. This combination therapy resulted in prolonged disease control.

This case suggests that osimertinib in combination with bevacizumab may be an effective option for NSCLC patients with specific EGFRex20ins mutations and brain metastases. The VEGF pathway is a key mediator of cancer metastasis and resistance to EGFR TKIs, and the addition of anti-VEGF agents to EGFR TKIs provides an alternative treatment option for the clinical management of EGFR-mutant NSCLC.
