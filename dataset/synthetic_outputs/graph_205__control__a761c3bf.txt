A 62-year-old man was diagnosed with autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) 8 years prior to current admission. He was subsequently diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma in his right lung. He was treated with platinum-based chemotherapy, followed by the immune checkpoint inhibitor atezolizumab. He experienced disease progression after atezolizumab treatment. Notably, he did not experience ICI-induced pneumonia or exacerbation of PAP. This suggests that ICI may be safely used in patients with primary lung cancer with PAP.
