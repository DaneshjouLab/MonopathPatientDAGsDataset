A 75-year-old man with a 60-pack-year smoking history presented with nodules in the right lung. Bronchoscopy was performed to evaluate the nodules, and histopathological evaluation of biopsy specimens revealed invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma. Staging with PET/CT showed FDG uptake in the pulmonary nodules, hilar lymph nodes, and rod-shaped uptake in the right proximal femur. No brain metastases were detected. Further characterization of the femoral lesion with MRI showed a well-defined area of signal hypointensity on T1-weighted imaging and signal hyperintensity on T2-weighted imaging within the bone marrow, measuring 65 mm in length. CT showed no destruction of the femoral cortex. Biopsy of the femoral lesion showed the same characteristics as the lung carcinoma, leading to a diagnosis of intertrabecular metastasis (ITM) of the lung adenocarcinoma. The patient is currently receiving chemotherapy. Follow-up FDG-PET/CT shows uptake in the pulmonary nodules, hilar lymph nodes, and right femur, with rod-shaped uptake in the bone marrow.
