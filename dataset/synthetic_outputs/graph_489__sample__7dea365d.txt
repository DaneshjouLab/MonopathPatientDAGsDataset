A 71-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and cataracts underwent a right lower lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node dissection and was diagnosed with pathological T2aN0M0 stage IB lung adenocarcinoma. Approximately one year later, a CT scan revealed enlargement of the right hilar and multiple mediastinal lymph nodes. Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration of the mediastinal lymph node confirmed adenocarcinoma. Analysis of the primary lung tumor and recurrent mediastinal lymph node exhibited an exon21 L858R mutation by cobas®EGFR Mutation Test v2 and a PD-L1 tumor proportion score of ≥50% (evaluated using PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx KIT). The patient was diagnosed with postoperative local recurrence, and treatment with osimertinib (80 mg/day) was initiated due to her reluctance to undergo radiotherapy because of concerns about adverse events. Chest computed tomography showed enlargement of multiple mediastinal lymph nodes at postoperative recurrence. After administration of osimertinib, the #2R and #7 lymph nodes increased in size from 15 mm to 18 mm. Eight weeks after osimertinib initiation, significant enlargement of the right hilar and multiple mediastinal lymph nodes was observed, indicating disease progression. Pembrolizumab was then initiated at a dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks. After two cycles of pembrolizumab treatment, CT showed remarkable shrinkage of the mediastinal lymph nodes, and a complete response (CR) was achieved.
