A 69-year-old Caucasian gentleman with coronary artery disease status post 6-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting, obstructive sleep apnea, a 60-pack-year smoking history, and COPD on 2 L/hour of oxygen presented for LDCT screening. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) showed an FEV1of 1.83 L (75%), FVC of 2.85 L (85%), FEV1/FVC of 64, TLC of 6.02 L (128%), and DLCO of 12.7 mL/min/mmHg (94%). The LDCT showed a new spiculated 1.5 cm Ã— 1.0 cm solid nodule in the right upper lobe, and severe pan-lobar emphysema with minimal intervening normal lung parenchyma. Follow-up PET/CT showed isolated avidity in the right upper lobe nodule with an SUV of 5. Transthoracic needle aspiration of the right upper lobe nodule revealed invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. Prior to lung cancer treatment, the patient underwent cardiac workup. Echocardiogram showed LVEF 55%. Left heart catheterization showed severe native triple vessel disease and restenosis of the vein graft to LAD requiring drug-eluting stent placement. The patient was referred for stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) but was unable to withstand the mapping CTs needed for this, as well as MRI, due to severe rib fractures sustained secondary to sleepwalking and multiple falls due to non-compliance with CPAP for his OSA. The patient was too unsteady on his feet to perform exercise testing. The patient underwent radiofrequency ablation of the right upper lobe nodule. Post ablation, staging was T1N0M0 or stage IA2 adenocarcinoma of the lung. The patient is 6 years progression-free without recurrence and is still alive. Home medications include triple therapy with a long-acting muscarinic antagonist, a long-acting beta agonist, and an inhaled corticosteroid. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) showed an FEV1of 1.08 L (36%), FVC of 2.44 L (56%), FEV1/FVC ratio of 44, TLC of 8.63 L (136%), and DLCO of 15.6 mL/min/mmHg (92%). Results of the LDCT showed a new spiculated 1.7 cm nodule in the left lower lobe. PET/CT showed an isolated hypermetabolic lesion in the left lower lobe with a standardized uptake value (SUV) of 6.1 and uptake in the mediastinal lymph nodes.
