A 73-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with constitutional syndrome, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. She had a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, pancreatic cysts, and fibromyalgia, with no risk of exposure to pollutants. The patient had already undergone a pancreatic echo-endoscopy with a biopsy that documented a serous cyst. During her hospital stay, she was diagnosed with abdominal ascites. She also presented with an increase in abdominal pain, for which a computed tomography (CT) of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis was carried out, revealing peritoneal effusion with signs of peritoneal carcinomatosis, especially in the lesser omentum, and edema of the adnexa, suggesting secondary involvement. An abdominal ultrasound confirmed aspects suggestive of peritoneal carcinomatosis. The exam revealed hypermetabolic abdominal-pelvic adenopathies and extensive diffuse hypermetabolic peritoneal densifications with peritoneal effusion, suggestive aspects of peritoneal carcinomatosis.
