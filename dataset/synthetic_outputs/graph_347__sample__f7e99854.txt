A 3-year-old female presented with sudden onset of dyspnea, cough, and chest pain. The patient progressed from initial symptoms of dyspnea, cough, and chest pain to radiographic evidence of a large left pneumothorax with total lung collapse. Pneumothorax further characterized via CT scan, revealing encysted pneumothorax and a lung cyst. CT scan revealed encysted pneumothorax and partial lung collapse. A 2 cm lung cyst was identified in the left lower lobe. The lung cyst was resected and diagnosed as Pleuropulmonary Blastoma (PPB) type I. Histology revealed Pleuropulmonary Blastoma (PPB) type I. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed positivity to vimentin and SMA. Following resection of PPB type I, chemotherapy was initiated with vincristine, Adriamycin, and cyclophosphamide (VAC regimen).

Two years later, the patient presented with severe respiratory distress, hypotension, tachycardia, and elevated jugular venous pressure (obstructive shock). Obstructive shock further characterized by CXR showing total homogenous opacification of the entire left hemithorax with a significant mediastinal shift to the opposite side. Opacification further characterized by CT scan revealing a huge mediastinal mass in the left upper lung. The mediastinal mass was resected and diagnosed as Pleuropulmonary Blastoma (PPB) type II. Patient had a huge soft tissue mass (friable, highly vascular and had both cystic and solid components) in the left upper lung. Patient underwent left upper lobectomy. Histology revealed Pleuropulmonary Blastoma (PPB) type II. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed positivity to vimentin and SMA. Following resection of PPB type II, chemotherapy was initiated with vincristine, Adriamycin, and cyclophosphamide (VAC regimen).

Approximately 2 years post-operation, the patient experienced a recurrence, followed by 3 years of follow-up. Patient 3 (3 years old, Male) experienced a recurrence approximately 2 years post-operation, followed by 3 years of follow-up. The patient presented with low-grade fever, tachypnea, and tachycardia, with suspected empyema. Thoracostomy was performed, yielding only 100 ml of serosanguinous fluid. Chest X-ray (CXR) showed total opacification of the left hemithorax. Patient underwent wedge resection of a mass containing gelatinous material in the left lower lung. Histology revealed Pleuropulmonary Blastoma (PPB) type II. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed positivity to vimentin and SMA.
