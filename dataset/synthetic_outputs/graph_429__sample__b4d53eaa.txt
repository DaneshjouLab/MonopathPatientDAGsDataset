A 46-year-old man with a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia, diagnosed 4 months prior, presented with new-onset diabetes mellitus (DM) diagnosed 1 month prior, for which he was taking oral anti-diabetic drugs. He was referred to the emergency department for hypokalemia of 2.5 mEq/L (reference value: 3.5–5.1). He reported symptoms including paresthesias, weakness, anorexia, asthenia, and marked weight loss (about 10 kg) over the preceding month.

Ambulatory analysis raised suspicion of endogenous hypercortisolism [morning ACTH 146.0 ng/L (reference value: 9.0-52.0) and cortisol 44.5 ug/dL (reference value: 5.0-25.0)]. He also exhibited mild peripheral oedema. Consequently, he was admitted to the Endocrinology department for further investigation. Hormonal study revealed a midnight serum cortisol level of 36.2 ug/dL (reference value: <7.5), midnight salivary cortisol 4.2 ug/dL (reference value: <0.3) and 24 h-urinary free cortisol (UFC) 6210.0 ug/24 h (reference value: 36.0–137.0). The result of a 1 mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test was 42.6ug/dL (reference value: <1.8). His serum potassium level was 3.0 mEq/L (reference value: 3.5–5.1). A low-dose dexamethasone suppression test was performed, with a baseline cortisol level of 38.3 ug/dL at 8 a.m. The low-dose dexamethasone suppression test was compatible with Cushing's syndrome (CS), and a further high-dose dexamethasone suppression test showed no suppression of cortisol levels.
