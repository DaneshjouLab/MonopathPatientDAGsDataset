A 70-year-old male presented with a 2-month history of abdominal distension and pain. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen revealed an intraperitoneal mass measuring 17 \u00d7 13 cm, located in the mid-abdomen and extending into left lumbar region. The lesion extended posteriorly, encasing the 3rd part of the duodenum, abutting the abdominal aorta, and further extending into the left lumbar region. A trucut biopsy revealed a spindle cell neoplasm on histopathological examination. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining showed SMA+, S100 (patchy +), desmin+, CD34-, ALK-, and CD117-. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of low-grade myofibroblastic/smooth muscle neoplasm was made. Peritoneal fluid analysis revealed benign and reactive mesothelial cells with atypical epithelioid cells (coarse nuclear chromatin, prominent nucleoli, abundant cytoplasm). Cytology showed cells exhibiting binucleation and multinucleation. IHC staining of the cytology sample showed SMA+ and calretinin-. MDM2 IHC showed diffuse nuclear positivity. Cytology was reported as positive for malignancy, suggestive of metastatic deposits of dedifferentiated liposarcoma. A resection specimen revealed a large intraperitoneal mass measuring 18 \u00d7 17 cm with adhered intestinal loops. Histopathology showed a predominantly low-grade, spindle cell neoplasm with areas exhibiting high-grade features, characterized by cells with epithelioid morphology, enlarged nuclei, and multinucleation, consistent with findings from cytological evaluation. IHC staining of the resection specimen showed retained H3K27me3 expression, myogenin and myoD1 negativity, and diffuse MDM2 and p16 positivity. Based on these findings, a final diagnosis of dedifferentiated liposarcoma was made. The postoperative period was uneventful. The patient has been undergoing regular follow-up for the past 6 months with no specific complaints or evidence of relapse.
