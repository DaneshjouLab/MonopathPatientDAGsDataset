Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most prevalent histologic subtype of lung cancer and accounts for almost half of all lung cancer deaths because of its indolent clinical presentation and its peripheral location in the lung parenchyma. Despite rapid improvements in lung cancer prevention through smoking cessation and screening programmes, as well as targeted and multi-modality therapies in the last few decades, lung cancer remains a dreadful disease. While the incidence and mortality of many other types of lung cancer such as squamous cell lung carcinoma and small cell lung carcinoma are continuously dropping in more developed countries where smoking incidence is declining, LUAD incidence and mortality are constantly rising, a phenomenon ascribed to the changing face of manufactured cigarettes and the increasing occurrence of LUAD in nonsmokers. Such lung cancer initiating and stem cells possess self-renewal properties and are able to execute programmes of repair and normal tissue replacement during precarcinogenesis and established carcinogenesis. To this end, p63(+)Krt5(+) distal airway stem cells likely relevant to airway basal cells have been shown to maintain and repopulate the airway and alveolar epithelium following viral injury, while club cell secretory protein (CCSP)-expressing club cells have also been shown to be capable of maintaining and repairing smaller bronchioles and alveolar structures. Heredity can also indirectly cause cancer by influencing our interactions with the environment, as is the case with a single nucleotide polymorphism in the habenular nicotinergic acetylcholine receptor which renders individuals susceptible to nicotine addiction and thereby to COPD, lung cancer and peripheral arterial disease. Environmental carcinogens are thought to be even more important than heredity in precipitating chest tumours in humans. Radiation has also been tightly linked with lung cancer development based on a number of different data sources, including atom bomb survivors, nuclear plant workers, uranium miners, radiotherapy patients, and participants of lung cancer screening programmes. As a result, several mutant Kras/KRAS knock-in and Trp53 knockout mouse models have been generated, with the most widely used among them being the Lox
