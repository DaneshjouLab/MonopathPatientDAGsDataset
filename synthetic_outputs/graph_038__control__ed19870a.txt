A 70-year-old man with advanced squamous lung cancer developed dermatologic toxicities after receiving Pembrolizumab-based therapy. He presented with blisters and papules distributed covering 60% of the trunk and extremities, along with more than 90% coverage of the hands and feet, graded as a cutaneous immune-related adverse event (irAE) of 3â€“4 levels. The dermatologic toxicities were accompanied by pruritus, infections, hypercoagulation, hypoproteinemia, and electrolyte disturbance. During the acute phase, the patient was treated with an integrative treatment of intravenous glucocorticosteroids synchronized with traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) decoctions for seven days. This treatment effectively intercepted the appearance of fresh cutaneous lesions, with noticeable alleviation of pruritus and other complications. He then began to taper his glucocorticoid dosage with the assistance of TCM. Antihistamines and topicals were used in the first three weeks. As a result, the cutaneous symptoms were well controlled, and he was subsequently transferred for further anti-tumor therapies. The integrated glucocorticoids and TCM successfully brought the patient out of the acute phase of high-grade irAE dermatologic toxicity. The cutaneous symptoms were resolved more rapidly, with earlier glucocorticoid tapering and fewer adverse hormonal effects, without tumor progression.
