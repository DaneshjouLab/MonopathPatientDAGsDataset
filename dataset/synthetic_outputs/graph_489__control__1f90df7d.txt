A patient with EGFR mutation-positive lung adenocarcinoma experienced early progression within two months of osimertinib administration, a third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which is the standard first-line treatment for this condition. Following disease progression under osimertinib treatment, the patient refused cytotoxic chemotherapy. The patient then received pembrolizumab at a dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks. After two cycles of treatment, CT showed remarkable shrinkage of the mediastinal lymph nodes, and a complete response (CR) was achieved. However, pembrolizumab was discontinued after only two cycles because of the development of a severe skin rash (grade 3). Following treatment discontinuation, the skin disorder improved, and pembrolizumab was not resumed in accordance with the patientâ€™s preference.
