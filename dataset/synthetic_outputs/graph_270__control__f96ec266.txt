Concomitant coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is a major risk factor for complications in any type of surgical procedure, especially in thoracic surgery, were the primary organ involved, the lung, is manipulated to perform parenchymal resection. However, it is not clear whether previous infection from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may lead to increased morbidity and mortality for subsequent procedures once radiologic resolution is achieved. This case report describes a young patient with lung cancer who successfully underwent a right upper lobectomy for primary adenocarcinoma by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery with no complication in the early postoperative phase.

A 46-year-old man with a 40 pack-year smoking history presented to the emergency department with worsening dyspnea and fever. A chest roentgenogram showed diffuse bilateral opacities with peripheral distribution. A computed tomographic (CT) chest scan revealed peripheral bilateral ground-glass opacity (GGO) with crazy paving appearance plus a 40-mm nodule in the right upper lobe. A nasal swab tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and the diagnosis of COVID-19 was made.

The patient's condition was generally good, and intensive care was not required. He was discharged after 5 days. A repeated nasal swab at 16 days was negative. A positron emission tomography/CT after 30 days showed a standardized uptake value (SUV) of 9 for the nodule, with slight inflammatory uptake of hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes. Improvement of lung opacities was noted.

A CT-guided biopsy was offered, but the patient refused and preferred up-front operation. His medical history was positive for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Pulmonary function was within normal ranges, with forced expiratory volume in 1 second of 3.99 liters (102% of predicted value) and forced vital capacity of 4.98 liters (103%). Diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (Dlco) was preserved (99%).

Upon arrival for surgery, a repeat chest CT scan showed reduction of GGO, and a nasal swab was negative for SARS-CoV-2.

A standard right upper lobectomy with lymphadenectomy was performed with video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery after 45 days from the initial COVID-19 diagnosis. During the surgical procedure, adhesions between the lung and mediastinal structure were noted. The surgeon experienced some difficulty, describing tissues around the hilum as very firm and tough when cutting, with extremely enlarged lymph nodes. Operative time was 215 minutes with no blood loss. There were no complications in the postoperative period, and the patient was discharged after 3 days.

For comparison, length of stay and time to completion of the right upper lobectomy from the same surgeon were analyzed. No difference was present for length of stay, but time to completion was longer (152.5 vs 215 minutes). A 4.3-cm gray lesion was found in the specimen, and histopathologic diagnosis of pT2b N0 adenocarcinoma was made (14 lymph nodes all negative). No alteration was found in the rest of examined lung.
