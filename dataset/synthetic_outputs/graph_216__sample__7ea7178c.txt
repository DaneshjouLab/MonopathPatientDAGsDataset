A 63-year-old male with a past medical history of heavy tobacco use presented to the emergency department complaining of palpitations, cough, and shortness of breath. The patient reported experiencing palpitations and a productive cough for several weeks. An EKG revealed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. A chest x-ray revealed an irregular opacification of the left lung, and a subsequent chest CT revealed a left hilar mass extending to the left upper lobe. The left hilar mass was causing obstruction of the left upper lobe and encasing the left main pulmonary artery and left bronchus (Figure1). An endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsy revealed squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the lung. During hospitalization, the patient's atrial fibrillation was treated with metoprolol. After discharge, the patient followed up with oncology for treatment involving chemotherapy and radiation. A CT scan of the chest demonstrated a lung mass compressing on the patientâ€™s left atrium.
