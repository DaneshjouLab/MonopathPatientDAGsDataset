In April 2019, a 54-year-old Chinese woman presented with a palpable right supraclavicular lymph nodule without local redness and tenderness. A subsequent chest CT scan revealed a lobulated nodule in the right upper lobe (22 mm * 15 mm) and multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the right neck and mediastinum. Biopsy of the right supraclavicular lymph node showed poorly differentiated metastatic lung adenocarcinoma. Molecular pathologic analysis using next-generation sequencing (NGS) detected an unreported dual ALK arrangementâ€”INTS10-ALK fusion (I18: A20, 25.85%) and EML4-ALK fusion (E6: A20, 12.64%). ALK rearrangement was confirmed by Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The patient was diagnosed with right lung adenocarcinoma with mediastinal and right supraclavicular lymph node metastasis (stage IIIB, cT1cN3M0). H&E and IHC staining demonstrated at the time of diagnosis of NSCLC. Sequencing reads confirmed INTS10-ALK fusion and EML4-ALK fusion rearrangements at the time of diagnosis. INTS10 on chromosome 8 (8 exons) fused with ALK on chromosome 2 (20 exons). In May 2019, Crizotinib was administered. Radiological evaluation of the patient before and after neoadjuvant crizotinib was performed for 1 and 5 months. By October 2019, a chest CT showed the size of the nodule in the right lung had decreased to 8 mm * 5 mm.
