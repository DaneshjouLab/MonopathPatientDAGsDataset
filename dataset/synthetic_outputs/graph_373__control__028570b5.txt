This case report focuses on lung cancer screening in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). It presents two cases demonstrating the nuances that must be considered when determining if a patient could benefit from low dose computed tomography (LDCT) lung cancer screening. The report discusses the available literature regarding lung cancer screening, particularly in high-risk patients. The National Lung Cancer Screening Trial (NLST) showed that high-risk patients benefit from low dose computed tomography (LDCT) annual screening, with a 20% decrease in mortality. The report also highlights that lung cancer is the second most common malignancy worldwide, resulting in one-quarter of all cancer-related deaths, and that timely lung cancer screening and early detection has been shown to favorably impact outcomes. The report also mentions that there is limited evidence elucidating how alternate risk factors for lung cancer, such as occupational exposures or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), affect a patientâ€™s risk.
