Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are increasingly used in cancer treatment. This report reviews immune-mediated uveitis secondary to durvalumab treatment, presenting two additional clinical cases and a literature review. A PubMed search identified cases of uveitis secondary to durvalumab and uveitis with optic disc oedema secondary to ICI use reported before November 14, 2021.

The literature review identified five cases of uveitis secondary to durvalumab. The clinical presentation varied, including anterior, intermediate, and posterior uveitis, as well as retinal vasculitis. These cases were managed with local or systemic steroids. Further search revealed 12 cases of uveitis with optic disc oedema secondary to ICI use, mostly associated with PD-1 inhibitors.

In addition to the literature review, two cases of uveitis secondary to durvalumab treatment are reported. One case presented as bilateral intermediate uveitis with bilateral optic disc oedema, and the other as bilateral posterior uveitis. The search strategy, using terms like "durvalumab," "eye," "uveitis," and "inflammation," yielded five reports of uveitis secondary to durvalumab. Anterior, posterior uveitis and vasculitis were reported.

Uveitis secondary to durvalumab is rarely reported but can present with various clinical pictures, requiring a thorough diagnostic workup. Numerous cases of uveitis have been described as consequent on the immune checkpoint inhibitors.
