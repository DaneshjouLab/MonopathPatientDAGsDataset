A 66-year-old male with a 40 pack-year smoking history and sporadic alcohol consumption presented to the emergency department with sudden dyspnea. He was diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction Killip III and started on noninvasive ventilation and intravenous furosemide, which resolved the pulmonary congestion and respiratory failure within 48 hours. During this initial admission for acute heart failure, the eosinophil count was noted to be normal but progressively increased.

The patient was later found to have hypereosinophilia, with eosinophil counts reaching 40,000 eosinophils/uL. This prompted an investigation into the underlying cause, despite the patient being asymptomatic from the hypereosinophilia itself. The initial acute heart failure was attributed to coronary disease and alcohol consumption.

While a treatment course for the underlying cause of hypereosinophilia was being planned, the patient developed new-onset chest pain and was readmitted to the hospital. He was then diagnosed with pulmonary thromboembolism. Subsequently, he developed a lung abscess. Due to these complications, he was not a candidate for chemotherapy. The case highlights the importance of considering uncommon causes of acute heart failure, even in patients with existing cardiovascular risk factors, and maintaining a high degree of suspicion when facing severe analytical disturbances, even in apparently asymptomatic patients. The patient's case was complicated by pulmonary embolism and lung abscess, which precluded chemotherapy.
