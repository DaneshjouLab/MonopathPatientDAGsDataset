A female patient presented with weakness, fatigue, and orthostatic hypotension after 4 months of an unspecified therapy. Laboratory assessment revealed low serum concentrations of adrenocorticotropic hormone (&lt;5 pg/mL) and cortisol (0.8 μ/dL). She was diagnosed with hypophysitis featuring secondary adrenal insufficiency and improved with hydrocortisone treatment. After 22 months of the initial therapy, she developed an abnormal, painful cold sensation in her fingers and toes, which turned white upon cold exposure and then red upon rewarming (Raynaud's phenomenon). She was diagnosed with Raynaud's‐like phenomenon, which improved with behavior modification and treatment with calcium channel blockers.
