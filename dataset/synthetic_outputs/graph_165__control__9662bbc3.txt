A patient presented with lower urinary tract symptoms and hematuria, leading to a diagnosis of bladder cancer. Initial investigations revealed nephrolithiasis and hydronephrosis. The bladder cancer exhibited muscle invasion. The patient underwent a transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT), which revealed urothelial carcinoma. Subsequently, a radical cystectomy with ileal conduit was performed. Pathology revealed high-grade pT1 urothelial carcinoma with lymphovascular invasion. Incidentally, Gleason 3+3=6 prostatic adenocarcinoma was also discovered.

Later, the patient developed right-sided flank pain and was diagnosed with metastatic urothelial carcinoma. First-line treatment consisted of cisplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy. Due to progression of bony metastases, palliative radiotherapy was administered. The patient then developed quadriparesis secondary to a C6 metastasis. The patient underwent metastatic tumor resection, cervical decompression, and cervical fixation. The case also mentions uveal melanoma, cutaneous melanoma, mesothelioma, and renal cell carcinoma, but the relationship of these malignancies to the patient's history is not specified. The presence of a hotspot somatic variant was also noted, but its relevance to the case is unclear without further information.
