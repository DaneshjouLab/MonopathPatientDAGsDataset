A 58-year-old woman was incidentally found to have a left superior sulcus mass during evaluation for squamous cell carcinoma of her eyelid. Imaging studies revealed a 6 × 4.5 × 3.4 cm primary lung squamous cell carcinoma. After 6 months of chemotherapy and radiation therapy, imaging showed disease progression with mediastinal and anterior chest wall involvement. A multidisciplinary oncology team recommended staged surgical resection.

The patient underwent an open left upper lobectomy with en bloc first rib and partial sternal resection through a trapdoor incision. She was discharged on postoperative day 8 but returned 1 week later with chest wound dehiscence. Cultures grew coagulase-positive *Staphylococcus aureus*. Treatment included intravenous antibiotics and multiple surgical débridements, followed by reconstruction of the chest wall defect with two rotational muscle flaps and a skin graft.

Three months later, she experienced intermittent bleeding from an unhealed portion of the wound. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the thorax showed a pseudoaneurysm with a small focus of contrast material extravasation from the proximal innominate artery. The aneurysm was assumed to be mycotic, given the patient's history of wound infection. On hospital day 2, she had bleeding from the wound with hypotension and syncope requiring transfusion of blood products. She underwent an emergency right brachial cutdown and placement of two stent grafts (iCAST 9 × 38 mm) into the proximal innominate artery, with the second stent graft extending slightly into the aortic arch. A completion aortogram seemed to show adequate stent apposition to the arterial wall, with no evidence of contrast material extravasation. The patient was discharged on postprocedure day 4 and was taking 75 mg of clopidogrel daily.
