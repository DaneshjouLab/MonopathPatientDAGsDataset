In January 2016, a 26-year-old Caucasian woman was admitted to the Medical Oncology Department at Avicenne Hospital. She presented with a suspicious lung mass in the left lower lobe and bilateral lung lesions, discovered on a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan. The CT scan was performed due to low abundance hemoptysis and cervical lymphadenopathy. The patient was previously healthy, a former light smoker with an 11 pack-year history, and had no reported disease history. There was no family history of cancer, so germline mutation testing was not pursued.

An ultrasound-guided biopsy of a cervical lymph node was performed. Cell morphology was consistent with lung adenocarcinoma, and tumor cells were positive for thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1). After further assessment, the patient was diagnosed with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma (cT3N3M1a, stage IV A).

To determine the genetic alterations of the tumor, molecular analysis by next-generation sequencing (NGS) of DNA (Tumor Hot Spot MASTR Plus, Multiplicom) was performed on the cervical lymph node biopsy. The analysis revealed two point mutations in EGFR exon 18: p. G719A (C.2156G>T) and p. E709A (C 2126A>C). Immunohistochemistry showed MET hyperexpression (3+) but without MET amplification, as determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with a c-MET/chromosome 7 ratio of 2.62. No other molecular alterations were found.
