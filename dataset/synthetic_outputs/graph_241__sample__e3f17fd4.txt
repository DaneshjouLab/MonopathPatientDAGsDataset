In April 2016, a 51-year-old male with type two diabetes mellitus and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score of 1 presented with a 2-month history of consistent cough and was admitted. He was diagnosed with poorly differentiated lung adenocarcinoma in the right upper lobe with enlarged ipsilateral mediastinal lymph node and malignant pleural effusion (MPE) confirmed by cytological examination (cT3N2M1a, IVa). Immunohistochemistry results were: PCK(+), CK7 (focally +), TTF-1(+), CK18(+), CK5/6(-), P63(scattered +), CK14(-), CDX-2(-), CD56(+), CgA(-), Sgn(-), Ki-67(~50%). Percutaneous needle biopsy confirmed an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutation (exon 21 L858R). The patient was then prescribed gefitinib (250 mg, QD). After 4 months of gefitinib treatment, a chest computed tomography scan showed excellent radiographic response. In August 2016, the patient received lobectomy and systematic lymph node dissection under video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). Intraoperative findings revealed no pleural involvement, confirmed by pleural biopsy. The patient was discharged uneventfully on postoperative day 5. Postoperative pathology showed no residual tumor in the right upper lobe nor in the mediastinal lymph node, confirming pathological complete response to gefitinib (ypT0N0M0). Numerous chronic inflammatory cells, foamy histiocytes, and dense fibrosis were observed with no viable tumor seen. Immunohistochemistry results were: PCK(-), EMA(-), CK7(-), TTF-1(-), NapsinA(-), CK5/6(-), P63(-), PGM-1 (inflammatory cells+). The patient discontinued gefitinib and underwent four cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy (cisplatinum 40 mg on days 1-3 and pemetrexed 800 mg on day 1). In December 2016, the patient finished the last course of adjuvant chemotherapy with only grade 2 leukopenia and no grade 3-4 drug-related adverse events. The patient was followed up regularly every 3-4 months with chest and abdominal CT scans and tumor biomarkers and annual PET/CT scan.
