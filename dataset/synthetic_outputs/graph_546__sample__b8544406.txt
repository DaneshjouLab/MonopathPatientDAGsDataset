A 51-year-old woman with no smoking history was admitted after a chest shadow was detected in her right lung during a routine check-up. A subsequent CT scan revealed a 14 x 10 mm pure ground-glass nodule in the apical segmental (S1) bronchus of the right upper lobe. Further investigation with 3D CT, intraoperative scanning, and tracheoscopy revealed an apical (S1) and posterior segmental (S2) bronchus originating directly from the main trachea/right wall of the trachea, and the pulmonary vein of the apical segmental (V1) bronchus running dorsal to the pulmonary artery. Bronchus anatomy was confirmed by tracheoscopy, revealing a tracheal bronchus (TB) on computed tomography imaging and by tracheoscopy. The patient was asymptomatic according to normal physical examination and blood test analysis. No distant metastases were detected by bone radioisotopic scanning.

Based on these findings, the patient was scheduled for right apical segmentectomy with mediastinal lymph node sampling for suspected adenocarcinoma. During the procedure, the artery of the apical segment (A1) was ligated and cut, and the apical segmental bronchus (B1) was isolated and cut. The pulmonary vein (V1) was ligated and cut at the rear of the apical segmental bronchus. Lymph nodes around the TB were resected, and right apical segmentectomy was completed using end staplers. Pathological diagnosis confirmed minimally invasive adenocarcinoma with negative margins and no evidence of lymph node metastasis. The postoperative course was uneventful.

The patient recovered well postoperatively and was discharged 5 days post-operation.
