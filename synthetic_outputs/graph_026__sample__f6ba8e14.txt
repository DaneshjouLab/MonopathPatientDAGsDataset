In November 2022, a 73-year-old East Asian woman with a medical history of hypertension, no smoking history, and no family history of cancer was admitted to the Pulmonology Department for evaluation of an abnormal chest CT scan. She presented with no respiratory symptoms such as cough or dyspnea. The initial chest CT revealed a 1.1-cm spiculated nodule in the right middle lobe (RML), multiple pleural nodules with mild pleural thickening, and fibrotic lesions in the right upper lobe (RUL). These findings prompted a linear endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) of enlarged lymph node 7. The EBUS-TBNA revealed metastatic adenocarcinoma with ALK rearrangement, wild type EGFR mutation, and echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML 4)-ALK fusion. First biopsy of the mediastinal 7th lymph node: H&E staining of the lymph node, positive for ALK stain of the lymph node. Subsequent PET-CT revealed pleural, multiple enhancing nodules with lymph nodes metastasis, leading to a diagnosis of stage IV lung cancer (T2N2M1a). Targeted mutation chemotherapy with alectinib was initiated and continued for a period of one and a half years. Follow-up chest CT scans during treatment with alectinib demonstrated a reduction in the lung mass and pleural metastatic lesions. However, in July 2024, a chest CT showed the previously observed main mass in the RML.
