A patient presented with a complex medical history involving multiple cancer diagnoses and treatments. The patient was initially diagnosed with Thymic Epithelial Tumours (TETs), specifically Thymic carcinoma (TC). The TC was further characterized by various subtypes including squamous, basaloid, mucoepidermoid, sarcomatoid, small cell, adenocarcinoma lymphoepithelial-like, clear cell, and undifferentiated squamous cell subtype. The patient underwent mediastinal radiotherapy and platinum-based chemotherapy as initial treatments for the TC.

Following treatment for TC, the patient developed metastatic disease and recurrent TETs. Subsequent treatments included sunitinib, everolimus, and potentially anthracycline-based chemotherapy. The patient was also considered for Immuno-oncology (IO) treatment, specifically pembrolizumab, targeting the PD-L1 pathway.

During the course of treatment, the patient developed myocarditis. The patient's medical history also included diagnoses of melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), urothelial cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and head and neck cancer, indicating a complex oncological background. The patient was also treated with sunitinib malate and Lenvatinib, potentially targeting VEGF, VEGFR2, and PDGFR-Î±.
