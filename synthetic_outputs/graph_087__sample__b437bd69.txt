A 56-year-old non-smoking male with pulmonary carcinosarcoma presented at The Third Peopleâ€™s Hospital of Yunnan Province on January 28, 2023, with a progressively enlarging mass in the right neck. Cervico-thoracic CT imaging revealed multiple nodular shadows of various sizes within the right cervical region posterior to the sternocleidomastoid muscle and adjacent to the carotid artery sheath, which partially fused. The largest measured approximately 3.8 cm x 2.6 cm with indistinct margins and uneven ring-shaped enhancement. CT imaging revealed compression of the right parapharyngeal soft tissue and right jugular vein. Enlarged and partially fused lymph nodes were identified in the mediastinum. A 9.8 cm x 8.0 cm round mass with well-defined borders, uneven density, and heterogeneous enhancement was identified in the extra-basal segment of the left lower lung lobe. Suspected pulmonary malignancy with cervical and mediastinal lymph node metastasis. CT scans of the head and abdomen showed no significant abnormalities. Hematological examination showed no significant abnormalities. CT-guided puncture biopsy of the mass in the left inferior lobe of the lung was performed. Pathological diagnosis of lung carcinosarcoma was established. Immunohistochemistry showed a Ki-67 index of 80%.
