A 65-year-old male ex-smoker presented with left shoulder pain and abnormalities on chest radiography. Interval history revealed a tracheostomy performed 10 years prior due to purulent tonsillitis. Pulmonary function tests were normal (forced expiratory volume in 1 second 105%; diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide 121%). Diagnostic workup, including transbronchial biopsy, PET scan, and endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsy, revealed squamous cell carcinoma with tumor invasion of the left subclavian vein and the sternal attachment of the first rib and anterior aspect of the second rib (cT4N0M0). MRI confirmed chest wall and vein invasion, but no apparent invasion to the left subclavian artery or brachial plexus. A left subclavian vein thrombus was detected. Preoperative CT of the chest showed the tumor invading close to the sternoclavicular joint and thrombus in the left subclavian vein adjacent to the tumor. Resection of the chest wall and left upper lobe was performed. One month post-operative follow-up was conducted. The tumor was discussed with the cardiology department regarding the risk of pulmonary thrombosis during standard induction therapy.
