A 57-year-old Japanese woman with no history of smoking was followed up by the Department of Otorhinolaryngology for a left parotid tumor. An enlarged left supraclavicular fossa lymph node was detected, and adenocarcinoma was diagnosed based on aspiration cytology. The tumor marker carcinoembryonic antigen level was very high at 2,058 µg/L. Subsequent chest imaging suggested primary lung cancer, leading to a referral to the Department of Respiratory Medicine. Computed tomography of the chest revealed a 25 × 14 mm nodular shadow in the right S5 lobe and enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes with extensive calcification. A bronchoscopy with transbronchial lung biopsy of the right S5 nodule confirmed the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma. Histopathological evaluation revealed an infiltrative proliferation of atypical cells with mutual adhesion and glandular cavity formation. Immunohistochemical staining revealed positive thyroid transcription factor-1 and negative p40, consistent with lung adenocarcinoma. The biopsy specimen was analyzed using the AmoyDx® Pan Lung Cancer PCR Panel, which detected ROS1 fusions. Positron emission tomography-CT showed fluorodeoxyglucose accumulation in the contralateral hilar lymph node. The patient was diagnosed with stage IIIB lung adenocarcinoma (cT1cN3M0) according to the 8th edition of the American Joint Committee.
