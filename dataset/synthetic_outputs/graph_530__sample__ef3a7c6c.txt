In January 2019, a 69-year-old Chinese male ex-smoker with a 10-year history of type 2 diabetes presented with dizziness and unsteady walking for two months. A CT scan of the chest revealed two masses and multiple nodules in the right lower lobe. Brain magnetic resonance (MR) imaging found multiple metastases, and ECT showed enhanced radioactivity at T2 and L4. Percutaneous biopsy led to a diagnosis of stage IV (T3N0M1) lung adenocarcinoma. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) testing showed an EGFR exon 20 insertion (p.D770-N771insGT) mutation with concurring ERBB2 and TP53 mutations. ERBB2 P1170A and TP53 R197_V197insA mutations were classified as benign and a variant of unknown significance (VUS), respectively. Gene check analysis confirmed the EGFR exon 20 insertion (p.D770-N771insGT) mutation.

The patient refused chemotherapy and whole-brain radiation. He was subsequently administered osimertinib (80 mg daily) and experienced grade 1 nausea, which disappeared 20 days later. A 4-month follow-up showed that lesions on the right lung and brain achieved partial response by RECIST (version 1.1; -37.5% and -52.3% response, respectively).

At the end of May 2019, the patient complained of headache, and MRI showed progression of the brain lesion. On June 6, 2019, bevacizumab (400 mg/month) was added to the osimertinib regimen. The patient's CNS symptoms cleared, the brain nodule stopped growing, and edema was eliminated. The lung lesion achieved partial response again (version 1.1; -82.2% response) with the combination therapy (osimertinib and bevacizumab). Follow-up at 2.1, 4.5, 6.5, and 9.1 months after the combination therapy showed ongoing clinical benefit and stable disease.

Two months before death, the patient experienced a significant decline in physical activity and consciousness. A CT scan of the chest revealed no progressive disease. Laboratory tests showed hemoglobin 96 g/L and creatinine 177.7 umol/L.
