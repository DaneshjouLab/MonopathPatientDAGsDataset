A 60-year-old female patient presented to her local hospital in December 2021 with a several-month history of worsening cough and fever. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest revealed a large right pulmonary upper lobe mass, which was managed with surgical resection. The postoperative histologic examination was diagnostic for inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) with positive surgical margins and evidence of pleural invasion. Three months after surgery, the patient presented with fever, cough, and weight loss. Imaging with CT and positron emission tomography confirmed the presence of locally recurrent disease and metastatic spread to the ileum, right supraclavicular fossa, and soft tissue of the right thigh. The ileal metastasis was removed for symptomatic relief and an RNA-based next-generation sequencing gene fusion assay identified an *EML4-ALK* fusion (*EML4* exon 2 to *ALK* exon 20). The patient commenced treatment with the ALK inhibitor crizotinib (250 mg twice daily) with rapid clinical benefit and symptom resolution. The tumor remained stable by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 at all sites of disease until the completion of cycle 5 of treatment; at that time, the patient returned to the clinic with enlargement of the right supraclavicular fossa mass, causing difficulty swallowing and speaking, indicating isolated disease progression of the supraclavicular mass.
