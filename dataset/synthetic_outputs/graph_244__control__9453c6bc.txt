In 2019, a 41-year-old female presented to the Thoracic Clinic with a history of a 7-mm ground-glass opacity (GGO) in the right upper lobe with mixed-density on chest computed tomography (CT) scan. The GGO had initially measured 5.5 mm when first found by chest CT at a health check-up 1 year prior. At that time, the patient had no symptoms, and the physical examination revealed no positive findings. The patient denied any family history of lung cancer or any history of smoking, occupational exposure, or tuberculosis/fungal infection. The radiation characteristics of the lesion were associated with malignant disease, which showed mixed density and spiculation. The patient underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery segmentectomy for peripheral small lung cancer. The patient was discharged on the 5th postoperative day without complications or adverse events, except slight chest pain that lasted for about 2 weeks postoperatively. Chest CT scans in the 12th and 24th months after surgery showed good lung recovery, and no atelectasis or pulmonary congestion was observed.
