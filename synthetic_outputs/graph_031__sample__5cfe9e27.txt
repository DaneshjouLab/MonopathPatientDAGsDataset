A 73-year-old male presented with fatigue and weight loss. The patient had a history of situs inversus totalis (SIT) since early adulthood, discovered incidentally on a chest X-ray. Additional history included ex-smoker (5 pack-year history, quit 40 years prior), mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidaemia, peptic ulcer disease, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, diverticulosis, and colonic polyps. The patient underwent CT thorax, abdomen, and pelvis, which showed a 20x20 mm nodule in the right upper lobe with a 7x4 mm central solid component, and an 8 mm ground glass opacity with a central solid dot in the right lower lobe. No lymphadenopathy was detected. A PET scan showed mild FDG uptake in the solid component of the nodule and some calcification in mediastinal lymph nodules, with no obvious nodal or distant metastasis. The patient was diagnosed with stage 1a (cT1cN0M0) lung adenocarcinoma. He subsequently underwent VATS right upper lobectomy and right lower lobe superior segmentectomy. A wedge resection of the lower lobe nodule was sent for frozen section, confirming adenocarcinoma with the absence of lymph node involvement. Histology confirmed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma pT1cN0 in the right upper lobe and moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma pT1aN0 in the right lower lobe with clear margins for both. The patient was discharged post-operative Day 9. He was reviewed 2 weeks post-discharge and planned for surveillance with his respiratory physician, including a post-operative CT thorax, abdomen, and pelvis.
