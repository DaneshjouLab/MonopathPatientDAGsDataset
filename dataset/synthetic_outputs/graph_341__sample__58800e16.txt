A 43-year-old woman presented with occupation of the upper lobe of the right lung during a physical examination. Initial workup included a chest CT scan on 2020-10-22, which revealed a nodule in the upper lobe of the right lung (0.8 x 0.4 cm) and bulky swollen mediastinal lymph nodes (4.4 x 3.3 cm). A PET/CT scan indicated a mildly fluorodeoxyglucose-avid nodule in the right upper lobe, and high metabolic nodules and masses in the mediastinum 2R and 4R groups. Tumor marker tests on 2020-10-23 showed CEA at 145.20 ng/mL, CA199 at 27.47 ng/mL, and CA724 at 7.17 ng/mL. A needle biopsy of the mediastinal lymph nodes revealed lung adenocarcinoma with Ki-67 > 60% and PD-L1 > 50%. Genetic testing was negative for EGFR, ALK, KRAS, RET, and ROS1 mutations. The patient was diagnosed with stage IIIA NSCLC (cT1N2M0) with no evidence of distant metastatic disease.

The patient underwent two cycles of neoadjuvant sintilimab plus chemotherapy. A chest CT scan on 2020-12-01, after two cycles of neoadjuvant therapy, showed a mildly FDG-avid mass in the upper lobe of the right lung (SUVmax= 1.0) and intensely FDG-avid lymph nodes in the mediastinum 2R and 4R groups (SUVmax= 14.0) on PET-CT before neoadjuvant therapy. After two cycles of sintilimab combined with nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin, the target lesion was slightly reduced (0.8 x 0.3 cm) and the efficacy was evaluated as stable disease. The mediastinal lymph nodes were significantly narrower compared to before (2.2 x 1.7 cm) and the efficacy was evaluated as partial response (PR) on the basis of RECIST version 1.1.

Asynchrony of primary tumor and mediastinal lymph nodes remission was found, as well as the mismatch between the imaging and pathology. The patient's vital signs were stable, and no signs of recurrence were observed.

On 2020-12-15, the patient underwent right upper lung lobectomy plus lymph nodes dissection via thoracoscopy, achieving margin-negative (R0) resection. Postoperative chronic pathology revealed no cancer residue.
