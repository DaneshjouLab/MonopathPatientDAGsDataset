A male construction worker in his mid-sixties with a history of asbestos exposure visited a family doctor with a persistent cough and fever. Chest radiography revealed left pleural effusion. One month later, the patient was referred to Chugoku Central Hospital. Serum tumor markers CEA, cytokeratin 19 fragment, and Î±-fetoprotein were within normal limits. Hyaluronic acid was abnormally elevated (>200,000 ng/ml) in the pleural effusion. CT and endoscopy revealed multinodular or cystic lesions in the left parietal pleura of the mediastinum and diaphragm. Pleural effusion cytology and tumor biopsy were performed, leading to a diagnosis of epithelioid mesothelioma with a prominent myxoid stroma. The lesion was totally excised. The first course of chemotherapy comprising carboplatin and pemetrexed sodium hemipentahydrate was initiated. Three weeks after the first course, a second course of chemotherapy comprising carboplatin and pemetrexed sodium hemipentahydrate was performed.
