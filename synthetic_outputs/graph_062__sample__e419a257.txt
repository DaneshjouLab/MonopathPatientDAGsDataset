A 38-year-old man presented with a chronic recurrent dry cough over a month, denying fever, sputum or blood production and chest pain. The patient's chronic recurrent dry cough prompted a chest CT scan, which revealed pulmonary masses at an external hospital. Detection of pulmonary masses on CT led to admission to the oncology department for further evaluation and treatment. As part of the evaluation, the patient's medical history was reviewed, revealing no history of hypertension, coronary heart disease, diabetes, cerebral venous thrombosis or hemorrhage, tuberculosis, chronic hepatitis B virus infection and other diseases. Vitals and labs were taken as part of the evaluation. Vitals: Temperature 37.2 \u00b0C, pulse rate 118 bpm, respiratory rate 20 breaths/minute, blood pressure 106/69 mmHg. Labs: White blood cells 7.97 \u00d7 109/L, hemoglobin 142 g/L, platelets 287 \u00d7 109/L, neutrophil percentage 46.7%. Total prostate-specific antigen 5.77 ng/mL, cytokeratin 19 fragment 13.39 ng/mL, neuron-specific enolase 17.5 \u03bcg/L. Thyroid function, electrolytes, liver and kidney function, myocardial enzymes and inorganic ions were normal. Additional labs were taken as part of the evaluation, including Treponema pallidum-specific antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C.
