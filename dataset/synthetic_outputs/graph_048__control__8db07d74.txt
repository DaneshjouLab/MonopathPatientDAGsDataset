A patient was diagnosed with advanced lung adenocarcinoma, stage T1cN3M1c IVb, which included multiple brain metastases. A biopsy of the right supraclavicular lymph node confirmed the diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma. At the time of diagnosis, the patient reported headaches and experienced sleep disturbances. After one month of treatment, the longest diameter of the left upper lung nodule decreased from 19 mm to 12 mm, and there was a notable reduction in the right hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes. Additionally, the patientâ€™s intracranial metastatic lesion reduced in size from 19 mm to 8 mm, leading to an improvement in her headache symptoms. Significant improvements were noted in her headache and insomnia symptoms. The main adverse reactions experienced include grade 2 blurred vision and oral mucositis, both of which improved with symptomatic treatment.
