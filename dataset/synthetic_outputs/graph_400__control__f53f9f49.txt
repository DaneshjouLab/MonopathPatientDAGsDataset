Case report: A patient with lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) presented with a novel FGFR3-IER5L fusion mutation. LUSC is the second most common pathological type of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), accounting for 25-30% of all lung cancer cases. Compared to lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), LUSC has a lower incidence of driver gene mutations and limited targeted drug options. The patient, whose demographics are not specified, refused surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy. Next-generation sequencing revealed the FGFR3-IER5L fusion. The patient received anlotinib treatment, a small molecular multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits kinases including VEGFR2/3, FGFR1-4, PDGFRα/β, and c-Kit. The patient achieved a partial response, and the progression-free survival was 3.8 months.
