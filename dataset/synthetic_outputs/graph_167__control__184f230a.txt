A 58-year-old man was diagnosed with stage IVB lung adenocarcinoma in the right upper lobe and underwent systemic chemotherapy. Seven months after the diagnosis, large left pleural and pericardial effusion was detected. The patient developed both chylothorax and chylopericardium following superior vena cava (SVC) obstruction with mediastinal lymphadenopathy caused by lung carcinoma. Since conservative treatment of the chyle leakage was ineffective, we administered radiotherapy to treat the SVC obstruction and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. After radiotherapy, the chylothorax and chylopericardium gradually resolved, and no further chyle leaks were identified on follow-up computed tomography. This case indicates that radiotherapy can be used to ameliorate lung cancer-related chylothorax and chylopericardium.
