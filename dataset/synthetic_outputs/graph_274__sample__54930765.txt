A 61-year-old male presented with a nine-month history of stage IV (T2aN2M1) NSCLC with mediastinal lymphadenopathy, extensive left pleural involvement, and erosion into the left posterior rib. The lung cancer was originally diagnosed following three months of progressive left lower rib pain. CT of the thorax revealed a 3 cm left upper lobe nodule and destruction of the left posterior ninth rib. Fine-needle aspiration of the primary lesion confirmed squamous cell carcinoma. The patient underwent 17 fractions of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) to the left posterior ribs. Subsequently, the patient developed worsening dyspnea on exertion and was readmitted for left pleural effusion. The patient was discharged after placement of a flexible drainage catheter (PleurX\u2122), with drainage fluid confirming malignant effusion. The patient was consented and scheduled for induction chemoimmunotherapy with carboplatin, paclitaxel, and pembrolizumab with zoledronic acid infusions to control hypercalcemia. Prior to initiation of therapy, the platelet level was 165,000/\u00b5L.
