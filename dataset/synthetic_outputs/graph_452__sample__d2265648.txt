A 71-year-old male presented in November 2023 with a 2-month history of intermittent cough, chest pain, fever, and hemoptysis. A chest CT revealed a perihilar mass in the lower lobe of the right lung, extending into the pulmonary arteriovenous structures and the left atrium. Further imaging with FDG PET/CT identified right lung cancer with multiple lymph node metastases as well as hypermetabolic foci in the left atrium and left ventricle of the heart. Transthoracic echocardiography showed a slightly higher echoic mass attached to the atrial septum at the base of the proximal anterior mitral valve in the left atrium, and a slightly higher echo group attached in the middle of the left ventricular posterior septum. An electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed a normal sinus rhythm. Biopsy via fiberoptic bronchoscopy confirmed lung squamous cell carcinoma with necrosis visible in the focal area. Immunohistochemistry revealed a high level of programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, with a tumor proportion score (TPS) of ~80%. The patient has a performance status of 0. Sintilimab (200 mg every 3 weeks) was administered as immunotherapy. After two cycles of immunotherapy, echocardiography showed the disappearance of the left atrial metastasis and a slight reduction in the left ventricular metastasis.
