A 61-year-old female patient presented with a lung mass. In March 2019, she underwent right middle and lower lobe resection, systematic lymph node dissection, and closed thoracic drainage. Intraoperative findings revealed a tumor located at the opening of the right lower lobe bronchus, measuring approximately 4 cm x 3 cm. Postoperative pathology confirmed a poorly differentiated large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) with metastasis to groups 3, 7, and 11 lymph nodes. The tumor was staged as T2aN2M0, stage IIIA. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) results were: TTF-1 (+), Napsin A (-), Vimentin (-), CKp (+), CK5/6 (-), CK7 (+), P40 (-), Syn (+), CgA (+), CD56 (+), Ki-67 (proliferation index: 60%), ALK (+). Next-generation sequencing (NGS) revealed an EML4-ALK fusion mutation. Postoperative treatment was initiated with paclitaxel and lobaplatin chemotherapy combined with crizotinib 250 mg twice daily. After one cycle of chemotherapy, the patient experienced severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions and chemotherapy was discontinued. She continued with oral crizotinib targeted therapy. Crizotinib was discontinued in April 2022 due to a severe drug-induced skin rash. During medication, the lesions remained stable, with no postoperative tumor recurrence or interstitial pneumonia. A PET/CT scan performed at another hospital showed slight narrowing of the left main bronchus.
