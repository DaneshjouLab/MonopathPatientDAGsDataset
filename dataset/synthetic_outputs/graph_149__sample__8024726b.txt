A 21-year-old Chinese male was diagnosed with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma in February 2016. The disease involved metastases in cervical, hilar, and mediastinal lymph nodes, as well as pericardial effusion. The primary tumor size was 1.5 cm by 1.5 cm. A cervical lymph node biopsy was performed. Comprehensive genomic profiling using next-generation sequencing (NGS) targeting 382 cancer-relevant genes was performed on the baseline lymph node biopsy specimen, pericardial effusion ctDNA, and plasma ctDNA samples. No actionable driver mutations were detected in any sample. The patient received six cycles of first-line chemotherapy with pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) and cisplatin (75 mg/m2), resulting in a partial response (PR) per RECIST 1.1 guidelines. A post-chemotherapy plasma ctDNA sample tested in August 2016 using NGS with a targeted gene panel showed no mutation detected. The patient continued maintenance chemotherapy with ten cycles of pemetrexed (500 mg/m2). In October 2017, disease progression with bone metastases was detected. The primary lung lesion remained stable. FFPE (cervical lymph node) analysis was performed at diagnosis (February 2020).
