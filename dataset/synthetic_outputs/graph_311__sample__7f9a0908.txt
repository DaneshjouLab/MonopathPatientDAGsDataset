A 65-year-old man with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) stage III and severe emphysema was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma, radial-endobronchial ultrasound (R-EBUS) stage IV due to bone metastasis. Evaluation of a tissue sample revealed programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression of 100%. Pembrolizumab was initiated. Three hours later, the patient presented with severe dyspnea. Electrocardiogram (ECG) and CT scan of the thorax revealed a massive pneumothorax. A 30F chest tube was inserted under fluoroscopy. The patient underwent pleurodesis with talc poudrage and continued therapy. Chest x-ray showed right lung expansion with chest tube in place. The patient was discharged after five days and continues immunotherapy treatment pending restaging. The pneumothorax has not re-occurred.
