A patient with advanced lung adenocarcinoma developed severe thrombocytopenia after receiving the PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab. In November 2020, the patient developed thrombocytopenia (platelet level: 91Ã—10<sup>3</sup>/ul) with normal hemoglobin and normal white cell counts. The patient received interleukin-11 (IL-11) therapy to enhance the proliferation of megalokaryocytes for 2 weeks. Unfortunately, the platelet count slightly declined, and no autoimmune or coagulation disorders were displayed. As a result, the diagnosis was presumed as ICIs-induced thrombocytopenia, and the patient was treated with prednisone for 2 weeks (0.5mg/kg). However, the thrombocytopenia became worse with a sudden decrease in platelet level.
