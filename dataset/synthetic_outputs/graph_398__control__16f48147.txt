A patient with xeroderma pigmentosum developed multiple skin cancers, including squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma. The patient also presented with lung adenocarcinoma harboring an EGFR mutation, specifically EGFR T790M. The patient's medical history included diabetes mellitus, hypertension, osteoarthritis, common bile duct stones, gallbladder stones, cataracts, glaucoma, colon cancer, chronic kidney disease and dementia.

The patient was initially treated with cisplatin and radiotherapy for the lung adenocarcinoma. Following disease progression, the patient was treated with gefitinib, but eventually developed resistance. Subsequent treatment with osimertinib was initiated. The patient later developed aspiration pneumonia. The case also notes the patient's risk of developing other cancers, including leukemia, cancers of the lung, malignant brain and spinal cord tumors, and cancers of the breast, uterus, pancreas, stomach, kidneys, and testicles.
