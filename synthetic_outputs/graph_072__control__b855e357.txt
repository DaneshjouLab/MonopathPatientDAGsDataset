An 81-year-old man with lung cancer developed type 1 diabetes following 14 cycles of treatment with Anlotinib, a novel oral multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). At the time of diagnosis, his fasting plasma blood glucose was 24.3 mmol/L, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was 9.0%, and glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody (GADA) was more than 2000 IU/ml (normal range is less than 10 IU/ml). Studies have shown that some tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) can influence glucose metabolism leading to either hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia which is reversable in most patients after treatment cessation.
