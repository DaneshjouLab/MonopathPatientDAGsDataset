A 61-year-old male patient with no history of chronic disease presented to the outpatient clinic with persistent abdominal discomfort and pain that had progressed over several years. He also reported bloating and loss of appetite. He had consulted different outpatient clinics multiple times and was prescribed various medications for bloating and abdominal discomfort by general practitioners, but these failed to relieve his symptoms. He stated that a mild pain had persisted for several years, during which he was not admitted to any clinic. In recent weeks, the frequency of his symptoms increased, prompting him to seek treatment from different outpatient clinics. He had no history of smoking, alcohol consumption, or previous abdominal surgery.

Physical examination revealed mild epigastric tenderness, but was otherwise unremarkable. Hemogram and biochemistry panel results were within normal limits. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) detected multiple loculated collection areas in the abdomen, the largest of which was observed in the subdiaphragmatic area at the anterior of the liver, adjacent to hepatic segments 8, 4, and 5, measuring 4.7 × 11 × 10 cm in diameter. The mass did not contain any solid components or pathological contrast enhancement. The result of the indirect hemagglutination test was < 1/80 (negative < 1/160).

Due to the lack of a definitive diagnosis after extensive clinical evaluation, a diagnostic laparotomy was performed for possible intra-abdominal malignancy. During the operation, a yellowish-pink, soft, fluid-filled multiloculated cystic mass measuring 10 × 15 cm adhered to the anterior surface of the liver, and numerous similar small cystic lesions were scattered on the right paracolic area and peritoneal surfaces. All cystic lesions were excised with LigaSure and electrocautery. An appendectomy was performed for possible appendiceal malignancy.

After successful surgical resection of the lesions, the pathology was found compatible with benign multicystic peritoneal mesothelioma (BMPM). The patient was diagnosed with BMPM, a rare diagnosis. The treatment of choice for BMPM is surgical excision.
