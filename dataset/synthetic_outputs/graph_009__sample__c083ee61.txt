In March 2025, a 73-year-old female presented with bilateral chest wall discomfort, exertional breathlessness, and chronic fatigue. Her chest radiograph showed a left lung opacification. CT and PET-CT scan confirmed a 53 mm avid left upper lobe mass with associated hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy (T3N2M0). Endobronchial ultrasound scan and biopsy (EBUS) sampling of station 11L confirmed lung adenocarcinoma metastasis. Molecular testing showed 60% PD-L1 positivity. PD-L1 staining appeared positive. Other immunohistochemistry (ALK/ROS/NTRK) was negative. Lung function tests revealed 51% forced expiratory volume (FEV1) (1.21) and 73% diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO). The patient consented to radical treatment with four weeks of radiotherapy dosed at 55 Gy/20 with concurrent chemotherapy. Initial scan post radiotherapy showed a limited response to treatment (Figure2). A subsequent CT scan in a year showed that there was no tumor visible on axial images but there was apparent collapse of the left lung base (Figure3). Post radiotherapy imaging showed complete response to treatment. Two small bullae were seen in the post aspect of the lower lobe. Five months later, a follow-up scan showed upward curving of the lower segmental bronchi and pulmonary vessels. Imaging showed the two small bullae initially seen in the post aspect of the lower lobe relocated to the upper zone anteriorly. Lung torsion with 180-degree rotation was diagnosed. Follow-up imaging 12 months after previous imaging demonstrated migration of the emphysematous bullae anteriorly and superiorly towards the apex of the lung. CT imaging showed left lung base collapse and tapering/curved orientation of the lower lobe segmental bronchi and pulmonary vessels of the right lung, indicating twisting of the lobe. Lung torsion with 180-degree rotation was diagnosed, likely caused by radiotherapy. The patient was asymptomatic and managed conservatively.
