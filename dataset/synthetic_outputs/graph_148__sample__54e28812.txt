A 34-year-old man, diagnosed with lung cancer (mucoepidermoid carcinoma) 6 months prior, underwent right lower lobectomy and chemoradiotherapy. This treatment was not effective. Subsequently, the patient developed speech disturbance and right hemiparesis and was transferred to the emergency department 47 minutes after onset. Upon arrival, the patient had an NIHSS score of 17 and a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 13 (E4V3M6). Examination revealed motor aphasia, right hemiparesis, and left conjugate deviation of the eyes. Lab results showed an elevated white blood cell count of 12,700/\u03bcL (normal range: 4000\u20137800/\u03bcL) and an elevated D-dimer of 32.5 \u03bcg/mL (normal range: <1 \u03bcg/mL). Head MRI-DWI showed early ischemic change in the frontal and temporal areas, with an Alberta Stroke Programme Early CT Score (ASPECTS) of 6. Head MRA demonstrated complete occlusion of the left intracranial internal carotid artery (ICA). Diagnostic angiogram confirmed complete occlusion at the terminal end of the left ICA. Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator injection (IV t-PA) followed by MT was performed. A 9-Fr balloon guiding catheter, OPTIMO (Tokai Medical Products, Aichi, Japan), was introduced into the left ICA cervical portion, and a Penumbra ACE 68 (Penumbra Inc., Alameda, CA, USA) was easily navigated to the occlusion site. The ACE 68 contacted the embolus, and aspiration of the embolus was started with a MAX pump (Penumbra Inc.) for 90 seconds. The ACE 68 was withdrawn into the OPTIMO, and the left ICA was recanalized. Occlusion remained at the
