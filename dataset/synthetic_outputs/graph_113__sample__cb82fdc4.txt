A 74-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with an upper left lung tumor indicated on a chest X-ray. He had a 30 pack-year smoking history and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 0. His squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC) level was 2.2 ng/mL (normal range: 0–1.5 ng/mL), and his Salyl Lewis X-i (SLX) level was 42.3 ng/mL (normal range: 0–38.0 ng/mL). A PET-CT scan revealed fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in a 6-cm tumor shadow in the upper lobe of the left lung, metastatic tumors in the left lung and right adrenal gland, and a retroperitoneal tumor. Increased diffuse bone marrow FDG uptake was also observed.

The patient underwent wedge resection of the left upper lung with the tumor shadow and was diagnosed with T4N0M1c stage IVB primary NSCLC-NOS. Immunohistochemistry was negative for thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1), napsin A, p40, chromogranin A, synaptophysin, and CD56 staining. Lung tumors showed a tumor proportion score (TPS) of 50–60% for programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) (22C3) and no expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements. Blood testing on admission showed leucocytosis (48,800/μL) and neutrophilia (43,600/μL) with abnormally high expression of serum G-CSF (502.2 pg/mL, normal range: <39.0 pg/mL). The patient was diagnosed with advanced G-CSF-producing NSCLC-NOS that was compatible with diffuse uptake of FDG into the bone marrow owing to G-CSF-producing carcinoma.

Treatment with the anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) antibody pembrolizumab (200 mg/body) was started and repeated every three weeks. After seven courses of pembrolizumab, the patient developed grade 3 type 1 diabetes, and pembrolizumab treatment was discontinued.
