Initial laboratory tests revealed creatine kinase (CK) 11,002 U/L, myoglobin (Mb) > 2,000 ng/mL, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 165 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 518 U/L, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 846 U/L. By May 24, serum CK had increased to 14,947 U/L, Mb remained > 2,000 ng/mL, ALT was 325 U/L, AST was 1,146 U/L, and LDH was 1,236 U/L. The patient was admitted to the hospital with progressed generalized muscle pain and weakness following chemotherapy for small cell lung cancer.

Laboratory tests showed substantially increased serum CK, Mb, ALT, AST, and LDH. Cardiac troponin I (cTnI) was 46.5 pg/mL, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was 1.
