An octogenarian male with advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma developed neurological toxicity following treatment with pembrolizumab. The patient was also noted to have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He was diagnosed with pembrolizumab-induced autoimmune encephalitis after a multidisciplinary differential diagnosis. The case highlights the importance of early detection of immune-mediated neurotoxic effects, especially in elderly patients. The case emphasizes the importance of interdisciplinary work and comprehensive geriatric assessment to prevent functional decline in elderly patients undergoing immunotherapy.
