A 46-year-old man with pre-existing hypertension and dyslipidemia (diagnosed 4 months prior) and new-onset diabetes mellitus (unveiled 1 month prior) was referred to the emergency department for hypokalemia. Hormonal study and dynamic biochemical tests indicated ectopic Cushing syndrome (ECS). Imaging and cytological findings pointed toward a likely primary right parotid malignancy with liver metastases, suggesting metastatic parotid acinic cell carcinoma (ACC). The patient underwent right parotidectomy, and histopathologic examination confirmed ACC. Meanwhile, hypercortisolism was managed with metyrapone and ketoconazole.

Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) ectopic production is a rare cause of Cushing syndrome (CS). The most commonly associated tumors are small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) along with bronchial and thymic carcinoids. To date, only 5 cases have been published in the literature featuring ectopic ACTH secretion from metastatic acinic cell carcinoma (ACC) of the parotid gland. This case describes a very uncommon presentation of ectopic CS (ECS) unveiling a metastatic parotid ACC.
