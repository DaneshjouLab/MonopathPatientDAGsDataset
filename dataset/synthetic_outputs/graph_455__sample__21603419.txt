A 62-year-old male presented with slow growth of a known multinodular goiter. He had a history of partial thyroidectomy 30 years prior in the Philippines, a remote smoking history, and no known radiation exposure. His family history was notable for an aunt with a goiter. The patient had no compressive symptoms but repeatedly declined surgical resection until convinced by family and friends. TSH and T4 values were within normal limits. Due to the slow growth of the goiter, CT imaging of the neck and chest was performed, revealing a markedly enlarged multinodular thyroid gland (14.6x6.1x14.5 cm3) with extension into the mediastinum and a heterogeneous nodule (3.2x4.0x4.7 cm3) just inferior but adjacent to the presumed thyroid mass. Because of the enlarged multinodular thyroid gland with mediastinal extension, the patient underwent total thyroidectomy via right video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) and cervical approach. The patient was positioned in left lateral decubitus with 3 ports placed: camera port in the 7th intercostal space in the mid axillary line, posterior port in the 6th intercostal space in the posterior axillary line behind the scapula tip, and working anterior port in the 4th intercostal space in the anterior axillary line. The goiter was dissected off the trachea, arch of aorta, superior vena cava, and innominate artery via the right VATS approach. A firm adherent 4 cm necrotic lymph node was found adjacent to the trachea and superior vena cava in the 4R location and dissected off the aorta, superior vena cava, and trachea. Intraoperative frozen section revealed carcinoma of unknown origin. Following this finding, the goiter was removed via neck incision by otolaryngology. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 1.
