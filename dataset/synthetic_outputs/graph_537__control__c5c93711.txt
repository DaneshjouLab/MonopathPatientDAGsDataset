A patient presented with lung adenocarcinoma, specifically ALK rearrangement non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), later confirmed as ALK-positive NSCLC. Initially, the patient experienced tumor shrinkage in response to treatment. However, the disease subsequently exhibited rapid progression. The patient developed symptoms including anorexia, dyspnea, dysphagia, cachexia, and diarrhea. Clinical findings included pleural effusion, grade 3 anemia, and an abdominal metastatic lymph node. The patient also reported dysgeusia. The progression of the ALK-positive NSCLC was associated with the development of secondary mutations of ALK, including ALK mutations. Genetic testing likely ruled out EGFR and KRAS mutations, and potentially investigated insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1R) and T790M. The emergence of secondary ALK mutations likely contributed to the rapid progression and resistance to initial therapies. The patient's condition deteriorated, marked by the development of malignancy and associated symptoms.
