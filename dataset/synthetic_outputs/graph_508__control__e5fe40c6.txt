The case report focuses on three patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring uncommon EGFR Exon 19 delins mutations. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a known driver gene in NSCLC, and common Exon 19 deletions (e.g., p.E746_A750 del) typically respond well to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, the optimal treatment strategies for NSCLC patients with uncommon Exon 19 delins mutations are less understood.

The researchers identified three novel EGFR Exon 19 mutations: p.E746_S752delinsI, p.T751_I759delinsG, and p.L747_S752delinsAA.

One patient with advanced NSCLC and the EGFR p.E746_S752delinsI mutation benefited from treatment with Icotinib.

Two other patients had early-stage NSCLC. One patient, harboring the p.T751_I759delinsG mutation, had an excellent recovery after receiving horacoscopic radical resection. The other patient, with the p.L747_S752delinsAA mutation, experienced a relapse after undergoing the same surgical procedure.

The study highlights that patients with different Exon 19 delins mutations may have varying prognoses. The report also emphasizes the importance of next-generation sequencing (NGS) as a crucial tool for guiding clinical treatment decisions in NSCLC, as it can increase the detection of EGFR del-ins mutations compared to older screening methods. The true incidence of these mutations is currently unknown, but routine use of NGS is expected to improve detection rates.
