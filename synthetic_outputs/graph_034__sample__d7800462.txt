In December 2021, a 60-year-old female presented with worsening cough and fever. This prompted a CT scan of the chest, which revealed a large right pulmonary upper lobe mass. The mass was surgically resected. Postoperative histologic examination was diagnostic for inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) with positive surgical margins and evidence of pleural invasion. The tumor was also found to be EML4-ALK-positive.

Three months post-surgery, the patient presented with fever, cough, and weight loss. CT and positron emission tomography confirmed locally recurrent disease and metastatic spread to the ileum, right supraclavicular fossa, and soft tissue of the right thigh. In March 2022, the ileal metastasis was surgically removed for symptomatic relief.

In February 2023, analysis of the primary (treatment-naive) tumor from the right upper lobe (RUL) lung showed enlarged nuclei, infiltrating lymphocytes and plasma cells visible on H&E staining. ALK immunohistochemical staining was positive.

By June 2023, a needle biopsy from the right supraclavicular fossa mass (crizotinib-resistant) showed metastasis. Metastasectomy of the right apical lung showed visible necrosis post-alectinib treatment.
