A middle-aged male with a history of stage IV mesothelioma and hepatitis C, who had been on chemotherapy for mesothelioma for 15 months, presented to the emergency department with acute abdominal pain and distension. His vitals were: blood pressure 113/81 mmHg, temperature 98Â°F, heart rate 112 bpm, respiratory rate 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 90% on room air. His chest was clear bilaterally, but his abdomen was distended and tensed due to ascites. An abdominal paracentesis was performed to alleviate the abdominal distension. Subsequent testing revealed an underlying COVID-19 infection. A COVID-19 PCR test was positive. A chest CT scan revealed ground-glass opacities and a large lobulated circumferential mass filling the left hemithorax with multifocal extensions and hilar, tracheobronchial and subcarinal lymphadenopathy. The chest CT also showed multifocal extensions through the diaphragm, chest wall and mediastinal fats, residual circumferential hypodense pleural thickening involving the mediastinal, costal and diaphragmatic pleural surfaces, and erosion of the inner aspect of multiple ribs. The left lung was inflated with fibroelastic bands, indicative of stage IV mesothelioma. The patient complained of acute abdominal pain and heaviness. Based on the imaging and positive COVID-19 PCR, the patient was moved to the isolation ward. Following transfer to the isolation ward, an ascitic tap (paracentesis) was performed again, leading to abatement of clinical symptoms. The patient was prescribed azithromycin (500 mg once daily), hydroxychloroquine (200 mg twice daily), cetirizine (10 mg once daily), paracetamol (500 mg thrice daily), cosome (2 teaspoons full thrice daily) and aldactone (100 mg once daily). Following paracentesis and medication administration, the patient remains well to date, with no need for ventilation or oxygenation.
