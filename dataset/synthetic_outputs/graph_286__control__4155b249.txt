Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and lung cancer are among the most prevalent causes of death worldwide, representing substantial public health challenges. The relationship between coronary artery disease (CAD) and lung cancer is potentially multifaceted, influenced by common risk factors and the adverse cardiac effects of cancer treatments.

We present a case of a Black American male undergoing combination therapy (chemotherapy/radiotherapy/immunotherapy) for small-cell lung cancer, who developed ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) seven months after beginning treatment.

This study underscores the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for acute coronary syndromes (ACS) in patients receiving lung cancer treatments, emphasizes the need for early recognition of warning signs, and highlights the critical role of risk factor management and enhanced surveillance in this vulnerable population.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and lung cancer are two leading causes of death globally, representing significant public health challenges. CVD encompasses a wide range of conditions, including coronary artery disease (CAD), heart failure (HF), arrhythmias, valvular heart diseases, and chronic cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism.
