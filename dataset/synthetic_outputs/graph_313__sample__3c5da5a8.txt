A 56-year-old female presented with right chest discomfort for 3 months. A chest CT revealed a 1.9 cm Ã— 2.1 cm mass in the anterior segment of the right upper lobe, multiple nodules in the bilateral lungs, and right pleural effusion. Enlarged right hilar, mediastinal, and paratracheal lymph nodes (LNs) were also found. A right supraclavicular painless lymph node was palpated (soybean size). Serum carcinoembryonic antigen level was 279.6 ng/mL. A PET scan showed increased FDG uptake in the right upper lobe mass, multiple pulmonary and subpleural nodules, right supraclavicular, mediastinal, and right hilar lymph nodes. Hypermetabolic nodules with low density were noted in segment 6 and the anterolateral area of the liver capsule. Multiple bone destruction changes and high FDG uptake were seen in the T7 and T8 vertebral bodies and appendages, L5 spinous processes, and bilateral iliac bones. A brain MRI was negative. The patient underwent ultrasound-guided needle biopsy of the right supraclavicular lymph node and right closed thoracic drainage. Endobronchial ultrasound-transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) was performed on LN 7 and 11R. Cancer cells were found both in the pleural effusion and clavicular lymph nodes. Pathological results of LN 11R identified pulmonary adenocarcinoma, with P40 (-), CK7 (+), TTF-1 (+), Napsin A (+), CK5/6 (-), ALK Ventana (-), ALK-Negative (-) through immunohistochemistry (IHC). Genetic testing was performed on cell block samples from pleural effusion by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Molecular genetic testing (EGFR, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, HER2, MET, PIK3CA, ALK, RET, ROS1) were all negative. The diagnosis was driver gene-negative right lung adenocarcinoma, cT1cN3M1c (TNM 8th Edition), stage IVB. The patient started chemotherapy with pemetrexed plus carboplatin and bevacizumab in September 2020.
