A 68-year-old non-smoking female patient presented with a near-missed case of occupational pleural malignant mesothelioma. The etiology of malignant mesothelioma is related to exposure to mineral fibers, especially asbestos fibers. Asbestos fibers reach the pleural space where they accumulate, with a subsequent potential risk of inducing pleural fibrosis and tumors. The latency time between the first asbestos exposure and the diagnosis of occupational pleural malignant mesothelioma was 49 years. Malignant mesothelioma has a long latency time (in some cases up to 50–60 years), so the risks related to asbestos exposure should not be forgotten. Increased risk of lung cancer following the inhalation of asbestos fibers, lifetime health monitoring should be considered in people occupationally exposed to asbestos, with an emphasis on the respiratory system. Malignant mesothelioma is a rare and aggressive form of cancer, with a world standardized incidence rate (WSIR) per 100,000 persons in Europe of 1.7 for males and 0.4 for females. Malignant mesothelioma is most frequently located at the pleural level, with approximately 60–70% of cases, followed by the peritoneal (30%) and pericardial (1–2%) localization. It is estimated that 43,000 patients diagnosed with malignant pleural mesothelioma die annually, of which over 10,000 cases are registered in North America, Western Europe, Australia, and Japan. The purpose of this report is to present a nearly missed case of occupational pleural malignant mesothelioma that resulted from a lack of measures to prevent asbestos exposure in the workplace atmosphere; due to a very long latency, the occupational history was overlooked. The patient also had essential hypertension.
