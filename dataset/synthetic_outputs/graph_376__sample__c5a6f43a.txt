A 66-year-old male with a 40 pack-year smoking history and sporadic alcohol consumption presented to the emergency department with sudden dyspnea in the middle of the night. He denied prior dyspnea, reporting only a mild productive cough typical for him due to his smoking. He denied chest pain, palpitations, dizziness, syncope, peripheral edema, or other respiratory, gastrointestinal, or urinary complaints. He was tachypneic with signs of respiratory distress.

Vitals showed a blood pressure of 154/84 mmHg, heart rate of 110 beats/minute, and normal body temperature. Pulmonary auscultation revealed crackles in both lungs, from base to apex, with severe wheezing. No venous jugular turgescence or peripheral edema was noted. Arterial blood gas (ABG) revealed type II respiratory failure with acidemia: hypoxemia with pO2 of 56 mmHg, severe hypercapnia with pCO2 of 75 mmHg, and respiratory acidemia with pH 7.069.

An ECG showed occasional ventricular premature beats and new-onset ST-segment depression in inferior leads. Chest X-ray revealed pulmonary congestion. CBC showed mild leukocytosis of 13,450 leukocytes/\u00b5L (reference range: 4,000-12,000 leukocytes/\u00b5L). Chemistry showed mildly elevated liver enzymes, serum creatinine of 1.27 mg/dL (eGFR: 56 mL/minute), and normal CRP. High-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) initially measured at 365 ng/L, rising to 7,493 ng/L three hours later (reference value: <34 ng/L). BNP was 1,318 pg/mL (reference value: <100 pg/mL).

Respiratory virus search (influenza and respiratory syncytial virus) was negative. Transthoracic echocardiogram displayed severely compromised left ventricular function with global hypokinesis and right ventricular function in the lower limit of normal. He was diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction Killip III. He was treated with noninvasive ventilation and a high dosage of intravenous furosemide, resulting in resolution of pulmonary congestion and respiratory failure in 48 hours. The patient remained electrically and hemodynamically stable.

hs-cTn peaked at 19,000 ng/L, with a subsequent fall in the following few days. Cardiac catheterization showed 60% obstruction of the anterior descending artery and 60% of the circumflex artery. Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy did not display a reversible component of these lesions. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) confirmed the global hypokinesis and showed myocardial late gadolinium enhancement in the heart septum, compatible with nonischemic cardiomyopathy.

The etiology of the ventricular dysfunction was interpreted as possible alcoholic cardiomyopathy with superimposed ischemic acute changes. The patient was discharged to the outpatient clinic.

At the first outpatient appointment, the patient was asymptomatic and had resumed his normal life. A persistent rise in eosinophils was noted in his blood work, which had started during the time he spent in the infirmary, but since it was mild and not associated with an obvious cause, it was dismissed.

Since hospital discharge, the patient experienced a progressive increase in eosinophil count, reaching 40,000 eosinophils/uL. Autoimmune panel showed near-normal sedimentation rate of 30 mm/hour, normal proteinogram and immunoglobulin panel except for elevated IgE of 2.
