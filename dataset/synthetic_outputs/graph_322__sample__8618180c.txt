A 43-year-old man with a history of smoking (Brinkman index: 460) presented to the hospital with persistent left chest pain. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a mass in the left upper lobe. The patient underwent left upper lobe lung resection. The resected tumor was composed of poorly differentiated carcinoma and partly composed of a glandular structure. Immunohistochemical staining showed TTF\u20101 (SP141) negative, SMARCA2 (HPA029981) partial loss, SMARCA4 (EPNCIR111A) loss, and PD\u2010L1 (28\u20108) 0%. The patient was diagnosed with SMARCA4\u2010deficient poorly differentiated lung adenocarcinoma, pathological stage T4N0M0 stage IIIA. Next-generation sequencing (Oncomine Cancer Research Panel) showed an absence of driver alterations for lung cancer. Whole-exon sequencing revealed a tumor mutation burden (TMB) at 396 mutations. Two months after surgery, multiple lung metastases rapidly developed, and the patient was diagnosed with recurrence. He was treated with four cycles of carboplatin (AUC 5\u20136, day 1), paclitaxel (180\u2010200 mg/m2, day 1), and bevacizumab (15 mg/kg, day 1), with a best overall response of stable disease. This was followed by four cycles of docetaxel (50\u201060 mg/m2, day 1) and ramucirumab (10 mg/kg, day 1), again with a best overall response of stable disease. After two cycles of pemetrexed (500 mg/m2, day 1; best overall response: progressive disease), nivolumab (3 mg/kg, day 1, every 2 weeks) was administered as a fourth\u2010line treatment.
