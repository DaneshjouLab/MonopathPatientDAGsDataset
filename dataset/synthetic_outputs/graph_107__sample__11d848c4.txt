A 74-year-old Japanese man with a history of interstitial pneumonia presented with a one-month history of right-sided chest pain that worsened with inspiration. He also experienced hyperhidrosis in the right arm and thoracic area accompanied by a cold sensation. He reported no abnormal sensation or muscle weakness in the same area. The sweating was so severe that he slept with a towel on the right side of his body and changed his pajamas at night.

Six months prior to admission, a chest CT scan showed dense infiltrations mainly below the ventral subpleural area in the right upper lobe and right middle lobe.

On admission, chest CT shadows were enlarged compared to the scan six months prior. Exacerbation of chronic lung inflammation or organizing pneumonia was suspected. The shadows did not improve with oral antibiotic therapy.

On admission physical examination revealed profuse sweating in the right arm and thoracic area. His blood pressure was 150/78 mmHg, pulse rate 71 beats/min, respiratory rate 20 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. A pleural friction rub was heard in the right chest. The skin on the right side of the arm, chest, and back was moister and cooler than that on the left side. Thermography revealed a decrease in body surface temperature on his right arm and on the right side of his chest and back, corresponding to the dermatomes of approximately C5-T12.
