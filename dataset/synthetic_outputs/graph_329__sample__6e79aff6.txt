A 62-year-old woman was diagnosed in September 2019 with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma with bilateral lung and lymph node involvement. The tumor was EGFR mutation (Ex19Del) positive. In September 2019, she started treatment with osimertinib at 80 mg/day. Subsequently, the patient was admitted for grade III cardiac, hepatic, and pulmonary toxicity (pericarditis, pneumonitis, and alteration of the hepatic profile) requiring treatment with NSAIDs and colchicine. Osimertinib dosage was readjusted to 40 mg/day. The cardiology department monitored the patient with adequate tolerance and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). In February 2021, a liver lesion was found with partial response in the rest of the sites. She underwent laparoscopic non-anatomical resection of segment III of the liver and continued treatment with osimertinib at 40 mg/day. In November 2021, a cranial CAT scan showed a selar lesion, suggesting a metastatic lesion by MRI. The patient on treatment with osimertinib developed fulminant myocarditis after receiving the third dose of COVID-19 Moderna vaccine. The patient consulted for fever (39.0 \u00b0C) at home, intense asthenia and hypotension (50/30 mmHg). Examination revealed sinus tachycardia (150 bpm) and skin pallor. The patient mentioned vaccination the previous day with a third dose of vaccine (Moderna) against COVID-19 and influenza and the onset of symptoms that morning. Intensive fluidtherapy was started with no clinical improvement. Urgent laboratory tests showed slight alterations in renal and hepatic function parameters and no elevation of acute phase reactants. ECG showed sinus tachycardia with no signs of acute ischaemia. Myocardial damage markers (MDM) were
