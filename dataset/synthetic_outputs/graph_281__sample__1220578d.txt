A patient with a history of lung cancer (cT4cN1cM1) diagnosed two years prior, underwent treatment including surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy, and three rounds of radiation therapy for bone metastasis in the left scapula. Two years after the initial diagnosis, the patient presented to the emergency department with angina pectoris. On admission, blood tests revealed elevated high-sensitivity troponin and CK levels, leading to a diagnosis of ST-elevation AMI. A coronary angiogram showed total occlusion of the distal LAD, and attempts to wire the occluded vessel were unsuccessful. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed invasion of the heart apex by the metastatic tumor, with localized thickening of the apical left ventricular wall and localized wall motion asynergy. Review of previous CT images confirmed tumor infiltration into the left ventricular apex. Due to the palliative situation, a decision was made against further revascularization strategies. The patient underwent radiotherapy once more but unfortunately passed away a few days after the hospital stay.
