A patient presented to Shenzhen Nanshan District Shekou People’s Hospital on November 18, 2020, with cough and expectoration following a cold. A chest CT on the same day revealed a nodule in the right lobe of the lung. The patient returned to the hospital on June 13, 2021, for the same reason. A subsequent chest CT revealed more lesions in the upper lobe of the right lung than before, with significant enlargement of the mediastinal lymph nodes, suggesting likely peripheral lung cancer. The patient was hospitalized on June 16, 2021. A chest CT on June 17, 2021, showed a 19×16×30 mm nodular shadow in the anterior segment of the upper lobe of the right lung, adjacent pleural involvement, and multiple enlarged lymph nodes at 2R and 4R/L in the right hilar and mediastinum. On June 21, 2021, lymph nodes were enlarged to 21 mm, narrowing the superior vena cava lumen, suggesting lymph node metastasis. Ultrasonic bronchoscopy revealed multiple hypoechoic masses in the 4R, 4L, and 7 areas of the mediastinum, right hilar (10R) and right interlobular (11R). The largest lesion was in area 4R, measuring 20.4×30.6 mm. Metastatic lymph node of 4R region (the largest short lymph nodes is 20.4×30.6 mm). Metastatic lymph node of 11R region (the largest short lymph nodes is 12.9×21.6 mm) with blood flow signal.
