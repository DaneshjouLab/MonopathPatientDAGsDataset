A 50-year-old man was referred to the interventional pulmonary department from the oncology department. He was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma with an N3 category. His PD-L1 expression was 90%, and he received pembrolizumab as first-line treatment. The lung cancer was diagnosed through a biopsy from the main lesion, with access from the esophagus, through transbronchial needle aspiration with EBUS, under general anesthesia and intubation.
