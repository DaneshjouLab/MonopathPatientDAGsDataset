A 53-year-old male was found to have right lung nodules 5 months prior to presentation. A contrast-enhanced CT scan on March 26, 2023, revealed a 10x9 mm solid nodule in the right upper lobe with irregular margins and an enlarged L4 lymph node in the mediastinum, suggesting metastasis. EBUS-TBNA of the L4 lymph node revealed metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma, clinical stage IIIb (pT1N3M0). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed high PD-L1 expression (Tumor Proportion Score approximately 70%). High-throughput gene sequencing revealed 0.57% abundance of EML4-ALK (E18: A20) gene fusion and 1.09% TP53 gene mutation (NM_000546Exon 8 c.818G>C p.R273P). The patient received 1 cycle of chemotherapy with paclitaxel 430 mg and nedaplatin 120 mg on April 1, 2023, followed by maintenance treatment with lorlatinib (100 mg per day until June 8, 2023). A CT scan on May 6, 2023, showed the nodule beneath the pleura had decreased in size from 10x9 mm to 5x4 mm, and the R10 and L4 lymph nodes also had become smaller.
