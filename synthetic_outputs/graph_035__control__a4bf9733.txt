A 78-year-old male patient with a 25-pack-year smoking history was diagnosed with clinical stage IIA lung cancer in the left upper lobe. Subsequently, he underwent lobectomy combined with chest wall resection. Histopathological examination indicated pleomorphic carcinoma of the lung (pT3N0M0, stage IIB, with chest wall invasion). The tumor was positive for the BRAF-V600E mutation in the AmoyDx pan lung cancer PCR panel, with a 95% tumor proportion score of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) staining. He underwent lobectomy and was pathologically diagnosed with PPC harboring a BRAF-V600E mutation. His lung cancer recurred two months postoperatively with multiple metastases, including those in the small intestine, which caused intussusception and ileus. Because the resected specimen from the small intestinal tumor resembled the histopathological results of the preoperative lung tissue, treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib could be effective.
