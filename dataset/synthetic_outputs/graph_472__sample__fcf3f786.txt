A 72-year-old male with a past medical history of restless legs syndrome, morbid obesity, sleep apnea, peripheral neuropathy, coronary artery disease due to a congenital split of the left anterior descending artery status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with a stent, hyperlipidemia, prior L5-S1 spinal fusion, left knee arthroplasty, bilateral hip arthroplasties, and bilateral shoulder arthroplasty presented to the ED in October with pleuritic chest pain and active left lower extremity cellulitis. The cellulitis had developed in July, recurred in August, and antibiotics were restarted. In September, the patient had worsening cellulitis symptoms and was placed on daptomycin, dicloxacillin, and vancomycin. The patient subsequently developed a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line infection, and his antibiotic regimen was changed to daptomycin and ceftazidime. He then presented to the ED with new chest pain described as left-sided, non-radiating pressure, exertional and pleuritic in nature, associated with shortness of breath. He was tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 36 but afebrile and normotensive. Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with a right bundle branch block. Troponins and comprehensive metabolic panel were normal. Complete blood count showed eosinophilia at 7.0% and absolute eosinophil count elevated at 0.64x10(9)/L. Complete blood count results: Leukocytes 9.1 x10(9)/L, Erythrocytes 4.49 x10(12)/L, Hemoglobin 12.8 g/dL (Low), Hematocrit 39.3 %, MCV 87.5 fL, MCH 28.5 pg, MCHC 32.6 g/dL, RDW CV 14.3 %, RDW SD 45.9 fL (High), Platelet Count 152 x10(9)/L, Mean Platelet Volume 9.9 fL, Neutrophils % 74.2 %, Immature Granulocytes % 0.3 %, Lymphocytes % 10.5 % (Low), Monocytes % 7.7 %, Eosinophils % 7.0 % (High), Basophils % 0.3 %, Neutrophils 6.74 x10(9)/L (High), Lymphocytes 0.96 x10(9)/L, Monocytes 0.70 x10(9)/L, Eosinophils 0.64 x10(9)/L (High), Basophils 0.03 x10(9)/L. CT angiogram showed a 26 mm spiculated nodule in the left upper lobe with adjacent irregular pleural thickening.
