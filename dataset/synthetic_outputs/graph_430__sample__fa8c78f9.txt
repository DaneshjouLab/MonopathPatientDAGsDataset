A patient presented with acute severe leg and back pain. The patient's medical history included a prior surgical removal of a right breast tumor that was presumed benign. The patient also had a significant smoking history of 35 pack-years and a family history of lung cancer, with the patient's mother affected (unspecified) and a sister who died at age 51. The patient's symptoms had been worsening for the past 2 weeks.

A spinal MRI revealed extensive lesions concerning for metastases. A pathologic fracture at the eleventh thoracic vertebra (T11) was noted, with a pending pathologic fracture in the right femur. The patient was subsequently admitted to the hospital for further workup and imaging.

A thorax CT scan showed mass-like consolidation in the left lower lobe with adjacent satellite nodularity and interlobular septal thickening, multiple pulmonary nodules in the right lower lobe, and enlarged hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes.

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) and chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) revealed a hot-spot KRAS exon 2 p.G12D mutation and 7 DNA copy-number aberrations (CNAs) in primary and metastatic tumor specimens, along with 7 CNAs exclusive to the metastatic tumor specimen.

A brain MRI demonstrated multifocal metastatic disease of the calvarium, infundibular masses, and a clival lesion.
