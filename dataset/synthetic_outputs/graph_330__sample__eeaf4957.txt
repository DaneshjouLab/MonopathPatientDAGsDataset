A 57-year-old woman presented with a 3-week history of dry cough and intermittent chest wall and back pain. The pain had gradually worsened, leading to decreased daily physical activity. Over the past month, she experienced a 3kg unintentional weight loss. Physical examination revealed swollen bilateral supraclavicular lymph nodes.

A chest CT scan revealed over 200 uniform size pulmonary nodules evenly dispersed in both lungs, a 38x45mm mass in the dorsal segment of the left lung's lower lobe, and a small amount of left-sided pleural and pericardial effusion.

Further enhanced CT scanning revealed multiple liver and adrenal metastases, multiple bone metastases (including thoracic spine, sternum, ribs and left scapula), as well as lymphadenopathy in the left hilar, bilateral mediastinal and retroperitoneal area. MRI revealed multiple osteolytic bone destruction in thoracic vertebrae and a T7 vertebral bodyâ€™s compression fracture. T-SPOT was negative. Serum tumor markers were significantly elevated: CEA 839.30 ng/mL, NSE 60.38 ng/mL, Cyfra 21-1 20.11 ng/mL, CA125 466.70 U/mL, CA153 181.00 ng/mL, CA199 74.16 ng/mL and CA724 151.40 ng/mL.

A biopsy of the left supraclavicular node confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma with immunohistochemical staining reaction: TTF-1 positive, PCK positive, CK7 positive, P40 negative, Syn negative, Ki 67 index 70%.

Peripheral blood gene detection showed wild-type EGFR with no gene mutation sites. A diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma (T4N3M1 stage IV), EGFR-negative was made. 16-Slice computed tomography scans showed a blocky mass in the left lung and uniform miliary nodules dispersed all lung lobes. Artificial intelligence (AI) system identified one high-risk nodule and 17 low-risk nodules.

The patient underwent combination therapy. Follow-up imaging showed a significant decrease in the size and number of primary tumors and metastases. The primary tumor size significantly decreased, and the miliary lung metastasis almost wholly disappeared on 16-slice computed tomography. Axial and coronal view CT examination revealed a homogeneously distributed pattern of miliary nodules in all lobes of the left and right lungs.

3D CT reconstruction revealed the stereometric and 3D structure of all nodules and the relationship between vessels and the distribution of the nodules in the lung lobes.
