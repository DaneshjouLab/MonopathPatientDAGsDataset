A patient was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma. Genetic testing revealed the presence of a rare EGFR L747_A755delinsSKD mutation, along with co-occurring T790M and trans-C797S mutations. The patient was treated with a combination therapy of first- and third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and showed a positive response. A biopsy of a lesion obtained under tracheoscopy confirmed the histological diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma.
