A 75-year-old woman presented with cough and chest pain for three months. Chest radiography revealed left pleural effusion. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed massive left pleural effusion causing atelectasis in the upper and lower lobes. Pleural effusion pathological examination revealed adenocarcinoma. She was diagnosed with stage IVB (cT2bN3M1b) lung adenocarcinoma with multiple metastases to the internal thoracic lymph nodes, abdominal lymph nodes, peritoneum, adrenal glands, lumbar vertebrae, and the skin. Genetic alterations in the epidermal growth factor receptor, anaplastic lymphoma kinase, and c-ros oncogene 1 were negative. Immunohistological examination revealed a low PD-L1 expression, with a tumor proportion score of 1%. Her ECOG performance status score was 1. She was treated with combined immunochemotherapy consisting of nivolumab (360 mg/body on day 1, every 3 weeks), ipilimumab (1 mg/kg on day 1, every 6 weeks), carboplatin (75 mg/m2on day 1, every 3 weeks up to 2 courses), and paclitaxel (200 mg/m2on day 1, every 3 weeks up to 2 courses). Eleven days after the first dose of chemotherapy, the patient developed erythema throughout her entire body. She was diagnosed with a skin rash associated with irAEs, which was subsequently treated with a steroid cream. She was admitted to the hospital, and high-resolution computed tomography and contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed left pleural effusion and atelectasis in the upper and lower lobes.
