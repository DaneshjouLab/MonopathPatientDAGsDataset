A patient with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), specifically lung squamous cell carcinoma, initially presented with superior vena cava syndrome and mediastinal lymph nodes involvement, indicating lymph node metastases. The patient also developed carcinomatous pericarditis, affecting the pericardium. The patient had adrenal metastasis as well. Initial treatment involved chemoradiotherapy, including thoracic radiotherapy. Later, the patient received palliative radiotherapy.

Following initial treatment, the patient was treated with atezolizumab, an anti-programmed death 1 ligand 1 (anti-PD-L1) antibody targeting PD-L1, as well as docetaxel. Subsequently, the patient developed radiation recall dermatitis, characterized by dermatitis and erythema in the previously irradiated area. Histopathological examination revealed interface dermatitis and perivascular lymphocytic inflammatory cell infiltration.

The radiation recall dermatitis was initially managed with dexamethasone and steroid therapy. However, the patient's condition worsened, developing erythema multiforme minor, lichenoid, and eczematous dermatitis. The patient was then treated with methylprednisolone.

The patient's case highlights the potential for immune-related adverse events (irAEs) associated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies like atezolizumab, durvalamb, and nivolumab (anti-PD-1 antibody), even after prior cytotoxic anticancer agents. The differential diagnosis included autoimmune disorders and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. The case illustrates the importance of recognizing and managing radiation recall dermatitis in patients receiving PD-1/programmed cell death-1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death ligand-1 (programmed cell death ligand-1) inhibitors.
