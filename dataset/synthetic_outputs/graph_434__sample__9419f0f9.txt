A 55-year-old female presented for surgical intervention and underwent a modified radical mastectomy in the left breast. Pathological examination of the mastectomy specimen revealed invasive ductal carcinoma, WHO grade III. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed positive expression of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR), focal positivity for PS2, and negativity for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2). Ki67 proliferation index was approximately 20%. Further evaluation revealed metastatic spread in left axillary lymph nodes (7/18 sampled positive) and left subclavian lymph nodes (1/2 sampled positive). The patient received adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy directed at the left chest wall and supraclavicular area. Subsequently, the patient underwent oophorectomy to reduce estrogen levels, followed by 5 years of endocrine therapy due to hormone receptor-positive cancer. Postoperative evaluations indicated no signs of residual lesions, confirming complete disease remission. Years later, physical examination revealed nodules in the upper left lung. A CT scan was performed to evaluate the pulmonary nodules, suggesting a 3.3 x 2.4 cm solid nodule in the upper lobe of the left lung. The patient then underwent video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) with left upper lobectomy and lymph node dissection, followed by post-surgical follow-up and management.
