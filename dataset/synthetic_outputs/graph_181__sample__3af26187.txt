In December 2007, a 46-year-old male non-smoker presented with right supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. An excisional biopsy of the right supraclavicular lymph node was performed. Histopathology showed small cell lung cancer (SCLC) with small to medium size cells, high nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio, salt and pepper chromatin with inconspicuous nucleoli, nuclear molding, and high mitotic activity. Immunostaining of the lymph node biopsy showed the tumor cells expressed synaptophysin and chromogranin and discontinuous cytokeratin markers. TTF-1 was also positive. Imaging was performed with PET/CT showing a 5 cm right hilar mass and right paratracheal lymphadenopathy and no disease elsewhere including a negative brain MRI. PD-L1 immunostain was negative in the initial biopsy and subsequent biopsied metastatic sites. The patient was diagnosed with limited stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC). The patient was treated with cisplatin and etoposide and concurrent radiation therapy. The patient achieved a complete response after 6 cycles of chemotherapy and subsequently underwent prophylactic cranial irradiation. The patient was monitored clinically and by imaging every 3 months. In May 2009, the disease relapsed with left supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, confirmed by excisional biopsy. The patient underwent radiation therapy with concurrent cisplatin and etoposide for 2 cycles, followed by 4 cycles of oral topotecan. The patient had a complete response again that lasted for one year.
