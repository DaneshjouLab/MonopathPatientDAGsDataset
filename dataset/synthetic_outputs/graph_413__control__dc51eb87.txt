A 50-year-old man presented with a cancerous-type lesion on radiological findings and atypical symptoms that led to an initial diagnosis of lung cancer. However, histopathology and biopsy of the lung lesion revealed chronic granulomatous inflammation with caseous necrosis, confirming pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) as the true cause, with no further indications of malignancy. Pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) was initially misdiagnosed as cancer. Misdiagnosis of TB frequently leads to unwarranted diagnostic procedures and postpones the start of treatment.
