A 59-year-old female patient presented to the emergency department with new onset seizures and abdominal pain. She had been diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) 11 months prior, while being evaluated for seizures. She received six weeks of low-dose radiation with concomitant temozolomide administration (115mg/day oral daily), which was discontinued due to refractory pancytopenia. The patient was currently on bevacizumab. The patient's husband reported that she complained of significant abdominal pain the night before presentation. On her way to the hospital, the patient had three seizure episodes and was treated with benzodiazepines in the emergency room. On physical exam, the patient had abdominal tenderness with distention, rigidity, and guarding alongside neurological findings. Labs showed normal complete blood count levels with a basic metabolic panel (BMP) which was significant for low bicarbonate (19 mEq/L, normal range: 23-29 mEq/L) and mild elevation of high sensitivity troponin I (71 pg/mL, normal range: 0-12 pg/mL). Stat CT imaging of the abdomen revealed a large amount of retroperitoneal air, and some intraperitoneal air extending to the mediastinum. The patient was diagnosed with an intestinal perforation. No evidence of hemorrhage or obstructive hydrocephalus was found. Gastrointestinal perforation is a serious and often fatal adverse event related to bevacizumab use.
