A patient in his late 60s presented with a week history of painful blisters on the tips of fingers on both hands. Physical examination revealed poor dentition and dusky skin of distal fingers. Vitals were as follows: afebrile, blood pressure of 147/71 mm Hg, heart rate of 90 beats/min, respiratory rate of 17 breaths/min, with oxygen saturation of 100% on room air.

The patient transitioned from initial presentation to showing necrotic-appearing skin on the second digits of both hands, without obvious drainage. Labs were notable for Haemoglobin 10.7, platelet count 218, ESR 71 mm/hour, CRP 4.4 mg/dL, prothrombin time 14.8, INR 1.1, fibrinogen 500 mg/dL. Urine drug screen was positive for cocaine and amphetamines.

Serologies for autoimmune disease, complement levels, neutrophil myeloperoxidase antibodies, neutrophil proteinase 3 antibodies, anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody and cryoglobulin studies were unremarkable. HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C tests were negative.

The patient underwent CT angiography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. CT angiography showed no occlusive disease of upper extremities but incidentally revealed a cavitary mass in the right lower lobe of the lung. Endobronchial biopsy was performed.

Endobronchial biopsy showed adenocarcinoma of the lung. Full body CT and positron emission tomography were performed. Full body CT and positron emission tomography showed stage IIIB adenocarcinoma with metastatic involvement of numerous hilar, mediastinal, and supraclavicular lymph nodes, as well as a subpleural nodule in the right lower lobe. The patient had plans to initiate chemotherapy, but suffered a stroke several weeks after initial presentation. The patient elected to go to hospice and passed away prior to receiving chemotherapy.
