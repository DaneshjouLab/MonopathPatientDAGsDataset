A 57-year-old Japanese woman presented with a left parotid tumor and an enlarged left supraclavicular fossa lymph node. Aspiration cytology of the lymph node revealed adenocarcinoma. Her carcinoembryonic antigen level was significantly elevated at 2,058 \u00b5g/L. A CT scan of the chest revealed a 25 \u00d7 14 mm nodular shadow in the right S5 lobe, along with enlarged pulmonary hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes with extensive calcification. Transbronchial lung biopsy of the right S5 nodule revealed an infiltrative proliferation of atypical cells with mutual adhesion and glandular cavity formation. Immunohistochemical staining revealed positive thyroid transcription factor-1 and negative p40, consistent with lung adenocarcinoma. An AmoyDx\u00ae Pan Lung Cancer PCR Panel detected ROS1 fusions. Positron emission tomography-CT showed fluorodeoxyglucose accumulation in the contralateral hilar lymph node. Based on these findings, she was diagnosed with stage IIIB lung adenocarcinoma (cT1cN3M0) according to the 8th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system. Treatment was initiated with crizotinib (250 mg, twice daily) orally. On day 12 of treatment, the patient developed grade 2 neutropenia, prompting a dose reduction of crizotinib to 200 mg twice daily.
