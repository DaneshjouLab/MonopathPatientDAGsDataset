After 19 cycles of durvalumab (July 1, 2023), the patient experienced seizures characterized by loss of consciousness, convulsions, foaming at the mouth, and clenched teeth lasting for approximately 1 min. Subsequently, progressive cognitive decline, increased sleep, decreased speech, and olfactory hallucinations occurred. Considering the possibility of encephalitis and paraneoplastic syndrome, CSF and serum samples were sent to the testing center for analysis. On the basis of these results, the patient was diagnosed with durvalumab-induced anti-GABA<sub>B</sub>R antibody-associated encephalitis. The patient finally died on November 2023 owing to pancreatic metastasis from SCLC. Following the completion of the second treatment cycle, the patient experienced weakness and numbness in the upper limbs, progressively worsening symptoms, an inability to stand or walk, and difficulty in making a fist with both hands. Based on these results, the diagnosis was anti-Hu positivity associated with adebrelimab-induced paraneoplastic neuropathy.
