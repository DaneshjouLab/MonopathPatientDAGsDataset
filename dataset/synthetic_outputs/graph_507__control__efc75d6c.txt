A 70-year-old Japanese man experienced occasional pain in the right side of the chest and dyspnea. He was diagnosed with malignant pleural mesothelioma and referred to our hospital. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed diffuse irregular right pleural thickening. He underwent right extra-pleural pneumonectomy after three courses of induction chemotherapy. The right main bronchus was cut using a scalpel. The mucosal surface of the bronchial stump was ablated with electrocautery (Monopolar Cut, blend, at 30 W × 30 W, for 1–2 seconds. Valleylab, ForceTriad™ Energy Platform) with a width of 1 mm. The bronchial stump was then sutured manually using 3-0 absorbable monofilament sutures (PDS® II, ETHICON, Inc., Somerville, NJ, USA.). The single ligation suturing technique was used with Sweet’s method. No bronchial fistula developed post-operatively. Four years after surgery, he died of recurrent malignant pleural mesothelioma, and he underwent autopsy. Macroscopic evaluation showed tight adhesions and white scars on the main bronchial stump and the intervals between the sutured stitches.
