A 71-year-old heavy smoker male patient (116PY), with a past medical history relevant for stage 1 COPD, presented to the emergency room with complaints of a 2-week diffuse abdominal pain, with no nausea, vomiting, GI transit disturbances, or changes in stool appearance associated. He additionally described a 13 kg weight loss over the past year. The patient presented with intestinal obstruction symptoms for which he underwent an emergency resection of the ileocecal MiNEN. An initial CT scan showed an additional lung mass later identified as an SQ-NSCLC after bronchoscopy biopsy analysis. Given the rapid hepatic metastatic progression, palliative platinum-based chemotherapy was initiated, with an adequate response of the local and metastatic lesions of the MiNEN, but suggested platinum resistance and progression of the pulmonary neoplasm. Second-line treatment with pembrolizumab directed for the SQ-NSCLC was initiated; however, it was stopped after immune-mediated toxicities developed. A third-line chemotherapy scheme with carboplatin/gemcitabine was initiated, but central nervous system (CNS) progression developed, with the patient dying 11 months after initial diagnosis.
