A 64-year-old male coal miner was admitted to the Gastroenterology department with a one-month history of increased abdominal girth, constipation, abdominal pain, and abdominal fullness. About 10 days after discharge, he was readmitted to the hospital due to abdominal pain and distention. Examination revealed signs of peritoneal irritation, including abdominal distention and rebound tenderness. Laboratory tests showed neutrophilic leukocytosis (WBC 19450/uL with 95.1% neutrophil) and increased CRP (372 mg/L). He underwent emergency surgery due to fecal discharge from the laparoscopic trocar insertion site. Spontaneous perforation was evident at the mesenteric border of the ileum 20 cm proximal to the caecum, and loop ileostomy was performed. The patient was diagnosed with Diffuse Malignant Peritoneal Mesothelioma (DMPM) causing spontaneous ileal perforation due to direct invasion. Malignant mesothelioma is a rare type of malignancy involving the serosal lining of the pleura, pericardium, peritoneum, and tunica vaginalis. Spontaneous perforation of the small intestine due to either direct invasion or metastasis from pleural mesothelioma and DMPM is quite rare in English written literature. According to the best of our knowledge, this is the first case reported in English written literature.
