In July 2019, a 67-year-old man presented with a persistent dry cough for more than 3 months. The patient had a 50-year smoking history, smoking 30 cigarettes a day. A contrast enhanced chest CT revealed a mass in the central left upper lobe, enlarged bilateral mediastinal lymph nodes and bilateral pulmonary nodules. Biopsy of the lesion under tracheoscopy confirmed lung adenocarcinoma histologically. A Whole Body Scan (WBS) showed macroscopic metastases in the bone, and the patient was clinically classified as stage IVB (T4N0M1c) NSCLC. Zoledronic acid was administered to control bone destruction. EGFR exon 19 deletion was detected by Amplification Refractory Mutation System Polymerase Chain Reaction (ARMS-PCR) in the tumor tissue. The patient began treatment with gefitinib 250 mg once daily, resulting in a radiological response and rapid clinical benefit lasting 11 months. Subsequently, tissue biopsy confirmed an acquired T790M mutation in exon 20 (c.2369C>T, frequency as 61.9%) via droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR). The patient was then switched to osimertinib 80mg once daily, achieving stable disease with shrinkage of hepatic lesions.
