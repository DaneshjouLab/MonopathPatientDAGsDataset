A 74-year-old Asian female was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the left lung with bone metastasis in August 2019. Treatment was initiated with EGFR-TKIs, including gefitinib and eclitinib. Due to disease progression, the patient started osimertinib 80 mg/day one year prior to presentation. Osimertinib was discontinued 9 months prior due to Torsades de pointes. Eight months prior, reexamination found lung tumor progression; osimertinib 80 mg/day was restarted with close potassium monitoring and oral potassium supplementation. In January 2022, due to resistance to osimertinib, combination therapy of osimertinib 80 mg/day and savolitinib 200 mg/12 hours was initiated after genetic testing. The patient subsequently developed chest tightness, shortness of breath, cough, and yellow and white sticky sputum. Chest tightness and shortness of breath worsened, with paroxysmal dyspnea occurring at night. The patient received anti-infection diuretic treatment at a health center with poor results. A chest CT scan showed anterior bronchial occlusion of the upper lobe of the left lung, lung cancer with obstructive pneumonia or atelectasis, extensive interstitial changes in both lungs, and partial consolidation in both lungs, more obvious in the right lung. The patient presented to the emergency department with blood oxygen saturation of 85%, CRP 96mg/L, cardiac ultrasound EF value 46%, and crackles in both lungs. She was diagnosed with severe pneumonia, respiratory failure, and heart failure. Further management and outcomes are pending.
