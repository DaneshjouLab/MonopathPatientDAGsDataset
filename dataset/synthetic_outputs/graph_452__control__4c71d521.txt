A patient was diagnosed with stage IV NSCLC, specifically lung squamous cell carcinoma, which had metastasized. The metastases included cardiac metastases, with evidence of both left atrial metastasis and left ventricular metastasis. The patient presented with a lung mass, later confirmed to be a lung tumor. The patient was initially treated with chemotherapy consisting of paclitaxel and cisplatin, along with supportive medications including glutathione and magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate.

Due to the advanced stage of the lung cancer, immunotherapy with sintilimab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, was initiated. During the course of sintilimab treatment, the patient developed immune-mediated hepatitis, evidenced by elevated alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase levels, representing an immune-related adverse event. Despite the immunotherapy, the patient continued to exhibit cardiac tumors and metastatic foci. The patient also suffered an ischemic infarction. The presence of tumor cells was confirmed in both the primary lung tumor and the cardiac metastases. The patient's condition continued to deteriorate despite treatment.
