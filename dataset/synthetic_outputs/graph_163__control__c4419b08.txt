A man in his 40s with recurrent malignant pleural mesothelioma was administered carboplatin (CBDCA) + pemetrexed (PEM) as a third-line treatment. He had a history of rarely experiencing mild akathisia-like symptoms on his feet before the diagnosis. He reported mild degradation of similar symptoms during a previous cisplatin (CDDP) + PEM treatment, which did not require pharmacotherapy.

Approximately 7 days after the first cycle of CBDCA + PEM, the patient's akathisia-like symptoms notably worsened and persisted. The symptoms were more pronounced during the daytime and lessened at night. Lorazepam (0.5 mg) was administered three times daily from day 14, but it proved ineffective.

The symptoms were attributed to CBDCA-induced neuropathy, given the patient's prior experience with similar symptoms during CDDP + PEM treatment and the absence of other potential causes of akathisia. Pregabalin 75 mg twice daily was initiated, resulting in significant symptom improvement. The patient reported symptom recurrence approximately 10 hours after each pregabalin dose, suggesting that the medication's effect diminished over time.

The patient experienced carboplatin (CBDCA)-induced akathisia-like CIPN, which was significantly attenuated by pregabalin administration.
