**Clinical Case Report: Respiratory Health Surveillance of Western Australian Mine Workers (2001-2012)**

This case report summarizes respiratory health surveillance data collected from 6,951 Western Australian mine workers between 2001 and 2012. The study population had a mean age of 35.8 years (SD 10.9), with 90.4% being men. A significant proportion (79.7%) worked 12-hour shifts. The majority of the cohort (6,563) were monitored once, while 178 were monitored twice, eight monitored three times, and two monitored four times during the study period.

Respiratory health surveillance was conducted using a standardized respiratory questionnaire, lung function testing, audiometric (hearing) testing, and chest x-rays in some cases. The respiratory questionnaire assessed current respiratory symptoms experienced in the last 3 months, including cough, phlegm, wheeze, breathlessness, and any other respiratory symptom.

Occupational details revealed that 52.4% of the subjects were engaged in underground mining activities, 29.3% in surface production, and 18.2% were managers. A concerning finding was that approximately 84% of mine workers reported not wearing a protective mask during dusty activities. 65.5% of the mine workers were non-smokers.

**Year-Specific Cohort Details:**

*   **2001:** The study included 410 mine workers with a mean age of 35.9 (SD 9.9). The cohort was predominantly male (93.4%), with 6.6% being female. Occupational roles were distributed as follows: 19.5% managers, 25.9% in surface production, and 54.6% in underground mining. Mask usage was low, with 89.0% reporting not wearing a mask and only 11.0% reporting mask use.

*   **2002:** The study included 558 mine workers with a mean age of 36.7 (SD 10.3). The cohort remained predominantly male (93.7%), with 6.3% being female. Occupational roles were: 17.0% managers, 23.8% in surface production, and 59.1% in underground mining. Mask usage remained low, with 88.9% reporting not wearing a mask and 11.1% reporting mask use.

*   **2003:** The study included 512 mine workers with a mean age of 36.8 (SD 10.4). The cohort composition was 7.4% female and 92.6% male. Occupational roles were: 20.7% managers, 23.4% in surface production, and 55.9% in underground mining. Mask usage was still low, with 81.2% reporting not wearing a mask and 18.8% reporting mask use.
