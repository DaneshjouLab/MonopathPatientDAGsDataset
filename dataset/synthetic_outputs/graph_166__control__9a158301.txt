A 48-year-old male presented to the emergency room for 2 weeks of joint pain and swelling of his four extremities. His symptoms started suddenly and were quite debilitating. His hands, fingers, knees, and ankles were so swollen and painful that he was unable to get out of bed and had to use crutches to ambulate. He also complained of anorexia, nausea, and lack of energy over the past few months, but denied any other complaints. His only medical history was a traumatic left tibia fracture 1 year ago. The patient recently had an arthrocentesis at an outside hospital which was non-diagnostic and showed no infection. Given his symptoms, a thorough rheumatic workup was ordered. The ESR and CRP were elevated. ANA, rheumatoid factor, HLA B27, HIV, hepatitis panel, TSH, T4, Coombs antibodies, gonorrhea, chlamydia, CCP, alpha 1 antitrypsin, parvovirus, fungal antibodies, and myeloperoxidase antibodies were all within the normal range.
