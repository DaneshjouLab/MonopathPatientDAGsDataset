Small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) is an aggressive solid tumor with a prognosis that has not significantly improved in 25 years. Approximately 13% or 29,000 of all lung cancers annually in the United States are SCLC. The vast majority of these patients are current or former smokers. SCLC is characterized by a high proliferation rate, rapid doubling time, and early development of distant metastases. Approximately 70 percent of patients present with overt metastatic disease. Limited stage (LS) disease, defined as tumor confined to one radiation field, is potentially curable with combination chemotherapy and radiation, but most patients will eventually relapse with distant disease and ultimately succumb to the disease. Even in patients who present with extensive stage disease (defined as disease spread beyond one radiation field), SCLC is almost uniformly responsive to initial chemotherapy and radiation therapy; however, early relapse is common. This case report presents a patient with SCLC harboring a novel MYCL1 fusion protein who experienced a prolonged disease course due to the use of Aurora A kinase inhibitor and subsequently nivolumab. MYC family genes are master regulators of several cellular pathways including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis and recently have been shown to be involved in tumor immune evasion. Large studies have shown that a significant proportion of patients with SCLC have amplification or overexpression of MYC family genes. Preclinical data have exposed vulnerability of MYC-driven tumors to Aurora kinase inhibitors, bromodomain and extraterminal domain inhibitors, and recently to immune checkpoint blockers.
