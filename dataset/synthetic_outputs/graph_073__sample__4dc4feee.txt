A 65-year-old male with a complex medical history including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (CD4 count 163 cells/mm3), asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, hepatitis C, prior history of tuberculosis (TB), substance abuse history, and recently diagnosed metastatic small cell lung cancer diagnosed via transthoracic lung biopsy and completed two cycles of chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide, was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with pneumonia and acute hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation. He subsequently developed septic shock and a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC-line)-associated methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia, which was treated with intravenous (IV) cefazolin. The patient then developed superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome and a left upper extremity deep vein thrombosis, for which he was treated with therapeutic enoxaparin. On hospital day 52, he experienced recurrent fevers and was transferred back to the ICU for septic shock management. Blood cultures again grew MSSA, and a transesophageal echocardiogram was negative for endocarditis. By hospital day 54, repeat blood cultures grew *A. fumigatus* in addition to MSSA. The infectious disease team recommended continuing IV cefazolin for MSSA bacteremia and adding caspofungin for fungal coverage. Atovaquone was continued for *pneumocystis jirovecii* prophylaxis. Tenofovir was discontinued due to concern for contributing to acute kidney injury, and the antiretroviral regimen was changed to dolutegravir/rilpivirine plus emtricitabine pending further evaluation of hepatitis B status. The patient remained ventilator-dependent and in septic shock on multiple vasopressors. His white blood cell count climbed from 15.1 k/uL to 30.9 k/uL over the next several days. A chest X-ray revealed bilateral airspace opacities suggestive of multifocal pneumonia or pulmonary edema but lacked the nodular lesions with surrounding ground-glass halos that are considered characteristic of early invasive aspergillosis. A chest CT showed no halo sign, no clear cavitary lesions, bilateral airspace opacities consistent with multifocal pneumonia or edema, and no significant pleural effusions. The patient died of his illness on hospital day 62.
