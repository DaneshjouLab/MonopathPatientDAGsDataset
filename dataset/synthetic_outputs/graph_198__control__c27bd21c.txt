A patient presented with abdominal pain, dark urine, nausea, vomiting, and jaundice, indicative of obstructive jaundice. Imaging revealed biliary dilatation and extrahepatic bile duct dilatation, suggesting biliary obstruction. Further investigation via endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) revealed extrinsic compression of the common bile duct (CBD) and a lesion at the ampulla of the duodenum, concerning for an ampullary tumour. A common bile duct (CBD) metal stent was placed to relieve the biliary obstruction.

The patient was diagnosed with pancreatitis, likely secondary to the biliary obstruction. Further investigation revealed the presence of a FDG-avid duodenal lesion, confirmed as duodenal metastasis. The patient was subsequently diagnosed with metastatic adenocarcinoma, specifically metastatic lung adenocarcinoma, originating from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The patient also had brain metastases.

The patient's clinical course involved common bile duct stenting to alleviate biliary obstruction and obstructive jaundice. The duodenal metastasis of NSCLC caused further biliary obstruction, leading to obstructive pancreatitis. A distal CBD fully uncovered metal stent was placed. The patient underwent further ERCP and biliary stent insertion to manage the recurrent biliary obstruction. The patient's overall condition was complicated by metastatic disease, including brain metastasis, stemming from the underlying lung cancer.
