A patient presented with endocrinological abnormalities suggesting secondary adrenal insufficiency, secondary hypothyroidism, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and growth hormone deficiency. An MRI revealed a dumbbell-type tumor of the pituitary gland with suprasellar extension. Corticosteroid replacement therapy was initiated, leading to an increase in urination that probably indicated polyuria, a decrease in the plasma ADH level, and an increase in the serum sodium concentration. The patient's blood urea nitrogen was 20 mg/dL (Reference range 8–21). Further lab values revealed: Creatinine 0.82 mg/dL (Reference range 0.65–1.07), Uric acid 4.0 mg/dL (Reference range 3.7–7.0), Sodium 128 mmol/L (Reference range 138–145), Potassium 4.4 mmol/L (Reference range 3.6–4.8), Chlorine 92 mmol/L (Reference range 101–108), Plasma osmotic pressure 292 mOsm/kg•H2O (Reference range 275–290), Urine osmolality 175 mOsm/kg•H2O (Reference range 50–1300), and Adrenocorticotropic hormone 1.1 pg/mL (Reference range 7.2–63.3).
