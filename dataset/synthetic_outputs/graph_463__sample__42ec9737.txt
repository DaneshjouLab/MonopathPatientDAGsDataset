A woman in her 60s presented with new onset perianal swellings associated with anal itching for 3 months, worsening constipation, and a slight increase in fatigue. Ten months prior, she underwent peritonectomy, omentectomy, hysteroadnexectomy, and subtotal colectomy plus hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy with cisplatin and doxorubicin for malignant peritoneal mesothelioma, epithelioid type. Adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin and pemetrexed was administered for 6 months after surgery. Physical exam revealed two subcentimeter, solid lesions in the perineal region: one at the right anterolateral quadrant and another at the anterior perianal quadrant near the vagina, without local inflammation. Lab tests showed no leucocytosis or systemic inflammation. Tumor markers were normal. Whole-body CT and pelvic MRI showed extraperitoneal thickening of the mesorectum surrounding the middle-lower rectum. A PET scan showed non-homogeneous increased uptake of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose in the mesorectum, with greater metabolic activity in the perineum and along the rectovaginal septum. No other pathological uptake was identified.
