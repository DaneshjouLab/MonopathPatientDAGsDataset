A 62-year-old gentleman with a history of COPD and recurrent episodes of shingles, who is on regular inhalers and an ex-smoker with a 40-pack year history, presented in October 2022 with an acute onset of chest pain and shortness of breath on his left side. A chest x-ray revealed a large left-sided secondary spontaneous pneumothorax. He was managed with chest drain insertion and hospital admission. The air leak settled within 4 days with full lung expansion confirmed on chest x-ray, and the decision was made to remove the drain. Two months later, the patient presented with a second episode of symptomatic pneumothorax on the left side, managed with a 12 Fr drain insertion and another hospital admission. A CT thorax showed a significant left-sided pneumothorax, bullous disease consistent with COPD, and a suspicious thickened left lateral bulla. Due to the persistent air leak, the thoracic surgery team was consulted for surgical intervention consideration. The decision was made to proceed with surgery, and the patient was transferred to the thoracic surgery unit. He underwent a left-sided anterior 3-port VATS upper lobe bullectomy and talc pleurodesis. Intraoperatively, bullae were appreciated at the lateral aspect of the upper lobe with adhesions present at the apex. Two bullae were resected from this region using a wedge resection, performed with an Endo GIA 40/60 stapler, and the apical adhesion was released; the lung tissue was found to be thick, making staple application challenging.
