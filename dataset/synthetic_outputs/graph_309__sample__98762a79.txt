A patient was admitted to the hospital presenting with impaired speech and stiff, bent lower limbs exhibiting high muscle tension. Physical examination revealed normal pupil reflections, eye movements, sensation, muscle strength, and muscle tension in both upper limbs. There were no signs of meningeal irritation. The patient had previously been prescribed clonazepam for lip pain, but this was discontinued six months prior to admission. Initial treatment focused on improving circulation, nourishing nerves, easing pain, relieving spasms, and providing sedation.

Laboratory tests revealed elevated carbohydrate antigen-199 (39.46 U/mL, normal range 0-39) and carbohydrate antigen-125 (103.00 U/ml, normal range 0-35). Urine analysis showed 3+ occult blood and 2+ ketone bodies. The patient tested positive for antinuclear antibody with a titer of 1:320 and was also positive for anti-PM-Scl antibody. Tests for rheumatism, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, thyroid function, blood routine, blood homocysteine levels, blood coagulation routine, electrolyte test, blood glucose analysis, liver function, and infectious markers showed no significant abnormalities. An electromyogram (EMG) also showed no obvious abnormalities. Biochemical, bacterial, and immune indexes of cerebrospinal fluid obtained via lumbar puncture were within normal limits.

Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with stiff-person syndrome (SPS) and lung adenocarcinoma. A chest-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan revealed multiple ground glass nodules in both lungs, with two larger nodules located in the upper lobe of the left lung.

The patient was subsequently treated with a combination of clonazepam, diazepam, and pregabalin. This regimen resulted in significant symptom relief within two weeks.

The patient then underwent surgical treatment for the lung adenocarcinoma. Postoperative pathology confirmed acinar invasive lung cancer, without involvement of adjacent lymph nodes or the visceral pleura. Immunohistochemical staining was positive for napsinA, CK-7, and TTF-1.

Following surgery, the patient regularly took prescribed medications and remained symptom-free until a follow-up visit six months later. At this visit, testing revealed the presence of anti-GAD65 antibody IgG (58 AU) in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid.
