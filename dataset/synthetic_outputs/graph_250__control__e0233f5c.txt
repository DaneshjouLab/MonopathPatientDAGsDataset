A retrospective analysis was conducted on nine patients with organizing pneumonia induced by radiation therapy. Eight patients had received radiation therapy for breast cancer, and one for lung cancer. Most patients (8/9) presented with symptoms, but none developed hypoxemia or respiratory failure, and their clinical course was generally favorable. Three patients received steroid therapy, but all three experienced recurrence. Conversely, none of the six patients treated symptomatically had a recurrence. One patient with lung cancer required mechanical ventilation.

The study included two detailed case reports.

**Case 1:** A 62-year-old female received postoperative radiotherapy (50 Gy) for right breast cancer. Fourteen months after completing radiotherapy, she developed fever and coughing. Antimicrobial therapy was ineffective, leading to hospital admission. On admission, her vital signs and breath sounds were normal. Chest CT revealed consolidation outside the radiation field in the upper, middle, and lower lobes. Bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) analysis showed no malignant findings, but lymphocytes were increased, and the CD4/8 ratio was decreased. A diagnosis of radiation therapy-induced organizing pneumonia was made. Due to severe respiratory discomfort on exertion, she was treated with methylprednisolone (500 mg for 3 days) followed by oral prednisolone (20 mg/day), which was tapered at an outpatient clinic. Eight months after initiating steroid treatment, chest radiography showed resolution of the shadows, and steroid administration was discontinued. However, one month later, new consolidation appeared in the left lung, indicating relapsing organizing pneumonia. Symptomatic treatment was initiated (as hypoxemia was absent), and the shadow completely disappeared within three months.

**Case 2:** A 64-year-old female with a history of pulmonary tuberculosis and chronic hepatitis C underwent thoracic radiation therapy (60 Gy) for lung adenocarcinoma of the right middle lobe. Six months after completing radiotherapy, she developed fever and a cough, and was hospitalized due to shadowing on chest computed tomography (CT). On admission, her vital signs were normal, and fine crackles were noted.
