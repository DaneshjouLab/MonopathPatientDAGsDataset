A 71-year-old man was diagnosed with ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and multiple liver and gastric metastases (cStage IVB). A biopsy of a liver metastasis confirmed ALK gene rearrangements via fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). The patient was started on alectinib 300 mg twice a day orally. After approximately six months of alectinib treatment, the original lung tumor shrunk, and multiple liver metastases disappeared.

Twenty-six months after alectinib initiation, the patient experienced seizures and consciousness disorders. A brain MRI revealed intracranial diffuse small metastases, left brainstem metastasis, and carcinomatous meningitis. The patient lost consciousness, had a Glasgow Coma Scale of 3, a performance status (PS) of 4, and dysphagia.

The patient was treated for status epilepticus for one week, but consciousness did not improve. A nasogastric tube was inserted, and lorlatinib 100 mg/day was administered via suspension. Seven days after lorlatinib initiation, the patient experienced a left brainstem hemorrhage due to brain metastasis.

Eight weeks after lorlatinib initiation, brain metastasis regression occurred. Brain MRI showed intracranial diffuse metastases and carcinomatous meningitis had disappeared (Fig.1Dâ€“F). After blood pressure management and rehabilitation, the patient was discharged home on foot. Lorlatinib was effective in this 73-year-old patient with ALK-positive NSCLC, showing carcinomatous meningitis, poor PS, and dysphagia upon failure of alectinib treatment. Central nervous system relapse occurred after alectinib treatment failure.
