A 68-year-old male was admitted to the hospital in June 2022 with correct upper lung occupancy on physical examination. Subsequent PET-CT findings revealed right upper lung cancer, multiple tiny nodules in both lungs (maximal diameter <4mm), and thyroid isthmus occupancy. CT-guided puncture of the right upper lung nodule led to a diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma (PD-L1 TPS=2%). Fine-needle aspiration of the thyroid gland resulted in a diagnosis of papillary carcinoma. Following treatments, a chest CT revealed stable disease. Post-surgery, a chest CT examination showed no signs of tumor recurrence. Thyroid color ultrasonography suggested isthmic thyroid nodules. Postoperative thyroid ultrasound showed no signs of tumor recurrence. PET-CT scans showed the primary tumor mass in the right neck subcutaneous at the time of diagnosis. Ultrasound results suggested a hypoechoic mass in the V region of the right neck. Puncture biopsies revealed: right lung adenocarcinoma (H&E staining, ×200), papillary thyroid carcinoma (Babbitt staining, ×200), and a spindle cell.
