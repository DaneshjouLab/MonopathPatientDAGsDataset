A 63-year-old female nonsmoker was diagnosed with stage IA adenocarcinoma after surgical resection. Five years after the surgery, the cancer recurred and was treated with various cytotoxic anticancer agents. During the course of treatment, the patient was found to be *BRAF* V600E mutation-positive and was treated with molecular-targeted drugs. Although multiple brain, subcutaneous, and tonsillar metastases appeared, the progression was significantly slower, and the patient survived for 14 years and three months after the initial diagnosis.
