A patient with a smoking history presented with a mass on chest computed tomography (CT). The mass, measuring 50 mm in diameter, was located in the right upper lobe. Right hilar lymph nodes were enlarged to 15 mm in diameter, raising suspicion for metastasis. Whole-body fluorine-18-flurodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and CT scan showed uptakes in the mass and the right hilar lymph nodes with standard uptake value max of 16 and 4.7, respectively. Sputum cytology and bronchoscopic examination confirmed squamous cell carcinoma. Further investigation revealed no distant metastasis, including brain metastasis on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The tumor was staged as cT2aN1M0.

The patient subsequently developed neurological symptoms, leading to a diagnosis of paraneoplastic neurological syndrome. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed longitudinally extended edematous lesions in the spinal cord. Cerebrospinal fluid examination was positive for anti-Aquaporin 4 (AQP4) antibody. These findings, in conjunction with the squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, led to a diagnosis of paraneoplastic neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD), specifically paraneoplastic neuromyelitis optica.

The patient underwent lung resection for the squamous cell carcinoma. Post-operatively, the patient experienced a recurrence of neurological symptoms and neuromyelitis optica, potentially triggered by surgical stress and epidural anesthesia. Treatment included steroid pulse therapy and plasma exchange. The patient's case highlights the association between malignant tumors, particularly squamous cell carcinoma, and neurological paraneoplastic syndromes, specifically anti-AQP4 antibody-positive neuromyelitis optica. Tumor detection and treatment, along with immunosuppressive therapies, are crucial in managing these complex cases.
