The human T cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is the first human retrovirus discovered. It is mainly associated with adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) and HTLV1-associated myelopathy (HAM). The relationship between HTLV-1 and other types of cancer is controversial. This case report describes a patient presenting with small cells lung epidermoid carcinoma who had recently developed HAM. This is the first case of this type of lung cancer associated with HAM outside Japan.

The infection by HTLV-1 may cause several lymphoproliferative disorders, such as adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL). In 1990, Matsuzaki et al. described for the first time in the literature the association of non-ATLL neoplasia and HTLV-1 infection, specifically a small cells type of lung cancer (SCLC) in Japan.
