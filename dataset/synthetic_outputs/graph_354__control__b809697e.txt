A patient presented with chest pain and dyspnea and was diagnosed with advanced metastatic lung adenocarcinoma. A lung tumor biopsy confirmed the diagnosis. The patient also developed pericardial effusion, which was found to be malignant, containing tumor cells. Further investigation revealed tumor metastasis and pleural effusion. Genetic testing identified an SQSTM1-ALK fusion and an MSH6 S346C mutation. The patient was treated with ALK inhibitors, specifically Ensartinib, targeting the SQSTM1-ALK fusion, which is characteristic of ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The patient achieved a partial response (PR) to Ensartinib treatment without any observable toxicity. This was evidenced by a decrease in CEA level, a reduction in carbohydrate antigen 125 level, a reduction in tumor size, and a reduction in pericardial effusion. Ultimately, the patient achieved complete remission (CR). The patient had previously experienced multiple metastases, including brain metastases, and had likely been treated with other ALK inhibitors, given the mention of ALK mutations.
