A 59-year-old male presented with a 6-month history of repeated cough and expectoration. His past medical history included gout for 15 years, with attacks occurring 2-3 times per year, managed with self-medication. He also had a 1-month history of dermatitis, treated with mometasone furoate cream. He denied any history of surgery or allergy to diclofenac sodium.

Chest CT revealed a soft tissue shadow in the right hilum (3.5 cm Ã— 1.3 cm), narrowed bronchi in the right upper lobe, thickened tube wall, and lesion enhancement. Enlarged mediastinal and right hilar lymph nodes with calcification were also noted. PET-CT showed a right upper hilar hypermetabolic mass (MT) and a mild metabolic lesion in the right upper lobe paramediastinal, suggesting possible right hilar lymph node metastasis.

Electronic bronchoscopy revealed yellow-white neoplasms blocking the lumen and invading the bronchial orifice of the right upper lobe. The surface mucosa in the bronchus of the posterior segment of the right upper lobe was congested and edematous.

Microscopic pathology indicated squamous cell carcinoma, staged as IIIA locally advanced driver gene mutation-negative NSCLC.

The patient was treated with neoadjuvant chemo-immunotherapy, consisting of three cycles of pembrolizumab.

Following neoadjuvant therapy, a single-port thoracoscopic right upper lung sleeve resection was successfully completed, with R0 resection achieved.
