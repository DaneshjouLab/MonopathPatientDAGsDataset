A 68-year-old woman with a one-month history of right-sided back pain and a 22 pack-year smoking history presented with tracheobronchitis and epiglottitis. During scrutiny for tracheobronchitis and epiglottitis, lung cancer was incidentally discovered. The patient had a history of Crohn's disease (CD) diagnosed nine years prior to presentation, with two recurrent episodes over the past several years. During the second recurrence of Crohn's Disease, colonoscopy showed discontinuous mucosal ulceration at the transverse colon, sigmoid colon, and rectum. Cobblestone appearance was observed at the sigmoid colon. Pathology of colonic specimen showed micro-abscess and cryptitis, supporting the diagnosis of Crohn's Disease. Gastrointestinal conditions were well-controlled for the previous 3 years with nutritional therapy, mesalazine (4000 mg/day), and adalimumab (80mg every 2 weeks). Physical examination showed a body temperature of 36.6 \u00b0C, no audible crackles on auscultation, absence of cutaneous eruptions, and negative neurological examinations. CT scan of the chest showed subpleural nodular consolidation (40 mm in diameter) invading the chest wall, two nodules (6mm and 8mm in diameter) in the right upper lobe, a cavitary nodule (21mm in diameter) in the left lower lobe, and reticulonodular shadows in the periphery of the bilateral lower lobes suggesting interstitial pneumonia. Oropharyngeal wall, epiglottis and aryepiglottic fold were swollen, with mild enhancement of contrast medium on contrast enhanced computed tomography of the neck. Bronchoscopy revealed swelling of the epiglottis with edematous change and mass-like epiglottis fold. The pyriform recess was not clear. There were nodular and edematous change in the trachea and bilateral main bronchus had an almost cobblestone appearance. Endobronchial biopsy showed infiltration by inflammatory cells (lymphocytes and plasma cells) without atypical or malignant cells. Evaluation for infectious causes of tracheitis and epiglottitis (bacterial, fungi and acid-fast bacilli of expectorated sputum as well as serologic evaluation for Aspergillus species, Cryptococcus species and latent tuberculosis) was negative. Histology of the epiglottic fold also showed infiltration by inflammatory cells. The patient was diagnosed with oropharyngitis, epiglottitis and tracheitis associated with Crohn's disease.
