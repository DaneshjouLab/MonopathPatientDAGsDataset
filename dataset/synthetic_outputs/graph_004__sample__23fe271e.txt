An 81-year-old female presented with a 10-day history of progressive chest tightness and dyspnea, worsened with physical activity, cough, and back pain. She had no history of smoking or malignancy. The patient underwent chest CT imaging, which revealed a large left-sided pleural effusion. Thoracentesis was performed, and the drained pleural fluid was sent to the Department of Pathology for further evaluation. A post-thoracic drainage chest CT revealed a 6.7 cm x 2.8 cm heterogeneous mass in the left inferior lobe with irregular contrast enhancement, suggestive of a left lung tumor. Pulmonary window analysis showed multiple nodular high-density foci scattered across both lungs, concerning for bilateral pulmonary metastases. Mediastinal window assessment revealed bilateral mediastinal lymphadenopathy and enlarged lymph nodes at the left pulmonary hilum, consistent with lymph node metastasis. An abdominal CT scan detected multiple low-density hepatic nodules of varying sizes, with the largest lesion (2.9 cm × 2.6 cm) located in the right hepatic lobe. Annular enhancement was noted in the arterial phase, while marked hypodensity was observed in the portal venous phase, demonstrating a “bull’s eye sign” characteristic of multiple hepatic metastases. An enhanced brain CT identified an irregular heterogeneously enhancing mass within the right frontal lobe, with a maximum cross-sectional area of 2.1 cm × 1.6 cm, consistent with brain metastasis. Cell block analysis of the pleural effusion demonstrated poorly cohesive round-to-oval cells with a dispersed distribution exhibiting eccentrically located nuclei with dense chromatin, abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, and nuclear morphology ranging from round to oval or slightly irregular shapes.
