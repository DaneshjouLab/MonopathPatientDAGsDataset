A 67-year-old Han Chinese male smoker presented with a nonproductive cough and increasing shortness of breath. Chest CT imaging showed central lung cancer located in the left lobe, accompanied by pulmonary artery invasion, obstructive atelectasis, and pleural effusion. Biopsied pathology from bronchoscopy indicated squamous cell carcinoma. Cytology from pleural effusion showed positive tumor cells. Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with metastatic lung cancer squamous cell carcinoma. The patient received 10 cycles of sintilimab, concurrent with chemotherapy containing gemcitabine and carboplatin in the first 4 cycles. Immunotherapy was replaced by paclitaxel for one cycle when CT evaluation suggested progressed disease. The patient tested negative for coronavirus via RT-PCR. The patient had close contact with his son who returned from Wuhan 15 days prior to presentation. Physical examination revealed rales of the lung and low breath sounds of the left thorax. Chest CT indicated peripherally subpleural lattice opacities at the inferior right lung lobe and bilateral thoracic infusion. Complete blood count showed increased white blood cell (WBC) and neutrophilic granulocyte counts with a concurrently decreased lymphocyte count.
