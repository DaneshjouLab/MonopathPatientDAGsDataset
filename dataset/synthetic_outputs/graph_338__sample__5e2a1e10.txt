A 33-year-old man presented with hemoptysis, preceded by a 4-year history of chronic cough and intermittent chest pain. He had a history of pulmonary tuberculosis diagnosed 7 years prior, which was successfully treated. Physical examination was unremarkable. The patient's chronic cough, intermittent chest pain, and hemoptysis prompted a CT scan.

The CT scan revealed a well-defined lobulated soft tissue density, with internal hypodensity indicating necrosis and coarse calcific specks involving the right hilar region extending up to the subcarinal location, measuring approximately 5.8 cm by 4.7 cm by 4.2 cm (craniocaudal × transverse × anteroposterior) dimension and involved the lung hilum at the level of the third thoracic vertebra. Compression of the right mainstem bronchus and bronchus intermedius and loss of fat planes with the right pulmonary artery causing splaying of its branches were also noted. CT scan findings led to bronchoscopy with biopsy and immunohistochemical examination.

Immunohistochemical examination of bronchioloalveolar lavage revealed positive cytokeratin AE1/AE3 and focally positive p63. Endobronchial biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma (ACC) of the right lung. Diagnosis of Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma (ACC) prompted planning for surgical intervention.

Surgical intervention was planned as the primary mode of treatment. Surgical intervention commenced with a right posterolateral thoracotomy. The tumor site was approached through a right posterolateral thoracotomy and the right pleural cavity was entered. Exploration revealed that the tumor was densely adherent to the left atrium, requiring dissection and division of several structures. On retrograde dissection, the following structures were sequentially divided: (1) inferior pulmonary vein, (2) the right mainstem bronchus, (3) the truncus anterior, and (4) the pulmonary artery. On entering the pericardium, the right and left atria and the pulmonary artery in that area were identified.
