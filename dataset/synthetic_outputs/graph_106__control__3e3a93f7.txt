A patient was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma harboring an EGFR exon 19 deletion. Initial treatment involved a right middle lobectomy for pathological stage IIB lung adenocarcinoma. The patient also presented with intrapulmonary metastases in the superior segment of the left lung. Despite the initial surgery, the patient's cancer progressed. Subsequent genetic testing revealed both the original EGFR exon 19 deletion and a BRAF V600E mutation. The patient was then treated with Osimertinib, followed by a combination therapy of dabrafenib and trametinib. The effectiveness of these treatments on the intrapulmonary metastases and overall outcome is not specified in this report.
