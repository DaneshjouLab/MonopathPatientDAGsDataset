In January 2018, a patient presented with coughing, shortness of breath, chest pain, back pain, and hemoptysis. A chest CT scan revealed a 7x4 cm irregular mass in the right middle lobe, local atelectasis, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and a 4x4 cm right lower hilar lymph node enlargement. Further SPECT imaging of a whole-body bone scan showed abnormal isotopic accumulation in multiple sites. A CT-guided lower lung biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. The final diagnosis was right lung adenocarcinoma with bone metastasis, staged as T4N2M1 stage IV.

In February 2018, the patient began treatment with 4 cycles of chemotherapy (GP regimen + recombinant human endostatin (Endostar)). Following this treatment, the patient experienced significant relief from coughing and shortness of breath. A follow-up chest CT scan showed a reduction in the right lung lesion to 3x3 cm, the size of the lower hilar lymph node decreased to 2.5x2.5 cm, and local atelectasis and pericardial effusion were alleviated.

However, in late June 2018, the patient developed coughing, shortness of breath, and lower back pain. A subsequent chest CT scan revealed elevated local atelectasis, a large amount of pericardial effusion, and bilateral pleural effusion. The patient was then given two cycles of chemotherapy (PP regimen + bevacizumab), but a thorough re-examination showed no improvements.
