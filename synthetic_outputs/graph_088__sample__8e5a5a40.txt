The patient was started on osimertinib 160 mg in combination with phenytoin. Thirty-two months after initiating osimertinib, a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with contrast showed overall stable visceral and osseous disease. The left pleural effusion had completely resolved, while the right pleural effusion remained stable in size. No new lesions or metastatic sites were detected. Subsequently, the patient developed nail changes with increasing brittleness (grade 1) and noted persistent and limiting dyspnea throughout the treatment course. Seizure activity was well controlled, and phenytoin levels remained stable. The dyspnea did improve after initial treatment for a pulmonary embolism but subsequently returned, with imaging demonstrating no recurrence of pulmonary emboli. Echocardiogram, exercise stress testing, and cardiopulmonary exercise test were normal. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) showed FEV1 of 1.92 L, FVC of 2.52 L, FEV1/FVC ratio of 0.76, normal spirometry, TLC, and a mild reduction in DLCO, suggesting COPD/emphysema. Oxygen saturation remained normal at rest and with exertion. The osimertinib dose was reduced to 80 mg daily for one week while continuing phenytoin, but dyspnea did not significantly improve. Osimertinib was then resumed at 160 mg daily. The patient achieved prolonged disease control on osimertinib treatment, with disease progression that later stabilized following three cycles of carboplatin/pemetrexed with continued osimertinib at a dose of 160 mg daily. No new lesions or metastatic sites were detected. She tolerated osimertinib well, developing nail changes with increasing brittleness.
