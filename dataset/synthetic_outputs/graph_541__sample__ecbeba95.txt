A 53-year-old woman, 169 cm tall and weighing 77 kg (BMI 26.96), with a history of a hot thyroid nodule, incipient osteoarthritis, breast cysts, neurodermatitis, left shoulder arthritis, hay fever, and various unspecified allergies, participated in the “Pre-PanTum” study between November 2020 and April 2021. She was medicated with 25 mcg Levothyroxine daily since July 1, 2019. Her history included smoking one cigarette per day for 7 years, but she quit 24 years prior. Her family history was notable for ovarian cancer in her mother at age 75 and colorectal cancer in her uncle at age 67.

During the study, a PanTum Detect blood test revealed an elevated combined PanTum score of 270 (Apo10 score: 144, TKTL1 score: 126). Tumor markers CEA, CA 19-9, CA 125, CA 15-3, AFP, beta HCG, and CRP were not elevated. Based on these findings, PET/CT imaging analysis was recommended.

FDG-PET/CT imaging revealed a 16 mm x 12 mm mass in the right upper lobe with increased focal 18F-FDG uptake (SUVmax 6.3) adjacent to the hilus. A follow-up PET/CT scan showed bilateral diffuse enhancement with mild focal emphasis cranially of the hilus (left SUVmax 5.8 > right SUVmax 4.8). Radiological findings revealed suspicion of lung carcinoma in the right upper lobe parahilar without pathologic lymph nodes. The 16 mm x 12 mm mass in the right upper lobe persisted.

A biopsy of the right upper lobe parahilar mass confirmed malignant lung carcinoma. The patient underwent surgical resection of the right upper lobe mass. Histologic examination revealed stage IA2 carcinoid without nodes or metastases (IA2 ED 01/21 pT1b (1.2 cm), pN0 (0/38), L0, V0, Pn0, R0 cM0). The tumor was completely removed, and no further therapy was required.

Three months post-surgery, the patient reported occasional paresthesia in the thoracotomy area. A thoracic CT showed post-operative changes, with no evidence of tumor recurrence. The patient was considered cured after surgical resection of the stage IA2 carcinoid without nodes or metastases (IA2 ED 01/21 pT1b (1.2 cm), pN0 (0/38), L0, V0, Pn0, R0 cM0). No chemotherapy was required.
