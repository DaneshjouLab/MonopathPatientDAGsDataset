A 73-year-old Japanese man presented with cough and dyspnea. The patient's cough and dyspnea led to further investigation. CT imaging revealed a tumor in the left lower lobe, with lymph node enlargement at the left hilum and metastasis to the sacrum and left adrenal gland. Imaging findings prompted a biopsy for diagnosis. A transbronchial lung biopsy with bronchoscopy was performed. Biopsy results led to a diagnosis of lung squamous cell carcinoma, cT4N2M1c stage IVB. Molecular testing was performed to guide treatment decisions. Oncomineâ„¢ Dx Target Test revealed no mutation of cancer-relevant genes. PD-L1 expression was 10%-24% in the 22C3 assay. The patient developed obstructive pneumonia and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG-PS) score of 2. Treatment was initiated for obstructive pneumonia and lung cancer. Antibacterial therapy for obstructive pneumonia was administered. Carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel were administered as first-line therapy. The patient's performance status improved, leading to the addition of pembrolizumab. The patient's ECOG-PS score improved, and pembrolizumab was added in the second treatment course. Five days after four cycles of treatment, the patient developed fever and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, raising suspicion for recurrent obstructive pneumonia. Oral antibacterial therapy was initiated. Further clinical course to be determined.
