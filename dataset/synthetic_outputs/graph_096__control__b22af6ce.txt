Here, we present a patient with locally advanced lung adenocarcinoma associated with *EML4*-*ALK* fusion mutation, who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and alectinib treatment, and then underwent thoracoscopic left lower lung lobectomy. The patient initially received eight chemotherapy cycles and achieved partial remission. After eight cycles of chemotherapy, the lymph nodes in the hilar region again enlarged. The patient was then switched to 4 months of alectinib therapy, but no significant lesion changes were detected on imaging during this period, raising the question of whether the patient developed alectinib resistance. The pathological findings of the postoperative lung lobe specimens indicated extensive necrosis in the tumor area with no residual tumor cells and massive chronic inflammatory cell infiltration around the tumor area, confirming inconsistency between the imaging findings and pathological results. The patient is currently being treated with adjuvant alectinib and no tumor recurrence or metastasis was found at follow-up until January 2023.
