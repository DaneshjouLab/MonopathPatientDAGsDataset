A 63-year-old man with a history of smoking 2 packs of cigarettes daily for 40 years presented with an abnormal shadow on a screening chest radiograph. Routine laboratory findings and serum levels of tumor markers were within normal limits. The patient underwent chest computed tomography, which revealed a 3.6-cm, well-defined, lobulated, solid mass in the right peripheral S5 segment. Subsequently, positron emission tomography showed 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose accumulation with a maximum standardized uptake value of 14.0. A transbronchial lung biopsy identified the mass as a non-small cell lung carcinoma, and the diagnosis was cT2aN0M0, stage IB.

The patient underwent a right middle lobectomy and systematic lymph node dissection. The resected tumor measured 4.0 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm with distinct margins. Microscopic examination showed the tumor consisted of large cells with large round nuclei, distinct nucleoli, and scant cytoplasm, with many rosette-like structures. Immunohistochemical analyses showed that the tumor was diffusely positive for CD56, and negative for chromogranin and synaptophysin. The final pathological diagnosis was large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC), and the pathological stage of the tumor was T2aN0M0, stage IB. Bronchial epithelium around the primary tumor was extensively invaded by the tumor cells.

Thirty months after surgery, the patient complained of a continuous cough. Computed tomography revealed a thickened right upper bronchus. Bronchoscopy showed that the epithelium of the right upper bronchus was reddish and thick, with prolongation of the longitudinal folds on auto-fluorescence imaging. Transbronchial biopsy yielded a pathological diagnosis of LCNEC with bronchial intraepithelial recurrence.
