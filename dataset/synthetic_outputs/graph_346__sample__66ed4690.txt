A 61-year-old female presented in May 2018 with painful left cervical lymphadenopathy for 2 months. The patient was treated with antibiotics at an outside hospital, which resulted in pain relief and a decrease in the size of the swollen lymph nodes. However, she subsequently experienced gradual right cervical node enlargement. Physical examination revealed several enlarged lymph nodes in the bilateral cervical and supraclavicular region. Ultrasound examination revealed several enlarged nodes, with the largest measuring 2.5 cm × 2.5 cm on the left and 2.5 cm × 2.0 cm on the right, exhibiting necrosis. A CT scan indicated an 8 mm micro-nodule in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe of the lung, suspected to be an inflammatory nodule. Multiple lymphadenopathies were initially suspected to be tuberculous. However, a PET-CT showed FDG accumulation in the lymph nodes of the neck, supracondylar, right iliac crest, sternal, mediastinum, and nasopharynx regions, but not in the lung, raising suspicion for lymphoma. Laboratory examination showed elevated CA125 (255.10 U/ml), CA153 (45.50 U/ml), and serum Fe (518.00 ng/ml).
