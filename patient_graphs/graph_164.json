        "content": "65-year-old male with small-cell lung carcinoma diagnosed 6 months prior, scheduled for pericardial-window-opening surgery (lateral thoracotomy approach). Emergency preoperative evaluation revealed severe chronic obstructive chest disease, bilateral malignant pleural effusion in the lungs and pericardial effusion, deemed too risky for general anesthesia. Heart rate 126 bpm, blood pressure 75/35 mmHg, SpO2 75%. Patient has no comorbidities, no history of surgery or allergy, but a smoking history of 100 pack years. Complete blood count, coagulation functions, and biochemical parameters were normal. Vital signs were monitored using three-lead electrocardiography and noninvasive blood pressure and SpO2 monitors. Peripheral venous access established, saline infusion started at 30 cm3/h. Oxygen delivered at 4 l/min via oxygen mask. Patient placed in semi-Fowler position. Ultrasound system used with a 6-18 MHz linear probe. Needle puncture point anesthetized with 2% lidocaine. A 21-ga, 10-cm stimulating needle introduced under ultrasound guidance. After negative aspiration, the plane between the latissimus dorsi and serratus anterior muscles filled with 15 cm3 of 0.5% bupivacaine plus 5 cm3 saline in 5 cm3 aliquots. 4 cm3 of 0.5% bupivacaine injected in the fifth and sixth intercostal region for additional analgesia. Adequate analgesia in the operation zone involving the dermatomes T3\u2013T6 confirmed. Surgery commenced. Surgery performed via semi-oblique incision in the fourth intercostal region. Intravenous administration of 2 mg midazolam and 30 mg propofol. No severe hypotension or arrhythmia. Patient reported no pain, even without local anesthetics. Ventilation supported manually as needed; spontaneous breathing maintained. Surgery lasted 45 minutes. Patient fully orientated and cooperative upon transfer to postanesthesia care unit for postoperative follow-up.",
