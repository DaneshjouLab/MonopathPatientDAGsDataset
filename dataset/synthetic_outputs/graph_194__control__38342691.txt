A male patient in his early seventies, with lung cancer combined with emphysema, developed a pneumothorax during treatment with anlotinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor. The patient was admitted to hospital mainly for dyspnoea and was diagnosed with pneumothorax after digital radiography of the chest. The patient's symptoms improved significantly after closed chest drainage, and a repeat chest digital radiography showed a more resolved pneumothorax. The patient had no previous history of pneumothorax. After discontinuation of anlotinib, the latest follow-up chest computed tomography assessment in August 2023 showed no recurrence of pneumothorax, thus, the pneumothorax is presumed to have been associated with anlotinib in this patient.
