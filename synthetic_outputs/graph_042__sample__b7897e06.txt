A 55-year-old male presented with a 3-week history of fevers, productive cough, dyspnea and wheeze. He had an 80-pack year smoking history and a positive family history of lung cancer. He was initially treated with oral amoxicillin and oral prednisone, but his symptoms deteriorated. Upon presentation to the emergency department, the patient's white cell count was 16.4 × 109/L (normal range: 4.0–10.0 × 109/L), neutrophil count was 13.8 × 109/L (normal range: 2.0–7.0 × 109/L), C-reactive protein was 118 mg/L (normal 0–5 mg/L), and serum sodium was 112 mmol/L (normal range: 136–145 mmol/L).

Chest X-ray showed right middle and lower lobe consolidation with associated moderate pleural effusion. The patient was admitted and treated for community-acquired pneumonia and work-up confirmed SIADH. Despite treatment with intravenous Piperacillin–Tazobactam and oral Clarithromycin, the patient's condition deteriorated with worsening consolidation on repeat chest X-ray. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit, intubated, and ventilated.

CT scan of thorax revealed a right hilar mass with mediastinal involvement and right-sided hilar adenopathy with superimposed extensive air space consolidation. Biopsy during bronchoscopy revealed histologically monotonous, small cells with dark ovoid nuclei, no nucleoli, and several mitotic figures. Immunohistochemistry showed CD45 negativity and AE1/AE3, TTF1 positivity. Focal minimal synaptophysin and chromogranin A positivity were also seen, leading to a diagnosis of small cell lung cancer. Full staging consisting of a CT-scan of the brain and Thorax–Abdomen–Pelvis confirmed extensive stage disease with adrenal metastases.
