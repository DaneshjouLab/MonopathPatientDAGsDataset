Percutaneous osteoplasty (POP) is emerging as a promising procedure for patients with painful bone metastasis who are unsuitable for surgery or who show resistance to radiotherapy and/or analgesic therapies. Bone metastasis is a common condition in patients with cancer, especially in patients with breast, lung, and prostate cancers. The most frequent symptom from bone metastasis is severe pain that can affect the quality of life of patients and usually limits patients’ mobility. Radiation therapy (RT) may be effective for pain relief and is a standard palliative treatment for metastatic bone tumors. Nonetheless, up to 20–30% of patients treated with RT do not respond to the treatment. Once the pain recurs at a previously irradiated site, RT cannot be performed again due to dose limits in normal tissues.

This report describes four patients with sternal metastases who suffered with severe pain of the anterior chest wall. The original tumors included lung cancer and thyroid cancer. The indication for POP in these four patients was that they were nonsurgical candidates due to poor performance status or patient refusal for surgery intervention. They experienced severe bone pain caused by sternal metastatic disease, which severely affected their quality of life, and their pain was unresponsive to conventional therapy, including various analgesics and chemotherapeutic regimens. Pain intensity was assessed using a 10-point numeric rating scale (NRS scores) with values from 0/10 (no pain) to 10/10 (maximum pain intensity).

For rapidly relieving severe bone pain caused by metastases and improving the life quality of those patients, POP was offered as a treatment to the patients with a multi-interdisciplinary consensus among a team of surgeons, oncologists, interventional radiologists, and radiotherapists. All four patients received POP procedure under fluoroscopic and cone-beam CT (CBCT) guidance, and obtained satisfying resolution of painful symptoms at 6-month postop follow-up. POP is a safe and effective treatment for pain caused by metastatic bone tumors in the sternum.
