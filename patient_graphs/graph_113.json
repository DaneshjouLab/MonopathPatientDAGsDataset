Salyl Lewis X\u2010i (SLX) level was 42.3\u2009ng/mL (normal range: 0\u201338.0\u2009ng/mL). PET-CT revealed fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in a 6-cm tumour shadow in the upper lobe of the left lung, metastatic tumours in the left lung and right adrenal gland, and a retroperitoneal tumour. Increased diffuse bone marrow FDG uptake was observed.",
