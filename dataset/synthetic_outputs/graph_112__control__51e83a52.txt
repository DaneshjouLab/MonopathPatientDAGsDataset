A 73-year-old male with lung cancer underwent bone scintigraphy for disease staging. Planar whole-body bone scintigraphy was performed in the anterior and posterior projections 3 hours after the injection of 740 MBq (20 mCi) of 99m technetium hydroxymethylene diphosphonate (<sup>99m</sup>Tc-HMDP). The bone scintigraphy images incidentally demonstrated diffuse myocardial tracer uptake. A diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis was suspected, although the patient had no symptoms at this time. Cardiac uptake on the planar image at 3 hours was evaluated using a semiquantitative visual scoring method in relation to bone (rib) uptake: grade 0 =no cardiac uptake and normal bone uptake; grade 1=cardiac uptake less than rib uptake; grade 2=cardiac uptake equal to rib uptake; and grade 3=cardiac uptake greater than rib uptake with mild/absent rib uptake. The cardiac uptake of this patient corresponded to grade 3 (uptake greater than rib uptake with mild rib uptake). Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) showed particularly strong uptake in the ventricular septum. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) showed widespread subendocardial and partly transmural enhancement of the left ventricular myocardium on delayed postcontrast T1-weighted images.
