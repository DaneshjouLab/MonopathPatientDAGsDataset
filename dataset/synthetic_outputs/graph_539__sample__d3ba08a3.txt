A 36-year-old man was admitted to the hospital in October 2016 with a cough and back pain for one month. A fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a mass of approximately 4 cm in the right upper lobe of the lung, accompanied by multiple mediastinal, hilar, bilateral supraclavicular, left retroclavicular lymph node metastases and bone metastasis. A Tru-Cut biopsy from the mass in the upper lobe of the right lung revealed SRC carcinoma with an inversion of the EML4-ALK gene detected by immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization. The patient was diagnosed with metastatic ALK-rearranged NSCLC.

In November 2016, crizotinib (250 mg twice daily) was initiated as the first-line treatment. Follow-up PET after 3 months showed the size and metabolic activity of the primary lesion and lymph nodes remarkably decreased. However, after 3 months of crizotinib treatment, the patient developed toxic hepatitis. Following this adverse reaction, the patient received lorlatinib after crizotinib and platinum-doublet chemotherapy. After 4 months of lorlatinib, the patient developed acute pancreatitis due to hypertriglyceridemia.
