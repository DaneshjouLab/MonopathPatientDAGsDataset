A patient was diagnosed with small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Initially, the extent of the disease was classified as limited-stage disease. The patient received curative radiotherapy and IC chemotherapy, including carboplatin and irinotecan. Later, the disease progressed to extensive-stage SCLC.

During the course of the illness, the patient developed gastrointestinal metastases, specifically small intestinal metastasis. These metastases led to complications including intestinal obstruction and, ultimately, intestinal perforation. The intestinal perforation resulted in diffuse peritonitis.

The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy, ileal resection, and anastomosis to address the intestinal perforation and peritonitis. Intestinal necrosis was noted during the surgical procedure. Post-operatively, the patient developed leukopenia and was treated with the antibiotic piperacillin/tazobactam.

Due to the extensive-stage SCLC, the patient was considered for further treatment options, including immunotherapy. However, the gastrointestinal metastases were deemed unresectable. The patient also received prophylactic brain radiation therapy. A CT scan was performed to assess the extent of the disease. The patient experienced further episodes of gastrointestinal perforation and intussusception.
