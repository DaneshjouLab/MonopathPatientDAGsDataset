A 60-year-old male patient with a history of previous drug use and cigarette smoking was evaluated for the first time at the HTLV clinic in October 2017. HTLV-1 infection was confirmed, but he was asymptomatic at that time. Subsequently, the patient was diagnosed with small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Thoracic spine MRI showed diffuse spinal atrophy with widening of the central canal, myelopathy, and a positive Babinski's sign on the right side.

In March 2018, the patient presented with weakness of the left lower limb and urinary incontinence. Neurologic examination revealed proximal muscle weakness (grade 4) in the lower limbs, spasticity, pyramidal signs, tetra hyperreflexia, and presence of the Babinski sign. HTLV-1 proviral load (PVL) was 47 copies/mL and the T-cell proliferation (LPA) test was 1,148 cpm.

Lumbar puncture revealed CSF with 20 cells/mm3 (85% lymphocytes, 15% monocytes), protein 47 mg/dL, glucose 37 mg/dL, lactic acid 17 mg/dL, and negative oncological cytology. Over the next four months, the patient developed dyspnea, dry cough, and weight loss. By July 2018, he experienced worsening lower limb weakness, urinary incontinence, was undernourished, and had a mild dry cough and dyspnea.

The patient presented to the emergency department. Chest X-ray showed opacity of the left hemithorax and a deviation of the trachea. Chest tomography showed an image suggestive of pulmonary neoplasia. Anatomopathological exams and immunohistochemistry of the pulmonary lesion confirmed the presence of small cell lung epidermoid carcinoma.

The patient rapidly progressed to death one month after hospital admission due to respiratory failure. Serum contained high levels of interleukin-2 receptors (IL2-R). SCLC cells were also positive for IL2-R.
