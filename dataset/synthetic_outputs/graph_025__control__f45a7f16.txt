A 68-year-old male patient was admitted to the hospital in June 2022 after a physical examination revealed a space-occupying lesion in the right upper lung. Positron emission tomography-CT (PET-CT) showed right upper lung cancer with multiple tiny nodules in both lungs, suspected to be metastatic foci. Aspiration biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the right lung. The right upper lung nodule was further diagnosed as lung adenocarcinoma (PD-L1 TPS=2%) by computed tomography (CT)-guided puncture.

During the same period, thyroid nodules were detected by ultrasound and puncture, and papillary thyroid cancer was confirmed by pathology. Abnormal ultrasound of lymph nodes in the V region of the neck, with puncture suggesting a spindle cell soft tissue tumor, prompted a multidisciplinary team to evaluate the case.

After chemotherapy and targeted therapy, multidisciplinary evaluation ruled out the possibility of lung metastasis. Puncture pathology of the supraclavicular mass favored the diagnosis of myxoinflammatory fibroblastic sarcoma (MIFS). Ultimately, the patient underwent radical surgery, including resection of the upper lobe of the right lung, systematic lymph node dissection, and enlarged resection of the neck mass.

This case highlights the potential for misdiagnosis of supraclavicular masses in patients with lung cancer, emphasizing the importance of considering non-metastatic lesions and the crucial role of multidisciplinary collaboration and precise pathological diagnosis in differentiating complex tumors. The patient presented with combined lung and thyroid cancer, further complicating the diagnostic and treatment approach.
