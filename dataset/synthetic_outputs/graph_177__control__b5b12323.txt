A 65-year-old man underwent surgery for primary lung cancer in the right middle lobe. Preoperative computed tomography showed a 10-mm pleural soft tissue density nodule with osteal protrusion anterior to the tubercle of the right sixth rib, and this lesion was concomitantly resected. Intraoperative findings showed that this pleural lesion originated from the parietal pleura and was pathologically diagnosed as a benign fibrous tissue. Differential diagnoses of pleural nodules include pleural dissemination of malignant disease, malignant pleural mesothelioma, malignant lymphoma, fibrous tumor, pleural plaque related to asbestos, thoracic splenosis, and thoracic endometriosis.
