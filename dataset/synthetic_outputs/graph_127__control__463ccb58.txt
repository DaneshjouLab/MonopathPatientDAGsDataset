A 21-year-old woman with a history of pericarditis and cardiac tamponade was referred from a clinic due to nausea, vomiting, ascites, lower extremity edema, soft and watery diarrhea, and right upper quadrant pain. She presented with pericardial constriction, which was initially misdiagnosed. After relevant investigations, surgery (sternotomy and partial pericardiectomy) was proposed. Intraoperatively, it was discovered that the constriction was due to a malignancy. The patient died shortly after the operation. Pathology confirmed the diagnosis of primary malignant pericardial mesothelioma (PMPM).
