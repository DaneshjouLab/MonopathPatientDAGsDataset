A 64-year-old man with a history of adenocarcinoma of the right lung with metastasis to vertebral and mediastinal lymph nodes, and coronary artery disease, presented with back pain. Thoracic MRI revealed a T7 pathological compression fracture with lytic bone lesions secondary to metastatic disease. During his admission, he developed new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which resolved spontaneously without intervention. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) did not reveal intra-cardiac thrombi. He was discharged on aspirin and β-blockers due to a low CHADS-VASC score.

The following day, the patient returned to the hospital confused. Brain MRI revealed an acute lacunar ischemic infarction in the right centrum semiovale. On admission, he was again in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Chest x-ray revealed a stable right infrahilar mass with adjacent subsegmental atelectasis. A repeat TTE was negative for any intra-cardiac thrombus or masses.

He was diagnosed with an acute ischemic stroke, minor, with no hemorrhagic conversion, and placed on IV heparin. Brain and neck magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) revealed mild atherosclerotic disease. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) showed a small echo density at the orifice of the right upper pulmonary vein, suspicious for a thrombus, with a low flow velocity across the pulmonary vein (26.6 cm/s, normal 30–80 cm/s) and no other left atrial or left ventricular thrombus formation. Chest x-ray showed a right-sided infrahilar mass with adjacent subsegmental atelectasis. 2D transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) revealed thrombus in the right upper pulmonary vein. Multiple prior thoracic CT scans to evaluate lung cancer and thoracic spine for back pain did not reveal any pulmonary vein thrombosis (PVT). A decision was made not to repeat a thorax CT scan to confirm the findings of PVT as the patient was already on anticoagulation.
