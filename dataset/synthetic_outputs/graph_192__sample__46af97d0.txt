A 77-year-old Japanese woman with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ECOG performance status 1, presented with a history of resection of the right middle lung lobe for lung adenocarcinoma (clinical T1aN0M0, clinical stage IA) two years prior. Pulmonary metastasis was noted during follow-up one year after resection.

The patient underwent five cycles of pemetrexed therapy for the pulmonary metastasis of NSCLC. Progressive disease was noted, and she was switched to nivolumab as second-line therapy (2 mg/kg, every 2 weeks).

One day after the second infusion of nivolumab, the patient presented with progressive myalgia, ophthalmoplegia, and blepharoptosis. She denied chest pain and dyspnea.

The patient was taking codeine phosphate for a cough. Her Glasgow Coma Score was 15. Body mass index was 16.4 kg/m2, with no noticeable body weight changes. She had a slight fever of 37.1Â°C.

Vitals were: Blood pressure 120/76 mmHg, pulse 76/min, respiratory rate 18/min, oxygen saturation 96%. Physical examination revealed bilateral blepharoptosis (left-side dominant) and limitation of ocular movement. Eyes could slightly move to the left, up, and down, but not to the right. Visual acuity was 0.9 (right) and 0.8 (left).

Manual muscle test was 4/5 at the neck, bilateral arms, hip, and proximal muscles. No murmurs or crackles were observed. Chest radiography showed a tumor mass in the left lower lung field, and the cardiothoracic ratio was 51% without pleural effusion. Chest computed tomography demonstrated tumor masses (14 mm at the left S1+2 and 16 mm at the left S9), with no thymoma or interstitial pneumonia noted.

ECG showed a bifascicular block (first-degree atrioventricular block and complete right bundle branch block) and ST-segment elevation in leads I, II, III, aVF, V3, V4, V5, and V6 without reciprocal ST-segment depression.

Transthoracic echocardiography showed a preserved ejection fraction without asynergy, and no pericardial effusion or obvious myocardial edema was noted.

ECG on day 3 showed trifascicular block (first-degree atrioventricular block, complete right bundle branch block, and left anterior hemiblock). ECG on day 5 showed progression to atrioventricular dissociation. ECG on day 14 showed the recovering trifascicular block, which transformed into a bifascicular block on day 26. Laboratory data showed elevated aspartate aminotransferase (757 U/L), alanine aminotransferase (225 U/L), lactate dehydrogenase (1,634 U/L), C-reactive protein (1.21 mg/dL), brain natriuretic peptide (88.1 pg/mL), creatine kinase (CK) (11,297 U/L), CK-MB (204 U/L), and troponin T (1,478 ng/L).
