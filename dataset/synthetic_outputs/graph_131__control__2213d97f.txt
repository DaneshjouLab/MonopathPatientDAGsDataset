A 71-year-old female with no significant past medical history presented four and a half years ago with a weight loss of about 50 pounds over six months prior to presentation. She complained of occasional shortness of breath but denied any cough. Physical examination revealed enlarged right axillary and supraclavicular lymph nodes. Mammography revealed multiple enlarged right axillary lymph nodes, but no suspicious lesions were seen in either breast. An ultrasound-guided core biopsy of the right axillary lymph node was performed, and the histopathology report showed poorly differentiated metastatic adenocarcinoma. A computed tomogram (CT) of the chest with contrast enhancement revealed multiple irregular nodular opacities in bilateral lungs, with the largest measuring 10 mm, and extensive bilateral mediastinal lymphadenopathy and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, with the largest measuring 1.8 cm (Figures 1-3). A positron emission tomography (PET) scan revealed hypermetabolic nodules in the lung and multiple suspicious nodes in the neck, chest, and abdomen, suggesting advanced stage IV lung cancer.

She responded well to the treatment with a decrease in the size of pulmonary tumor nodules (from 11.12 to 7.97 mm) noted on the follow-up CT scan (Figures 4-5). She went on to complete eight cycles of maintenance pemetrexed, and on follow-up, a CT scan revealed the right upper lobe lung nodule to have increased in size from the previous 1 x 0.7 cm to 1.5 x 0.8 cm (Figure 6). Six months following commencement of nivolumab, complete resolution of lung lesions was seen on CT chest (Figures 7-9). The lung lesions remain unremarkable since then (Figure 10). After being on treatment for almost four years, the patient developed a pruritic, hyperpigmented rash on the upper and lower extremities and trunk. The rash was associated with dermographism and minimal erythema, suggesting grade II-III maculopapular rash, a well-known side effect often seen in patients being treated with checkpoint inhibitors. The patient presented to ER and was subsequently admitted for significant posterior epistaxis and melena along with a drop in her hemoglobin.
