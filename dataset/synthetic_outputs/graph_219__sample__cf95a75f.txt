A 66-year-old female, never smoker, was admitted in October 2022 with shortness of breath and a productive cough without fever or chills. Her ECOG performance status was 1. Physical examination revealed a saturation of 88% on ambient air and dullness in the lower lung fields on left chest percussion. A contrast-enhanced chest CT revealed a 35 x 30 mm mass in the left upper lung with enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, as well as massive pleural fluid on the left side. Thoracocentesis was performed, and cytology revealed malignant cells, indicating tumor progression involving the pleura. PET-CT showed increased 18F-FDG uptake of the left upper lung mass with a SUVmax of 15.49. The PET-CT scan also indicated intensive 18F-FDG hypermetabolism in the left pleura nodules (SUVmax = 12.03) and left mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes (SUVmax = 9.66). Lung mass biopsy confirmed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with positive staining for CK7 (3+), TTF-1 (3+) and Ki67 (70 %). Tumor cells were negative for programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1). Next-generation sequencing (NGS) showed the presence of KIF5B-RET rearrangement in both lung biopsy tissue and pleural effusion samples. A concurrent genetic aberrance was a missense mutation in TP53. The NGS testing also revealed a tumor mutation burden (TMB) of 1.25 Muts/Mb. The patient was diagnosed with stage IV (T2aN2M1a) lung adenocarcinoma with a RET rearrangement. The patient started on Pralsetinib treatment with the recommended dosage of 400 mg once daily.

After 2 months of Pralsetinib treatment, the patient experienced decreased exercise tolerance and grade 2 leukopenia. Chest CT imaging revealed a reduction in tumor volume to 17 x 12 mm, and her pleural effusion disappeared. Metastatic pleural nodules were comparable to the initial findings, achieving a partial response (PR) according to RECIST 1.1 criteria.

Pralsetinib dosage was gradually reduced to 200 mg once daily due to treatment-related adverse events since December 2022. After 7 months of targeted therapy, metastatic nodules in the pleura were not visible in chest CT.

An August 2023 PET-CT examination showed a significant reduction in SUVmax value of the primary tumor (SUVmax = 1.37). 18F-FDG uptake was not detected in the left pleura and N2 lymph nodes.

In September 2023, the patient underwent surgical resection of the left upper apical and posterior (LS1+2) segments, together with dissection of pleural nodules and lymph nodes. Severe adhesions were observed intraoperatively.

Downstaging of locally metastatic disease was achieved after 10 months of Pralsetinib treatment. Follow-up PET-CT after 10 months of Pralsetinib treatment showed a slight increase in 18F-FDG uptake of the primary tumor (SUVmax = 1.37). Follow up imaging showed no 18F-FDG metabolic activity in the pleura and lymph node. Chest CT examination showed metastatic pleural disease. Patient underwent surgical resection and histological analysis showed a pathologic complete response (pCR) of the tumor.
