A patient with stage IV small cell lung cancer (SCLC), who had received three prior lines of therapy (atezolizumab, carboplatin, and etoposide; topotecan; and epirubicin, cyclophosphamide, and vincristine) over the course of one year, experienced progressive disease. Due to extensive somatostatin receptor (SSTR) positivity in all tumor manifestations, including the primary tumor with pleural metastases, multiple involved mediastinal lymph nodes, upper abdominal involvement, and disseminated bone and brain metastases, the patient was deemed eligible for SSTR-directed radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT). After two cycles of RPT, the patient exhibited a partial response, with a significant reduction in the primary tumor, pleural metastases, and lymph node metastases, and minimal residual metabolic activity in the bone metastases. No relevant toxicity was observed, and the patient's quality of life significantly improved. However, after four cycles, [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET/CT displayed an overall stable total tumor burden. Further investigation revealed SSTR downregulation in some lesions, suggesting a potential evasion mechanism to SSTR-directed RPT.
