Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), infection (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]) outbreak started in Wuhan, Hubei Province, Peopleâ€™s Republic of China, and spread globally. Initially, patients presented with fever with or without respiratory symptoms. Various degrees of pulmonary abnormalities developed later in all patients, visible on chest computed tomography (CT) imaging. Most patients experienced a mild illness, but approximately 15% to 20% required assisted oxygenation. The severe group had a high mortality rate and was associated with older age, underlying diseases such as diabetes, and medical procedures.

Two patients who recently underwent lung lobectomies for adenocarcinoma were retrospectively found to have had COVID-19 at the time of the operation. Pathologic examinations revealed that apart from the tumors, the lungs of both patients exhibited edema, proteinaceous exudate, focal reactive hyperplasia of pneumocytes with patchy inflammatory cellular infiltration, and multinucleated giant cells. Hyaline membranes were not prominent. Because both patients did not exhibit symptoms of pneumonia at the time of operation, these changes likely represent an early phase of the lung pathology of COVID-19 pneumonia.
