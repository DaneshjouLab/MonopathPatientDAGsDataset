A 64-year-old man, diagnosed with advanced stage IVA lung squamous cell carcinoma, presented with dyspnea and recurrent, massive hemoptysis. The patient had a history of lifelong smoking and underlying conditions of bronchiectasis, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. He experienced recurrent and massive hemoptysis lasting six days (once or twice daily), with approximately 200 ml of bright red blood per episode.

Physical examination revealed decreased breath sounds on the left side. The patient was hypoxic, requiring nasal cannula oxygenation at 3 L/min (oxygen saturation was 99%), and exhibited elevated leucocyte (22.2 × 10^9/L), neutrophil counts (19.6 × 10^9/L), and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (16.20 mg/L). A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed a giant tumor (45 mm minor axis diameter) in the left lung hilus and occlusion of the left superior pulmonary vein, and the left superior pulmonary artery in the tumor. Destroyed lung associated with bronchiectasis was located at the upper lobe of left lung.

An intervention was performed, but it did not mitigate the hemoptysis. Fortunately, a different strategy proved successful, with the patient’s hemoptysis resolving completely over a six-month follow-up period, and no pulmonary infarction was detected on the CT reexamination.
