A patient was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma harboring KRAS mutations. Initially, the patient received Osimertinib treatment. However, the lung adenocarcinoma cancer developed resistance to Osimertinib. Further investigation revealed the presence of a KRAS exon 2 mutation and exon 3 mutations. Due to the resistance to Osimertinib, the patient was subsequently treated with paclitaxel and carboplatin. Following this, the patient developed a KRAS exon 3 mutation and was then treated with paclitaxel and nivolumab.
