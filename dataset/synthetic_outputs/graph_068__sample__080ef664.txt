In September 2021, a patient presented to The First Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University with chief complaints of chest pain and fatigue for half a year. The patient was admitted for evaluation of a "lung shadow." A chest MSCT revealed a partial solid nodule in the posterior segment of the upper lobe of the right lung, measuring 21 mm * 13 mm, with lobulation, burrs, pleural indentation, and a vacuole. Multiple small lung nodules were also observed in both lungs. Blood tests revealed neutrophilia and lymphocytopenia.

Subsequently, the patient underwent surgical resection of lung tissue. Post-operative pathology confirmed invasive adenocarcinoma in the upper lobe of the right lung, measuring 1.3 * 1.2 * 1 cm, involving the pleura, with no neurovascular invasion. No metastasis was found in the parbronchial lymph nodes.

In November 2022, ground glass nodules were detected in the upper lobe of the left lung, measuring approximately 18 mm * 9 mm, indicating recurrence of the primary cancer. The patient reported symptoms of fatigue, a pale tongue, white fur, and a weak pulse. The patient refused a second surgical treatment.

By January 2024, a CT examination revealed recurrent tumor shrinkage, measuring approximately 7 mm * 9 mm. Blood routine, liver, and kidney function tests were normal. The lung masses changed in size from 2021 to 2024, indicating that the lung tumors became significantly smaller during treatment after lung CT examination. The carcino-embryonic antigen level tended to be normal. Dense shadows and cord foci were seen in the hilar area of the lung before TCM treatment.
