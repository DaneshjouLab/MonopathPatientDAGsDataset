A 66-year-old female with a past medical history of thyroid Hurthle cell neoplasm, menorrhagia, and uterine leiomyomata status post-hysterectomy 10 years prior without histological evidence of malignancy presented in August with a 10-month duration of progressive dyspnea, nonproductive cough, and thoracic pain with deep inspiration. She denied any tobacco use history or recent sick contacts and had normal preventative cancer screenings regarding mammography and colonoscopy. Respiratory examination demonstrated absent breath sounds over the left lower lung fields.

Initial lab workup revealed a Hemoglobin of 14.9 g/dL and platelets of 314 \u00d7 103/\u03bcL. A complete metabolic panel was unremarkable. N-terminal pro-b-type natriuretic peptide was 64 pg/mL. C-reactive protein was 3.3 mg/L. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was mildly elevated at 30 mm/hour.

Due to persistent respiratory symptoms, a CT scan of the chest was performed, showing a heterogeneous mass-like consolidation in the left upper lobe with left upper and lower lobe bronchi occlusion.

Based on the imaging findings, the patient was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation of the mass-like consolidation.

The patient underwent bronchoscopy, which demonstrated a completely obstructing pearly, white endobronchial lesion within the distal portion of the left mainstem bronchus requiring cryoprobe debulking.

Histological examination from biopsy and eventual resection was notable for residual lipoblasts, with positive fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) testing for MDM2 gene amplification and positive MDM2 immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining.

Further pathological analysis revealed that the tumor stained for desmin but was negative for epithelial markers (cytokeratins). Final pathology demonstrated spindle cell sarcoma corresponding to a dedifferentiated liposarcoma with leiomyosarcomatous differentiation.
