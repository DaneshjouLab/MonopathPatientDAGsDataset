A 36-year-old woman was diagnosed with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma harboring the EGFR L858R mutation. She received first-line treatment with osimertinib for 24 months, after which she experienced progressive disease. A rebiopsy revealed that the lung lesion was still adenocarcinoma. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) revealed the presence of BRAF V600E and TP53 mutations in addition to the original EGFR L858R mutation. The patient was subsequently treated with aumolertinib in combination with dabrafenib and trametinib, achieving a complete response for 8 months.
