Our patient is a woman who developed a subacute amnestic syndrome, followed by cognitive impairment, headache, temporal lobe epilepsy and hyponatraemia. She recounted testing positive for COVID-19 20 days before, with mild respiratory symptoms, fatigue and tiredness. One week later, her fatigue increased, accompanied by vivid and unfamiliar dreams, and the emergence of short-term memory loss. She reported the onset of episodes resembling paroxysmal panic attacks 2 weeks before the consultation, occurring three times per week. Additionally, she started having insomnia 2 weeks before her emergency room visit. Her medical history included occasional asthma, severe pneumonia in her 20s, an appendectomy in 2020, and polycystic ovaries for which she received treatment with desogestrel, resulting in amenorrhoea. An early-stage asymptomatic breast cancer was identified on positron emission tomography (PET) scan. We report the first well-documented case of anti-LGI1 limbic encephalitis in a woman with newly diagnosed breast cancer. Autoimmune encephalitis is a severe neurological disorder associated with antibodies against neuronal cell-surface or intracellular onconeural proteins. Partial retrograde and anterograde amnesia persisted during the initial weeks, followed by slow and steady improvement.
