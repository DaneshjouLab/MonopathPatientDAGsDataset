A 79-year-old male with small cell lung cancer stage 4 with multiple intra-abdominal metastasis received two cycles of chemotherapy (atezolizumab, etoposide, and carboplatin) administered over a 10-week period. Carboplatin dose was approximately 200 mg/m2 per cycle, totaling 710 mg over two cycles. One week after the second cycle of chemotherapy, the patient complained of gradually worsening bilateral vision impairment. The patient has a history of hypertension and cataract surgery in the left eye six months prior. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was hand motion in both eyes. Intraocular pressures were measured at 19 mmHg in the right eye and 18 mmHg in the left eye. No relative afferent pupillary defect was noted. Fundus examination showed optic nerve pallor in the left eye and bilateral retinal arterial narrowing with sclerosis. No retinal hemorrhage, cotton wool spot, or neovascularization observed. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) revealed generalized choroidal and retinal thinning in both eyes and mild cystoid macular edema in the right eye. 30-Flicker electroretinogram testing revealed a completely absent cone response in both eyes. Fluorescein angiography demonstrated significant delayed filling of the choroidal and arterial circulation and abnormal delayed drainage of venous circulation in the inferior arcade. No evidence of obstructive lesions of arteries or veins. Blood routine test, coagulation function, and orbital magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) did not reveal any abnormalities. A diagnosis of ischemic optic neuropathy secondary to carboplatin administration was made. Chemotherapy was planned to be temporarily discontinued pending oncological consultation. Visual acuity aggravated to no light perception even after the cessation of chemotherapy. Fundus photographs and optical coherence tomography (OCT) images showed retinal artery narrowing and sclerosis in both eyes, with more severe manifestations in the peripapillary area. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) revealed generalized choroidal and retinal thinning in both eyes.
