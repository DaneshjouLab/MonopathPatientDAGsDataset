A 71-year-old man presented with bloody sputum and left chest pain. He had a significant smoking history of 20 cigarettes per day for 59 years. Chest radiography revealed a mass at the apex of the left lung. A transbronchial lung biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

The patient subsequently underwent a left upper segmentectomy and lymph node dissection. Macroscopic examination of the resected mass revealed it was 6.0 cm in its greatest dimension, with a white-to-tan color on the cut surface. Microscopic examination showed the solid tumor was composed of polygonal cells with round vesicular nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and slightly eosinophilic or amphophilic abundant cytoplasm.

Histopathology of the resected tumor showed scattered multinucleated cells, multifocal necrosis, and hemorrhage. No squamous or glandular features were observed. No lymph node metastasis was detected. PD-L1 tumor proportion score was 60%. Resection revealed a 6.0 cm left upper lobe tumor with pleural invasion, classified as pT4 N0. Further investigation revealed a left hilar mass 8.5 cm in diameter involving major bronchi, ipsilateral pleural effusion, and a 1.9 cm diameter mass in the left upper lobe.

Further staging revealed a 3.1 cm diameter tumor in the right upper lobe, lymph node metastasis, and brain metastasis. Immunohistochemistry of tumor cells showed coexpression of p40 (BC28; Roche Diagnostics) in approximately 80% of tumor cells and TTF-1 (8G7G3/1; Dako) in 10% of cases. Immunohistochemistry also showed positive staining for anti-TTF-1 (SPT24; Novocastra) in 40% of cases. Most TTF-1-positive samples were also positive for p40, indicating coexpression of p40 and TTF-1. The TTF-1 staining intensity of SPT24 was stronger than that of 8G7G3/1. PD-L1 (22C3 pharmDx KIT) tumor proportion score was 60%.
