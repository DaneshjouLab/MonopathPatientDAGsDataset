The patient presented with intermittent chills, shivering, and fever, with the highest temperature of 39˚C, accompanied by shoulder and back pain, dizziness, and headaches. In early September 2023, after a cold, the patient developed these symptoms. The headaches were continuous, without projectile vomiting, dyspnea, or chest tightness. On October 3, 2023, a chest-enhanced computed tomography (CT) at the local hospital revealed multiple enhanced nodulars in the bilateral hilum and mediastinum, with the largest one measuring approximately 5.6 cm × 6.1 cm, indicating a mediastinal mass. On October 10, 2023, an outpatient head-enhanced CT revealed scattered multiple ring-enhanced nodules measuring approximately 1.0 cm × 0.9 cm in both cerebral hemispheres and the left cerebrum, accompanied by extensive surrounding edema. These findings suggested intracranial infectious lesions, potentially indicating tuberculosis. After hospitalization with impaired consciousness and delayed reactions, laboratory findings were as follows: Leucocyte count (6.4 × 109/L), Neutrophil percentage (78.2%), Procalcitonin level (0.1 ng/mL), Alanine transaminase level (136.1 IU/L), Aspartate aminotransferase level (143.2 IU/L), Carbohydrate antigen 125 level (253.7U/ml).
