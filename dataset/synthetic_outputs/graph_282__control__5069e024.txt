A patient with advanced adenocarcinoma of the right lung (stage IVA) was treated with immunochemotherapy for 6 months. The patient subsequently manifested acute respiratory failure. A chest CT scan revealed diffuse ground-glass opacity predominantly in the left lung. Immunotherapy-induced interstitial pneumonitis was initially suspected due to the stability of the primary lesion and a decrease in the serum carcinoembryonic antigen level. However, bronchoalveolar lavage from the left lung revealed adenocarcinoma cells, confirming the diagnosis of pulmonary lymphangitis carcinomatosa. This case highlights the potential for misdiagnosis, as pulmonary lymphangitis carcinomatosa can mimic immunotherapy-related interstitial pneumonitis.
