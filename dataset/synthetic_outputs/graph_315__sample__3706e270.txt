The patient presented with symptoms suggestive of cystitis. Urine culture and urine cytology were negative. Cystoscopy showed diffuse mucosal redness and bleeding. The patient was started on methylprednisolone 60 mg/day (1 mg/kg). Symptoms and cystoscopic inflammatory findings improved immediately. Methylprednisolone was reduced to 20 mg/day and the patient was discharged home while continuing methylprednisolone 20 mg/day. One month after discharge, the patient experienced a recurrence of glans penile pain, micturition pain, and pyuria. Cystoscopy revealed inflammatory findings in the bladder mucosa. Urine culture was negative again. One month after discharge, the dose of methylprednisolone was gradually increased, but symptoms markedly enhanced. The dose of methylprednisolone was increased to 60 mg/day, 3 weeks after the recurrence of symptoms. After increasing the dose of methylprednisolone to 60 mg/day, the symptoms and pyuria improved. It was difficult to reduce the dose of methylprednisolone below 40 mg/day. Infliximab (5 mg/kg) administered in conjunction with methylprednisolone. Symptoms of steroid-resistant cystitis were relieved early by concomitant use of infliximab.
