A patient with small cell lung cancer (SCLC IIIb) developed severe rhabdomyolysis after the first cycle of etoposide-nedaplatin chemotherapy. The patient experienced progressive general muscle pain and weakness. Laboratory tests revealed elevated creatine kinase (CK), myoglobin (Mb), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Examination and medical history review excluded other potential causes of rhabdomyolysis, such as trauma, strenuous activities, infections, drugs, hyperthermia, and immunity. The patient was diagnosed with severe rhabdomyolysis induced by chemotherapy. Treatment with intravenous fluids and methylprednisolone led to symptom relief and significant improvement in laboratory results. Unexpectedly, a follow-up lung CT scan showed a significant reduction in the lung mass compared to pre-chemotherapy imaging. Rhabdomyolysis syndrome refers to the breakdown and necrosis of muscle tissue due to various reasons and caused by the release of intracellular contents into the blood stream, which can lead to acute renal failure or even death.
