A 74-year-old man with a 30-year history of hypertension, managed with compound reserpine, nifedipine extended-release tablets, and captopril, resulting in controlled systolic blood pressure at 150 mmHg, and a 7-year history of carotid stenosis on the left side and cerebral stenosis, was found to have a ground-glass nodule discovered in the upper lobe of the right lung. Thoracoscopic wedge resection of the right upper and lower lung nodule was performed under general anesthesia. Postoperative pathology revealed invasive adenocarcinoma in the upper lobe of the right lung, with two masses that did not invade the lung membranes, and no cancerous involvement of the anastomotic margins. The lower lobe of the right lung showed microinvasive adenocarcinoma without invasion of the lung membranes, and no cancer involvement at the anastomotic end margins.

Four years later, the patient, with a history of right lung cancer surgery, was found to have a nodule in the right lung that had increased in size over the past 3 days compared with the previous one. Complete blood examination revealed no significant abnormalities. A CT-guided percutaneous lung nodule aspiration biopsy was performed on July 28, 2023. Thermal ablation of the lung nodule was performed under local anesthesia on August 8, 2023. Regular follow-up chest CT scans of the upper and middle lobe lesions in the right lung were conducted, alongside thermal ablation treatment to reduce the lesions compared to those of the previous scan.

On January 9, 2024, the patient was admitted to the emergency department for acute upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage after having 3 black stools for 5 hours, large in total amount, without vomiting blood, accompanied by obvious panic and weakness, without fainting, and without abdominal pain and distension. He presented with black stool and was found to have a hemoglobin level of 58 g/L.
