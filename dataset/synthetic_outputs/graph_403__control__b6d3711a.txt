A 71-year-old male presented with a large hydrocele, which was noted during a routine prostate gland consultation. Testicular ultrasound revealed a right hydrocele with echogenic material, indicative of chronicity, and a 3 cm heterogeneous testicular tumor located on the antero-inferior wall, hyper-vascularized in Doppler. The contralateral testis was normal. The patient was subsequently diagnosed with a malignant mixed germ cell tumor (MTVT). He underwent radical inguinal orchidectomy. Two years later, the patient relapsed with mediastinal and retroperitoneal lymph-node metastasis, eventually presenting with multiple metastatic lung nodules.
