Benign multicystic peritoneal mesothelioma, first described in 1979, presents as large multicystic masses with thin-walled septations, preferentially located in the pelvic peritoneum. Typical symptoms include abdominal pain, distention, and tenderness, often associated with nausea and vomiting, and sometimes ascites. This condition predominantly affects women (80% of cases), typically young to middle-aged women with a mean age of 37. At the time of diagnosis, the cysts have usually already grown considerably.
