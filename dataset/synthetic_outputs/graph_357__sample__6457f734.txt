A 64-year-old man was admitted in October 2021 with exertional dyspnea and hypoxia. He was diagnosed with Adenocarcinoma subtype Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) with metastases to the lungs, liver, and brain. An AKIF5B-RET fusion was confirmed by RNA-based multitarget next-generation sequencing panel. Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression was 35%.

The patient had a medical history of transient ischemic attack and a 5 pack-year smoking history. Prior treatment included three cycles of carboplatin, pemetrexed, and pembrolizumab, which resulted in a partial response, followed by 12 months of second-line pralsetinib, also with a partial response. Three small-volume brain metastases (largest lesion 7 mm, left parietal lobe) had been present at baseline and previously responded to pralsetinib without requiring radiation therapy. He had experienced three prior episodes of low-grade (maximum grade 2) pralsetinib-related pneumonitis between November 2020 and April 2021, which were managed with oral steroids, treatment interruption, and dose reduction (400 mg once daily to 200 mg once daily).

During the October 2021 admission, the patient developed grade 3 drug-related pneumonitis. A CT Pulmonary Angiogram (CTPA) revealed multiple lung metastases and multifocal ground-glass changes consistent with pneumonitis, with no evidence of infection or pulmonary embolus. His neutrophil count, white blood cell count, and C-reactive protein level were within the reference range; he had no pyrexia or sputum production. Treatment was initiated with high-flow oxygen and 1 mg/kg oral prednisolone. Pralsetinib was suspended. Baseline axial and coronal CT imaging revealed multifocal ground-glass opacification in keeping with pralsetinib-related pneumonitis.
