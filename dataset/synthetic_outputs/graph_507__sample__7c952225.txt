A 70-year-old Japanese man experienced occasional pain in the right side of the chest and dyspnea. He was diagnosed with malignant pleural mesothelioma. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed diffuse irregular right pleural thickening (Fig.1). The patient underwent right extra-pleural pneumonectomy after three courses of induction chemotherapy. During the surgery, the right main bronchus was cut using a scalpel. The mucosal surface of the bronchial stump was ablated with electrocautery (Monopolar Cut, blend, at 30 W x 30 W, for 1-2 seconds). The bronchial stump was then sutured manually using 3-0 absorbable monofilament sutures using a single ligation suturing technique with Sweet’s method. Post-operative chest computed tomography (CT) scans showed diffuse thickened pleura in the right chest cavity. No bronchial fistula developed post-operatively. Four years after surgery, the patient died of recurrent malignant pleural mesothelioma and underwent autopsy. Autopsy macroscopic evaluation showed tight adhesions and white scars on the main bronchial stump and the intervals between the sutured stitches (Fig.3a). Autopsy microscopic findings showed fewer inflammatory cells around the lesion of mucosal tight adhesion, except for the innermost layer part of the sutured bronchial mucosa (Fig.3b, c). Fewer α-
