A 38-year-old male, a heavy smoker, presented with a 3-day history of colicky right-sided and epigastric abdominal pain. The pain increased with eating, was not relieved by H2 blockers, but was partially relieved by Ibuprofen. He also reported abdominal distension, sweating, nausea, and vomiting of clear fluid without blood. Accompanying these symptoms were generalized fatigue, a feverish sensation, anorexia, and recent weight loss. The patient also developed dyspnea and a cough without hemoptysis. Physical examination revealed diffuse tenderness and guarding of the abdomen, more prominent in the right upper and lower quadrants, along with rebound tenderness.

An initial chest X-ray showed retrocardiac consolidation of the right lower lobe of the lung, enlargement of the cardiac outline with a water bottle sign suggesting pericardial effusion, and obliteration of the right costophrenic angle denoting moderate right-sided pleural effusion.

These chest X-ray findings prompted further investigation with a chest and abdominal CT scan with intravenous contrast, which revealed ascites, a right lower lobe lesion suggesting consolidation, and associated pleural and pericardial effusion.

The CT scan findings of pericardial effusion led to echocardiography, which detected a large pericardial effusion with significant right ventricular compression and normal left ventricular size and function.

Detection of ascites on the CT scan prompted abdominocentesis. The fluid obtained was yellow and turbid, with increased lactate dehydrogenase, normal glucose, total protein, and albumin.

The abdominocentesis results and pleural effusion findings led to pleural fluid analysis and pericardiocentesis. Pleural fluid analysis showed: Glucose 105 mg/dL, LDH 112 U/L (increased), Total protein 2.7 g/dL, Albumin 1.8 g/dL, indicating an exudative fluid. Pericardiocentesis showed a bloody, turbid aspirate. Cultures of the pleural, pericardial, and peritoneal fluid samples showed no evidence of bacterial or fungal growth. Peritoneal fluid analysis showed: Glucose 108 mg/dL, LDH 121 U/L (increased), Total protein 3.7 g/dL, Albumin 2.4 g/dL. Pericardial fluid analysis showed: Glucose 37 mg/dL (decreased), LDH 1156 U/L (increased), Total protein 5.2 g/dL (increased), Albumin 3.3 g/dL. Serum values were: Glucose 106 mg/dL, LDH 168 U/L (decreased), Total protein 6.1 g/dL, Albumin 3.9 g/dL.

Pleural and pericardial fluid analysis prompted further analysis including cytology and a pericardial window. Cytology of the peritoneal fluid showed macrophages, neutrophils, and occasional lymphocytes with reactive mesothelial cells and was negative for malignancy. Cytology of the right pleural fluid revealed few reactive mesothelial cells, many lymphocytes, few neutrophils, and the absence of cancer cells. A pericardial window under echocardiography-guidance illustrated mild chronic inflammation with no evidence of malignancy.

Based on initial findings, the patient was started on colchicine, ibuprofen, metronidazole, and levofloxacin.

Following treatment, a follow-up CT scan revealed resolution of almost all of the pleural effusion, with significant reduction of pericardial effusion but persistence of a spiculated soft tissue enhancing lesion measuring about 2.1 cm in the right lower lobe associated with hilar and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. A chest CT scan showed a spiculated mass in the right lower lobe of the lung. A neck CT scan showed an enlarged left supraclavicular lymph node. A whole-body positron emission tomography scan demonstrated a hypermetabolic potentially malignant right pulmonary nodule in the posterior basal segment of the lower lobe, bilateral prominent-sized.
