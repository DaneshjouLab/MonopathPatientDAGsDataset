A 76-year-old male with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the lung developed obstructive shock and a transient ischemic attack (TIA) due to intracardiac metastasis. The patient presented with hemodynamic instability and a fall. A TIA with right facial droop and left pronator drift developed, which resolved within six hours. Given his poor performance status (ECOG 3), he was started on palliative radiation therapy and discharged to hospice care. Intracardiac metastasis, a rare complication of lung cancer, led to severe hemodynamic issues and neurological events like stroke. In this case, the tumor thrombus caused obstructive shock and increased the risk of ischemic stroke. Cancer-associated stroke is more common in patients with thoracic malignancies, underscoring the need for a multidisciplinary approach to manage these complex cases.
