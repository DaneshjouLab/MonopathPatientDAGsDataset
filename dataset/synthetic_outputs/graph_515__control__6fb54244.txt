Based on the provided data, it's impossible to construct a complete clinical case report with patient demographics, a timeline of diagnoses, treatments, and outcomes. The data only contains mentions of genes and proteins, specifically:

*   EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor)
*   HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2)
*   MET
*   ROS1 (ROS proto-oncogene 1)
*   HER
*   ALK

A clinical case report would require significantly more information, such as:

*   **Patient Demographics:** Age, sex, medical history, etc.
*   **Presenting Symptoms:** What brought the patient to seek medical attention?
*   **Diagnostic Tests:** What tests were performed (biopsies, imaging, etc.) and what were the results?
*   **Diagnosis:** What specific condition was the patient diagnosed with?
*   **Treatment Plan:** What treatments were administered (surgery, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, etc.) and when?
*   **Outcomes:** How did the patient respond to treatment? What were the side effects? What is the current status of the patient's condition?

Without this information, it is impossible to create a clinical case report.
