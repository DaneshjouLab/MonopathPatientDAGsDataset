A 74-year-old male presented with fever and dyspnea. Initial chest x-ray revealed a right-sided pleural effusion. Further investigation with CT scans revealed right pleural thickening, lung volume loss, and pleural effusion. A video-assisted thoracoscopic pleural biopsy indicated the diagnosis of MPM (cT1N0M0 Stage I). Following diagnosis, first-line therapy with nivolumab (240 mg every 2 weeks) plus ipilimumab (1 mg/kg every 6 weeks) was initiated. The patient developed diarrhea at the later period of the second treatment cycle, requiring second cycle interruption; CTCAE irAE colitis (Grade 2); symptoms gradually improved without steroid administration, enabling him to resume the third cycle. Diarrhea relapsed during the fourth cycle and was considered irAE colitis (Grade 3); ICI therapy was discontinued, and oral prednisolone (PSL) of 0.5 mg/kg was initiated. Low-dose PSL was continued for over a month, which improved diarrhea symptoms. The patient insisted on resuming ICI chemotherapy; thus, the fifth treatment cycle was resumed.
