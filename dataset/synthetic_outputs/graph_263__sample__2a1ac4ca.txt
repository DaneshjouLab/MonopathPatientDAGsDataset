In September 2018, a 67-year-old woman with a history of hypertension diagnosed a dozen years prior presented with chest pain. A chest CT showed a lesion in the right upper lung with mediastinal lymph node enlargement. Based on these findings, she was diagnosed with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) showed EGFR exon 19 L747-P753 deletion and TP53 exon 8 mutation. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) showed no alterations in ALK, BRAF, and MET genes. Consequently, first-line gefitinib (250 mg/day) therapy was initiated and continued for 6 months.

In April 2019, a follow-up assessment after treatment with gefitinib revealed that the patient had developed progressive dyspnea, and chest ultrasonography showed massive right-side pleural effusion. Due to these developments, gefitinib was discontinued.

In May 2019, the patient began treatment with osimertinib (80 mg/day) as second-line therapy. She also received indwelling pleural catheter treatment for malignant pleural effusion. Tumor cells were detected in the pleural effusion cell block. PD-L1 22C3 tumor proportion score was 80%. EGFR Exon19 deletions were detected in the pleural effusion cell block based on EGFR amplification refractory mutation systemâ€“polymerase chain reaction (ARMS-PCR) and plasma ctDNA NGS analysis. Ultimately, osimertinib was discontinued due to poorly controlled malignant pleural effusion.
