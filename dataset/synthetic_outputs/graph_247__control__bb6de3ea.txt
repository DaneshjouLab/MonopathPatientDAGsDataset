A patient presented with bilateral giant bullous emphysema (GBE) and rapidly progressive dyspnea. The dyspnea was initially attributed to tension bullae caused by a check valve mechanism in the context of COVID-19 bronchitis. Multiple nodules were detected. The giant bullous emphysema was successfully treated with percutaneous drainage followed by resection. Intraoperative biopsy revealed the presence of lung cancer.
