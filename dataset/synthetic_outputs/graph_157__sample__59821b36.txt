The patient's case begins on July 15, 2019, with the initiation of Crizotinib capsules at a dosage of 250 mg twice daily. Four weeks later, the patient experienced a sharp increase in transaminase levels, specifically aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, with alanine aminotransferase reaching 1,225 U/L. Consequently, Crizotinib capsules were immediately discontinued. On September 9, 2019, Crizotinib was restarted at a reduced dosage of 250 mg once daily.

On November 18, 2019, imaging revealed multiple metastases in the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, and right ventricle. Follow-up imaging on January 3, 2020, showed the patient's left hilum and left upper lobe tumor was slightly smaller (size: 56 mm × 40 mm) than on November 16, 2019. Carcinomatous lymphangitis of the upper lobe of the left lung remained unchanged, and multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum showed no significant changes.

Further imaging on January 5, 2020, demonstrated that the multiple intracranial metastases were significantly smaller and had disappeared compared to previous imaging. However, by July 3, 2020, the patient's left hilar tumor with obstructive atelectasis had significantly enlarged (size: 87 mm × 139 mm) compared to May 20, 2020.

On August 27, 2020, imaging revealed an enlarged tumor, multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum (some larger than before), nodular thickening of the left pleura (more advanced than before), and bilateral pleural effusion. The patient also had a left hilum and left upper lobe mass.
