An 80-year-old male presented with sudden painless testicular swelling. Initial conservative management failed, leading to a radical orchidectomy. Pathological examination revealed malignant mesothelioma of the testes, a rare and aggressive urogenital malignancy. The patient subsequently developed retroperitoneal recurrence. Aggressive surgical intervention, including resection of the retroperitoneal recurrence, was performed. The case documents positive patient outcomes following the use of aggressive surgical intervention in the management of a metastatic testicular mesothelioma. Malignant mesothelioma of the testes is associated with poor prognosis, especially in the event of metastatic spread.
