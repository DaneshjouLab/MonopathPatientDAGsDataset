Abstract: This case report describes a patient presenting with pericardial tamponade, found to have small-cell lung carcinoma and malignant pleural effusion, leading to pericardial effusion. The patient underwent pericardial-window-opening surgery.

Introduction: Pericardial tamponade can arise from various etiologies, including trauma, malignancy, end-stage renal disease, iatrogenic causes, and idiopathic origins. This case highlights a presentation secondary to malignancy.

Case Report: A patient presented with pericardial tamponade. Further investigation revealed the patient had small-cell lung carcinoma and malignant pleural effusion, resulting in pericardial effusion. The patient also had a history of chronic obstructive chest disease. The patient experienced hypotension and arrhythmia. The patient underwent pericardial-window-opening surgery.

Discussion: The differential diagnosis and management of pericardial tamponade are discussed, including considerations for ascites, morbid obesity, breast cancer surgery, thoracotomy, rib fractures, corrosive stricture, chest pain, motor vehicle accident, diabetes mellitus, high blood pressure, obstructive sleep apnea, pneumothorax, hemothorax, and rib fracture pain.
