A 40-year-old woman was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma with brain metastases. A novel CLHC1/RNT4 intergenic region, ALK fusion, was identified. The patient benefited from crizotinib and endostar sequential alectinib. The patient's condition was controlled and the curative effect was evaluated as stable disease (SD). Brain lesions were significantly reduced, and partial remission (PR) was achieved.
