A 53-year-old female was initially diagnosed with Invasive adenocarcinoma, TNM classification T4N1M1b, Stage IVA. The tumor measured 1.8 cm x 2.2 cm and was located in the lower lobe of the left lung. CT scanning also revealed ground glass nodules in the upper left lung.

On May 12, 2020, the patient underwent single-hole thoracoscopic radical resection in the left upper lobe of the lung. During surgery, a 2.0 cm x 1.5 cm mass was identified in the posterior apex of the left superior lung, along with multiple micro-nodules in the right lung.

Following surgery, the patient's diagnosis was revised to invasive stage IA adenocarcinoma (T1N0M0). She was treated with left upper lobectomy and systematic lymph node dissection.

An NGS panel revealed an EGFR p.E746_S752delinsI mutation with 29.62% VAF in a tissue sample. The E746_S752delinsI mutation in EGFR Exon 19 was identified by NGS.

Based on the EGFR mutation, the patient started Icotinib (125mg/day) on November 18, 2020.

From December 8, 2020, to July 27, 2021, the patient experienced Grade II stomach pain.
