A 56-year-old male with occupational exposure to asbestos as a tunnel inspector presented to the emergency room with cough, low back pain, and abdominal pain. A CT angiogram of the chest showed a large left pleural effusion tracking to the lung apex with near complete opacification of the left lower lobe, a 6-cm left lower lobe mass, and a 4-cm left hilar mass with mediastinal adenopathy and pleural nodularity. The patient underwent left video-assisted thorascopic surgery with total left lung decortication, removal of fibrin deposits, and placement of a pleural drainage catheter requiring daily drainage. Pathology from the left pleural mass revealed a malignant epithelial neoplasm with 70% spindle cell and 30% epithelioid cell components, consistent with biphasic malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). PET imaging confirmed advanced disease with extensive left-sided pleural involvement, bilateral mediastinal adenopathy, adrenal, and scattered bone lesions. CT images at baseline demonstrated large pleural and mediastinal disease with no spinal involvement. The patient began receiving immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy with nivolumab and ipilimumab, with initial improvement in pleural drainage output. After one cycle of therapy, the patient presented with lower back pain, lower extremity numbness, and inability to walk.
