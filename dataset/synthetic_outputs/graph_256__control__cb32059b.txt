A 61-year-old asymptomatic male smoker presented for low-dose lung CT lung cancer screening at the referral of his primary care physician. The initial study identified a suspicious 1.6 cm spiculated apical right upper lobe nodule and a small right lower lobe consolidation felt to represent infection and inflammation. A Lung-RADS category 4X was assigned due to the high-risk apical nodule. PET/CT and pulmonary consultation were recommended in the original report.

PET/CT was notable for increased FDG uptake in the basilar consolidation. Transthoracic needle biopsy of both lesions was performed. Pathologic diagnoses revealed a pulmonary amyloid nodule for the apical nodule and pulmonary extramarginal zone lymphoma of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT lymphoma) for the basilar consolidation.

Low-dose CT is a widely accepted method of screening for lung cancer in high-risk patients. While incidental findings commonly occur in this setting, the large number of patients screened also increases the probability of rare diagnoses and rare combinations of diagnoses. In this case, a combination of a rare benign diagnosis (pulmonary amyloid nodule) and an uncommon incidental malignant diagnosis (pulmonary MALT lymphoma) were made in the same patient. This case underscores the value of pathologic diagnosis in cases of indeterminate lung nodules.
