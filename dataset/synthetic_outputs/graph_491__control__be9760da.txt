A 63-year-old woman with no notable medical history and no smoking or family history was referred to the department due to a right lung tumor with progressive enlargement. No significant symptoms were observed. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a well-circumscribed right middle lobe tumor measuring 3.1cm in maximum diameter without calcification or suggestion of pleural invasion. The tumor was located in the proximal part of the right middle lobe. Compared with a previous CT image, the tumor had enlarged over 10 years. Blood serum levels of tumor markers were within the normal range. F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography-CT (PET-CT) showed an accumulation of F-18 FDG in the tumor (maximum standardized uptake value, 3.17). Head contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging showed no lesions. Although the shape of the tumor appeared to be benign, its tendency to grow and the presence of F-18 FDG accumulation could not rule out lung cancer. Therefore, a differential diagnosis of primary lung cancer stage IB (cT2aN0M0) was made. Preoperative biopsies were not performed due to the location of the tumor.

The preoperative differential diagnosis was cStageIB lung cancer. A right middle lobectomy was performed, and a histopathology examination revealed meningioma. There were no primary lesions in the head and whole spine magnetic resonance imaging, thus, a final diagnosis of Primary Pulmonary Meningioma (PPM) was made. Cautious observation is required postoperatively due to the possibility of recurrence.
