A 66-year-old male patient presented in November 2017 with a thin-walled cavity surrounded by a ground-glass opacity (GGO) in the right lung on CT. Enhanced CT scan showed the degree of enhancement of the lesion was difficult to evaluate, and the structure inside the cavity was irregular. The patient had a 40 pack-year history of cigarette smoking and a history of contact with tuberculosis patients, including his mother and sister. Vital signs were stable, and no obvious abnormalities were found on examination. Related tumor markers were negative.

The patient had undergone video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy in August 2007 for primary lung adenocarcinoma in the right upper lobe. Pathology demonstrated a well differentiated adenocarcinoma of stage T2bN0M0 (stage 2A). Chest CT in 2007 showed a 4.3 cm Ã— 2.5 cm mass in the right upper lobe and a small thin-walled cavity in the right anterior basal segment. A chest CT in 2008 showed no change in the 43-mm solid lesion in the right upper lung and a small thin-walled cavity in the lower lobe.

Between 2008 and 2014, chest CT showed gradual enlargement of a cavity from 11 mm to 14 mm in diameter with no recurrence. By August 2017, chest CT showed the lesion had increased to 31 mm and had become a bulla surrounded by GGO.

On November 15, 2017, the patient underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic wedge resection of the right lower lobe. Final postoperative pathology diagnosis was lepidic predominant adenocarcinoma. The surgical specimen showed a cavity with a malignant appearance in the surrounding tissue. Pathology showed lepidic predominant adenocarcinoma. No lymph node metastasis was observed. The patient recovered well and was discharged one week after surgery. During the follow-up period of 24 months, no recurrence was noted.
