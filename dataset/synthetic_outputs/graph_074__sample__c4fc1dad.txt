A patient presented with an abdominal ultrasound showing a fluid collection with septations adjacent to the spleen. A subsequent CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a complex cystic lesion in the left upper quadrant, measuring 7.6 x 11.7 cm, which was reported as a lymphangioma. The patient was asymptomatic at this time, and physical exam was unremarkable. No therapeutic intervention was initiated, and a follow-up CT scan was scheduled in six months. The follow-up CT scan confirmed the left-sided subdiaphragmatic cystic lesion measuring 7.6 cm in transverse dimension below the diaphragm between the liver and the spleen.

At a later date, the patient reported feeling pressure and a pulling sensation on the left side of her abdomen, rated as 4/10 for pain. A repeat CT scan showed the cystic lesion had almost doubled in size, now measuring 11 x 22 cm, with extension into the hepatorenal space. Ultrasound-guided aspiration was performed, revealing 33 mL of clear yellow fluid. Pathology analysis showed no evidence of malignant cells. An MRI demonstrated a large T2 hyperintense cystic mass extending from the spleen on the left to the left hemipelvis, along with enhancing septations. The patient then received doxycycline sclerotherapy over eight months, followed by a post-sclerotherapy ultrasound.
