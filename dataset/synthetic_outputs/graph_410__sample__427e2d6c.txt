In May 2013, a 68-year-old man presented with an abnormal chest radiograph result. Further examinations revealed right upper lobe adenocarcinoma. In June 2013, he underwent a right upper lobectomy. The final diagnosis was stage IIA (p-T1bN1M0) lung adenocarcinoma with an activating EGFR L858R mutation, detected through the PNA-LNA PCR clamp method. Adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin and pemetrexed was started but discontinued after one course due to anorexia and hyponatremia. In August 2018, an enlarged mediastinal lymph node was observed on imaging. Adenocarcinoma recurrence was confirmed via biopsy, revealing the EGFR L858R mutation and PD-L1 TPS negativity (<1%). In December 2018, first-line chemotherapy with osimertinib and ramucirumab was initiated. In February 2019, ramucirumab was discontinued due to adverse events of bleeding and oral mucositis; osimertinib alone was continued. A partial response was achieved with osimertinib alone, and no adverse events, including pneumonitis, were experienced. Following osimertinib treatment, a subpleural lesion appeared. Rebiopsy revealed squamous cell carcinoma. The size of the subpleural lesion reduced, but the mediastinal lymph nodes progressed. A subsequent rebiopsy revealed adenocarcinoma.
