A 63-year-old male presented to the emergency department with a 2-week history of worsening shortness of breath in the upright position. The patient experienced dyspnea (platypnea) and arterial desaturation (orthodeoxia) in the upright position, which improved in the recumbent position, characteristic of Platypnea-orthodeoxia syndrome (POS). The patient presented with position-dependent dyspnea and hypoxemia.

The patient had no relevant medical history. Physical examination showed absent breathing sounds on the left hemithorax. There were no signs of orthostatic hypotension. Oxygen saturation was 68% in the upright position and 93% in the supine position with 5 L of oxygen supplementation through nasal cannula. Arterial blood gas in the supine position showed hypoxemia (pH 7.44; pO2 8.1 kPa; pCO2 4.3 kPa; bicarbonate 22 mmol/L).

Chest x-ray showed complete atelectasis of the left lung. Bronchoscopy revealed a complete obstruction caused by adenosquamous bronchial carcinoma in the left main bronchus. Lung perfusion scintigraphy in the recumbent position showed clues for absent hypoxic vasoconstriction, because the left lung still showed a perfusion contribution of 30%. Transthoracic echocardiography with agitated saline showed a small patent foramen ovale (PFO) with only subtle right-to-left shunting in the upright position.

Platypnea-orthodeoxia syndrome (POS) resolved completely after left-sided pneumonectomy. The patient was then treated with adjuvant chemotherapy.

Echocardiography 6 months after pneumonectomy showed subtle right-to-left shunting through the PFO. The patient reported gentle shortness of breath with exertion. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) was performed in the upright position with arterial blood sampling due to persistent subtle right-to-left shunting through the PFO and gentle shortness of breath with exertion. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) showed no signs of hypoxemia at rest (pO2 12.2kPa) nor with maximum exercise (pO2 13.7kPa). Maximum VO2 was reached 1842ml/min and 120% of predicted.

1.5 years after the pneumonectomy, multiple suspected lymph nodes and right femur metastasis were found. The right femur metastasis was treated with radiotherapy.
