A 44-year-old nulliparous woman was initially diagnosed with a uterine leiomyoma. During surgery for the leiomyoma, she was incidentally found to have malignant peritoneal mesothelioma (MPM). Diagnostic laparoscopy and subsequent imaging revealed extensive peritoneal involvement, confirmed by histopathology and immunohistochemistry, ultimately leading to a final diagnosis of epithelioid peritoneal mesothelioma. The patient's desire to preserve fertility complicated the treatment approach. She underwent chemotherapy followed by immunotherapy, achieving complete disease control. Without evidence of disease recurrence or metastasis, the patient proceeded with in vitro fertilization (IVF) and embryo transfer. During an emergency cesarean section at 30 weeks 2 days of gestation, performed due to preterm premature rupture of membranes, intraabdominal residual tumors were discovered and excised. No evidence of malignancy was found elsewhere.
