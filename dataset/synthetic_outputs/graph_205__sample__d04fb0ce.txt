A 62-year-old man, diagnosed with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) in 2010, confirmed by milky-opaque bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and the presence of an anti-GM-CSF antibody, presented in July 2018 with dyspnea on exertion and an elevated serum Krebs von den Lungen 6. Carcinoembryonic antigen remained unchanged at 15 ng/mL. Computed tomography revealed a new 30 mm nodule in the lower lobe of the right lung and extended ground-glass opacification. Left lung lavage under general anesthesia was conducted. Respiratory symptoms improved after lavage. Imaging showed that the shadows indicative of PAP had partially disappeared. Transbronchial lung biopsy on the nodule diagnosed invasive adenocarcinoma. Metastasis to the pleura, multiple bones, and right adrenal gland was noted consistent with a clinical stage T2aN0M1c, stage IVB. Programmed cell death 1 ligand tumor proportion score was 0%. No driver mutations, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), anaplastic lymphoma kinase, and c-ros oncogene 1 genes were noted. First-line chemotherapy with cisplatin, pemetrexed, and bevacizumab was selected in August 2018, to which the patient had a partial positive response.
