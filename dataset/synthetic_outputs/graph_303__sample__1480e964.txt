In September 2016, a 57-year-old man was diagnosed with squamous cell thymic carcinoma (TC) with a diameter of 3.6 cm, involving the sternal manubrium and bone metastases in the sternum and ribs. The stage was IVa according to the Masaoka-Koga system.

From October 2016 to February 2017, the patient received six courses of first-line chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel, administered every three weeks. After three cycles of chemotherapy, the patient achieved a partial response (PR) according to RECIST 1.1, which was confirmed at the end of the sixth cycle. Sequential radiotherapy was performed on the mediastinal mass, with a dosage of 60 Gy in 30 fractions.

Four months after the end of the first-line treatment (approximately June 2017), an 18FDG-PET/CT scan showed areas of increased uptake in the 6th and 7th right ribs and progressive disease in the sternal body according to MD Anderson criteria.

From July to December 2017, the patient underwent second-line therapy with gemcitabine. An 18FDG-PET/CT scan revealed progression of the primary mediastinal mass, new lesions in the posterior arch of the 6th right rib and pulmonary hilar lymph node involvement. A CT scan confirmed these findings.

In January 2018, the patient underwent a 68-Gallium (68Ga)-DOTATOC-PET/CT scan, which showed slight somatostatin receptor uptake by both the primary and metastatic lesions.

In February 2018, the patient started third-line chemotherapy with a modified ADOC (mADOC) scheme consisting of doxorubicin 40 mg/m2, vincristine 0.60 mg/m2, and cyclophosphamide 700 mg/m2, without cisplatin. After the third cycle of mADOC, the patient achieved a partial response (PR).
