A 76-year-old man with a 57 pack-year smoking history presented for investigation of a mass on chest CT. Chest CT showed a 50 mm mass in the right upper lobe and right hilar lymph nodes enlarged to 15 mm. Whole-body fluorine-18-flurodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and CT scan showed uptakes in the mass and the right hilar lymph nodes with standard uptake value max of 16 and 4.7, respectively. No distant metastasis was observed. Brain metastasis was not indicated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Sputum cytology showed squamous cell carcinoma. Clinical stage cT2aN1M0 (cStage IIb). Hemoglobin A1c 8.0%. Tumor markers: squamous cell carcinoma-related antigen 3.6 ng/mL, cytokeratin-19 fragment 2.4 ng/mL. Glasgow Coma Scale E4V5M6, no neurodegeneration, motor/sensory deficits, or peripheral neuropathy. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery was performed. Pathological examination of resected specimens showed squamous cell carcinoma with a pathological stage of T2aN0M0 (pStage \u2160B). Administration of levobupivacaine and fentanyl via epidural catheter started immediately before surgery and confirmed until postoperative day (POD) 2.
