Here, we present a case of a 65-year-old male with hemoptysis caused by a pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysm (PAP) after chemotherapy combined with tislelizumab for lung SCC. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of PAP formation after chemotherapy combined with tislelizumab for lung SCC. This report describes a case of massive hemoptysis caused by a pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysm (PAP) after chemotherapy combined with tislelizumab for lung SCC, providing a reference for clinical practitioners.

A 65-year-old male was admitted to our hospital with sudden massive hemoptysis. The patient denied experiencing chest pain, dyspnea, or fever. He had a 20-year history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but no other significant comorbidities such as vascular diseases, and was not receiving any other chronic therapies at the time of presentation. Two months prior, an enhanced CT scan suggested a tumor in the right upper lung, and a biopsy confirmed right upper lung SCC (TNM stage T2bNXM1c1). The patient received two cycles of albumin-bound paclitaxel, nedaplatin, and tislelizumab. A follow-up CT scan performed showed partial remission of the tumor with cavitation. After confirmation with angiography, successful embolization was performed to occlude the pseudoaneurysm and proximal artery.
