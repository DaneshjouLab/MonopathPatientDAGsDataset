A clinical case report details the presentation, diagnosis, and potential treatment strategies for a patient with Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (LUSC), a subtype of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). LUSC, also referred to as lung squamous cell carcinoma, is a type of lung cancer often associated with smokers and carries a poor prognosis.

The patient's LUSC was characterized by a TP53 mutation and the presence of a PLPP5‐FGFR1 fusion gene. FGFR fusions, including the PLPP5‐FGFR1 fusion, are known to play a role in tumor initiation and progression in some cancers. FGFR1 amplification and other FGFR fusion variants are also relevant in cancer.

The presence of the PLPP5‐FGFR1 fusion suggests a potential therapeutic target. FGFR inhibitors are a class of treatments that may be effective in tumors harboring fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) alterations. The treatment outcomes and prognosis impacts associated with FGFR fusions in LUSC are areas of active investigation. The TP53 mutation is also a factor that can influence prognosis. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of translocation partners and fusion genes in LUSC and to optimize treatment strategies for patients with these genetic alterations.
