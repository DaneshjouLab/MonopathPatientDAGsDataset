A 69-year-old male ex-smoker presented to the emergency department with acute-onset right-sided chest pain with dyspnoea. His past medical history included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease stadium-3, well controlled with medications. On presentation, his oxygen saturation was 93%. Physical examination showed no abnormalities. Initial investigations revealed a normal full blood count, normal venous blood gas, C-reactive protein levels, and no evidence of clotting disorders. Chest radiography showed no abnormal shadows. The patient was admitted to hospital for further management. On Day 2 of admission, the patientâ€™s general condition deteriorated. A CT chest angiogram revealed a 5.7 x 4.2 x 5.0 cm mass in the right pulmonary artery. No enlarged lymph nodes or signs of metastasis were found. The patient was managed as thromboembolism occlusion in the right pulmonary artery and received anticoagulation therapy, but no improvement occurred. A follow-up CT chest angiogram 2 weeks later showed no improvement of the pulmonary artery mass; however, a new finding of 1.5 cm pleural fluid in the right lung was discovered. An MRI of the chest revealed increasing pleural fluid with intraluminal filling defects involving the right pulmonary artery, citing pulmonary thromboembolism as the main differential diagnosis. A PET-CT scan revealed a large invasive obstructing homogenous mass in the right pulmonary artery with high fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake of 25.2 SUV max, no FDG uptake in mediastinal lymph nodes or other organs. Endoscopy-guided biopsy of the mass revealed non-small-cell carcinoma. The patient is receiving ongoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
