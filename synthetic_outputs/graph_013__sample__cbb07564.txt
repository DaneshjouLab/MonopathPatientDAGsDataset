A patient was diagnosed with stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and an upper esophageal stricture around the same time. An initial MRI performed two months after the NSCLC diagnosis was unremarkable. One year later, the patient presented to the emergency department with neurological weakness. A follow-up CT scan revealed metastatic spread throughout the brain.

A CT head showed multifocal intracranial lesions with vasogenic edema, indicative of metastases. The patient was admitted to the hospital and started on dexamethasone 4 mg twice daily, along with continued treatment for hypokalemia. Neutropenic precautions were initiated, with orders to start an infectious protocol and broad-spectrum antibiotics if the temperature exceeded 100.4Â°F. Pantoprazole and enoxaparin sodium were initiated for gastrointestinal and deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, respectively.

An MRI confirmed multiple new brain metastases with vasogenic edema and possible hemorrhagic components. The oncologist was consulted and confirmed metastasis to the brain and bone. Dexamethasone was increased to 6 mg every eight hours. Enoxaparin sodium was discontinued due to possible hemorrhages, and mechanical prophylaxis was started with thromboembolic deterrent stockings and sequential compression devices. The patient was discharged home and began whole brain external radiation therapy dosed at 30 Gy over 10 fractions, while docetaxel was held.

The patient tolerated radiation therapy well, and docetaxel was re-initiated. However, subsequent CT scans revealed new developments in the liver and possibly the pancreas, indicating refractory disease to second-line docetaxel. The oncologist discussed a third-line option and recommended hospice care. A brain MRI displayed numerous intracranial lesions involving bilateral cerebral hemispheres, including lesions in the anterior right frontal lobe, left frontoparietal region, and left temporal lobe, with multiple smaller lesions scattered throughout.
