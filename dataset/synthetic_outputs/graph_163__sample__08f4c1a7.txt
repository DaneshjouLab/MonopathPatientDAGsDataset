A patient in his 40s with recurrent malignant pleural mesothelioma was previously treated with 3 courses of cisplatin (CDDP, 75 mg/m2) + pemetrexed (PEM, 500 mg/m2) and 32 courses of nivolumab (240 mg/body every 2 weeks or 480 mg/body every 4 weeks). Due to disease progression, the patient was administered carboplatin (CBDCA, area under the curve 5) + pemetrexed (PEM, 500 mg/m2) as the third-line treatment. The patient rarely experienced mild akathisia-like symptoms on his feet before diagnosis and exhibited mild degradation of akathisia-like symptoms during CDDP + PEM treatment. Akathisia-like symptoms worsened to grade 2 approximately 7 days after the first cycle of CBDCA + PEM and did not disappear. Lorazepam (0.5 mg) was administered 3 times a day from day 14 but was not effective. Regular medication included 40 mg of the probiotic Clostridium butyricum MIYAIRI, 200 mg of ursodeoxycholic acid, 2 mg of tizanidine, and 2.5 g of Shakuyaku-Kanzo-To, a herbal medicine, 3 times a day, and 10 mg of vonoprazan, 1 g of multivitamin, including 0.5 mg of folic acid, 100 mg of sustained-release ferrous fumarate, and 8 mg of sustained-release hydromorphone, once a day. No significant change was reported.
