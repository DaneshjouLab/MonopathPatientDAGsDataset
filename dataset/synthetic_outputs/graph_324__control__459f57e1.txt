Following treatment with the anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab, a patient developed several immune-related adverse events. After the third infusion of pembrolizumab, the patient developed dry skin, dizziness, and fatigue. Later, based on clinical indicators including low serum free T3 and free T4 titers, an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone level, and a high titer of thyroid peroxidase autoantibody, the patient was diagnosed with immune-induced autoimmune thyroiditis. After the fifth infusion of pembrolizumab, the patient exhibited hyperglycemia, high serum ketone levels, and low arterial blood pH, meeting the criteria for immune-induced autoimmune diabetes and diabetic ketoacidosis. Following anti-PD-1 medication, the patient experienced autoimmune thyroid damage and autoimmune diabetes. As a result of these complications, the immunotherapy was discontinued, and the patient was diagnosed with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
