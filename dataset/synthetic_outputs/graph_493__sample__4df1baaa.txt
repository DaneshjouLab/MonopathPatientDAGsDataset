Here are two clinical case reports:

**Patient 3:** A 71-year-old male with occupational asbestos exposure from 1960-1980 as a carpenter was diagnosed with low grade adenocarcinoma NOS in the rectum (T3N2aM0). His BAP1 IHC score was 4 (78%), with CDKN2A Homozygous Deletion at 23% and CDKN2A Heterozygous Deletion at 64%. He was also diagnosed with Biphasic (Epithelioid adenomatoid/solid 80%) mesothelioma in the peritoneum. His BAP1 IHC score was 3 (55%), with CDKN2A Homozygous Deletion at 90% and CDKN2A Heterozygous Deletion at 10%. He was treated with FOLFOX for the adenocarcinoma and received palliative care for the mesothelioma. His overall survival was 42 months.

**Patient 4:** An 89-year-old male with occupational asbestos exposure from 1957-1975 as a welder and environmental exposure from 1971-2018 as a resident near an asbestos factory was diagnosed with low grade adenocarcinoma NOS in the rectum (T3N0M0). His BAP1 IHC score was 0 (10%), with CDKN2A Homozygous Deletion at 30% and CDKN2A Heterozygous Deletion at 73%. He was also diagnosed with Biphasic (Epithelioid solid/trabecular 70%) mesothelioma in the peritoneum. His BAP1 IHC score was 0 (0%), with CDKN2A Homozygous Deletion at 75% and CDKN2A Heterozygous Deletion at 20%. Asbestos bodies were identified in the ascitic fluid cellblock. He received palliative care for the mesothelioma. His overall survival was 5 months.

**General Observations:** Patients with both mesothelioma and intestinal carcinoma showed loss of BAP1 expression. All patients underwent surgery for colon cancer, and none received chemotherapy or radiotherapy prior to surgery. Asbestos fibres were searched in histological specimens of colorectal carcinomas. Mesothelioma samples were collected from thoracoscopic pleurectomies and omental and peritoneal biopsies.
