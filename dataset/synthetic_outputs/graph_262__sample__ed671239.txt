A 60-year-old male presented in September 2023 with a two-week history of cough. One week prior to presentation, a lung cancer diagnosis was identified during a routine check-up. Initial lung cancer diagnosis led to laboratory testing, which revealed elevated tumor markers: carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) at 156.00 ng/mL, carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA 125) at 238.00 U/mL, carbohydrate antigen 153 (CA 153) at 64.60 U/mL, cytokeratin-19 fragment (CYFRA 21-1) at 5.05 ng/mL, and squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC) at 1.80 ng/mL. Abnormal lab values prompted imaging studies to further investigate the lung cancer. Chest and abdominal CT scan showed an occupying lesion in the right upper lung, suggestive of peripheral lung cancer, as well as pathological compression fractures in the T9, T11, and L3 vertebrae. Imaging findings of bone lesions led to biopsy for confirmation of metastasis. Biopsy of the L3 bone metastasis was performed, with the pathology report indicating metastatic adenocarcinoma infiltrating bone tissue. Bone biopsy confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma, prompting immunohistochemistry and next-generation sequencing. Immunohistochemistry showed positivity for Cytokeratin7 and Villin, and negativity for Thyroid Transcription Factor-1, NapsinA, Cytokeratin20, Caudal Type Homeobox 2, Special AT-rich Sequence-Binding Protein 2, and Prostate-Specific Antigen. Next-generation sequencing revealed mutations in STK11, KRAS, and TP53. Immunohistochemistry and next-generation sequencing results informed the final diagnosis and staging. The patient was diagnosed with LUAD with bone metastasis (T1cN3M1, Stage IVB), with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 1.
