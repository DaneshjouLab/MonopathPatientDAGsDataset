A 21-year-old woman with a past medical history of pericarditis and cardiac tamponade presented to the Emergency Department after a referral from a clinic due to nausea, vomiting, ascites, lower extremity oedema, soft and watery diarrhoea, right upper quadrant pain, scleral icterus, abdominal distention, oedema, rash and joint pain.

Two months prior to presentation, the patient developed pleuritic chest pain and arthralgias and was diagnosed with cardiac tamponade. Pericardiocentesis was performed, which was negative for any malignant cells, showing only mild nonspecific inflammation. At that time, she had a negative workup for HIV, hepatitis, antinuclear antibody and Anti-Smith antibodies.

The patient was hospitalized for 10 days and discharged without medication.

The patient presented to the Emergency Room with inability to keep food down, abdominal distention after meals (improving with emesis), and a weight loss of 20 lb (approximately 9 kg) in the past month.

Systemic review showed the patient had fatigue, shortness of breath, cough, weight change and arthralgias. Physical examination showed a rash in the lower extremities and back. Heart exam showed that the point of maximal impact was not displaced.

No murmurs, gallop, or bruit were noted. There was no raised jugular venous pressure. Bilateral leg edema was present. ECG showed low voltage QRS, sinus tachycardia, and T wave abnormality. Chest X-ray showed borderline enlarged cardiomediastinal silhouette.
