A 56-year-old male with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and asymptomatic duodenal metastasis presented to the emergency department with a 5-day history of headache and dysarthria. Examination revealed mild asymmetry of his lower face and a large ventral hernia. His past medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, past hepatitis C infection, and depression. His surgical history was significant for laparoscopic cholecystectomy 7 years prior, complicated by a bile leak and intra-abdominal sepsis requiring laparotomy and washout, and a subsequent large ventral hernia. He had a significant smoking history of approximately 50 years along with intermittent cannabis use, and a previous history of intravenous drug use 20 years prior to presentation.

Non-contrast brain computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a large area of low density in the right frontoparietal region. Brain MRI revealed a rounded subcortical enhancing lesion in the right precentral gyrus with surrounding vasogenic oedema. CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis demonstrated a 6.5-cm mass in the left upper zone medially with streaky surrounding inflammatory changes in the thorax, along with several enlarged mediastinal and periportal lymph nodes. Staging FDG PET/CT revealed an area of photopenia involving the right cerebral cortex in association with a hypodensity on the low-dose CT scan due to the known brain metastasis. Staging FDG PET/CT revealed an intensely avid (SUVmax10.3) large mass in the left upper lobe, with heterogenous distribution of tracer with a central area of photopenia suggestive of central necrosis. Multiple FDG-avid mediastinal, supraclavicular, and peri-portal lymph nodes, as well as an FDG-avid left adrenal mass. An intense area of FDG avidity in the distal duodenal (D2) region (SUVmax11.8) was identified.
