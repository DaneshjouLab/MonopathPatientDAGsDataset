A patient with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) developed hilar, mediastinal lymph node, and pleural metastases. The patient experienced an inability to defecate and reported a weight loss of 20 kg. Abdominal computed tomography revealed diffuse dilatation and gas accumulation in the bowel, indicative of an incomplete intestinal obstruction. Gastroscopy showed chronic atrophic gastritis (C2) with bile reflux. Colonoscopy revealed a subpedunculated polyp approximately 1.5 cm in size, 20 cm from the anus, with smooth mucosa in the sigmoid colon. The colonoscopy also examined the descending colon at 40 cm, where the mucosa and colonic haustra were smooth; however, due to severe pain and copious dry feces, the procedure was terminated.

Laparoscopic exploration and mesenteric lymph node biopsy were performed, revealing significant bowel dilation and gas accumulation with no evidence of small bowel tumors or inflammatory diseases. Slight swelling of the small bowel mesentery and numerous enlarged lymph nodes were observed. Pathological examination of the lymph nodes revealed reactive hyperplasia.

The patient was diagnosed with a functional gastrointestinal disorder, later determined to be ICI-related GIPO (gastrointestinal immune-related adverse event). The patient tested positive for anti-Hu antibodies, leading to a diagnosis of anti-Hu antibody-related GIPO induced by serplulimab.

Treatment included intravenous methylprednisolone sodium succinate, but this provided no symptom relief. High-dose steroid pulse therapy was then administered. Ultimately, the patient died. An autopsy was performed.
