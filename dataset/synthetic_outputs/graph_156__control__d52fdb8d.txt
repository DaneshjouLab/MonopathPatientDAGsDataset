Background: Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) is a rare tumor with obscure etiopathogenesis in which different inflammatory cells and myofibroblastic spindle cells are seen histologically. The inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT), first described by Brunn in 1937, is an extremely rare type of inflammatory pseudo-tumor. In 2002 the World Health Organization classified IMT as an intermediate grade malignancy. One of the most recent discoveries is related to chromosomal translocation involving the ALK gene, which seems to be present in 50% of cases with malignant characteristics.

In April 2018, a 47-year-old woman came to our attention for dyspnea and tachycardia under exertion. A CT guided biopsy gave a diagnosis of benign lung tumor. In April 2018, the patient underwent surgery for tumor mass asportation through lateral thoracotomy. The histology of the tumor was consistent with IMT of the lung. The final histology showed an IMT of the lung.

Our work aims to detect the presence of cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) in a case of IMT of the lung by immunohistochemical testing for the most common CSCs markers, with aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), as well as for the presence of pluripotent transcription factors such as OCT4, SOX-2, NANOG, and C-MYC, which modulate biological CSC activities. The ALDEFLUOR assay, after tissue digestion, was used to identify and sort human lung cancer cells expressing high and low aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity. Immunohistochemically assessed cell positivity for ALDH1A1, SOX2, NANOG, OCT-4, and c-MYC, which are considered as lung cancer stem-like cells markers. ALDHhigh Stem Cells Were Identified in Primary Cells of an IMT of the Lung. Tumor tissue dissociation efficiently released cancer cells characterized by a heterogeneous morphology, as illustrated in the widespread FSC and SSC values. FACS analysis. Cytofluorimetric analysis of ALDHhigh cells in a case of lung myofibroblastic tumor. Immunohistochemical Evaluation of the ALDH1A1, SOX2.

For the first time, we demonstrated the presence of cancer stem cells in a case of IMT of the lung. Patient underwent follow up and no recurrence was observed within a year after surgery. This perspective suggests further studies to understand the possibility of developing recurrence depending on the presence of cancer stem cells.
