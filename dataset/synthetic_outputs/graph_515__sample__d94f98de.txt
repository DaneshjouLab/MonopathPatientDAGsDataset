In October 2015, a 70-year-old never-smoking female presented with cough and dyspnoea during exercise. CT and 18F-FDG-PET showed a spiculated nodule in the lingula of the lung, additional bilateral pulmonary nodules and enlarged locoregional lymph nodes. Primary adenocarcinoma of the lung was diagnosed by BAL and biopsy of a bronchial mass (TNM staging (7th edition): cT4, cN3, cM1a, stage IV). NGS revealed a classical EGFR mutation in exon 21 (p.L858R;c.2573T > G). MET amplification (mean gene copy number 9; MET/CEN7-ratio 2.4) was detected by FISH. In November 2015, the patient started on first-line erlotinib (150 mg daily). By February 2016, the patient complained about increasing cough and dyspnoea due to pulmonary progression. Molecular testing of carcinoma cells from BAL showed no EGFR T790M mutation. The patient started on carboplatin and pemetrexed followed by pemetrexed maintenance, resulting in a partial remission for 32 months.
