A 76-year-old man was referred to our hospital with a cough. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a 45-mm mass in the lingular segment of the left upper lobe. Transbronchial tumor biopsies showed adenocarcinoma. Contrast-enhanced CT and bone scintigraphy revealed lung, pleura, and bone metastases. The patient was diagnosed with left upper lobe adenocarcinoma cT2bN3M1c stage IVB. A genetic analysis of the primary tumor using the Oncomine Dx Target Test Multi-CDx system revealed positivity for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (L858R) and CTNNB1 mutations. Based on these findings, the patient was treated with osimertinib (80 mg/day) as first-line therapy. Six months later, the tumor increased in size, indicating progressive disease. Osimertinib was stopped and second-line therapy with carboplatin (area under the curve 5) and pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) was initiated. After three cycles of chemotherapy, the patient developed dementia and disorientation. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the head showed miliary brain metastases. The patient was treated with whole brain irradiation; however, his symptoms rapidly progressed and he was transferred to palliative care.
