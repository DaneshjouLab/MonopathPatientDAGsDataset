A male patient in his 70s presented with a nodular shadow in the left lung field on chest radiography. A subsequent CT scan revealed a 3.7 cm mass in the left lower lobe adjacent to the diaphragm and a 1.7 cm mass in the lingula, both closely associated with the pleura. Thoracoscopic lung biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). The disease was staged as stage IV due to the multifocal pleural involvement and the risk of intrathoracic spread.

The patient received four cycles of cisplatin (CDDP; 75 mg/m²) and pemetrexed (PEM; 500 mg/m²). Following this, the patient received PEM monotherapy (500 mg/m²) every three weeks for a total of 25 courses, starting one year after diagnosis and continuing until the third year. In the third year following diagnosis, the patient commenced nivolumab therapy (200 mg every two weeks), continuing until the fifth year (50 courses).

Despite chemotherapy, pleural lesions gradually increased in size, and a right adrenal metastasis appeared. The patient's primary complaint was abdominal discomfort in the left abdominal region. A CT scan revealed a lesion in the pleura in the vicinity of the 10th and 11th ribs. An abdominal CT image after chemotherapy showed multiple pleural lesions exhibited increased size and extended specifically between the 10th and 11th intercostal spaces, resulting in abdominal discomfort on the left side. Metastasis to the right adrenal gland was evident on imaging.

Radiation therapy (RT) was administered to pleural lesions in the 10th and 11th intercostal spaces on the left chest wall using three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT), delivering a total dose of 39 Gy in 13 fractions, which effectively alleviated the pain. Four months later, 3DCRT was performed to treat the right adrenal gland, delivering 30 Gy in 10 fractions. Finally, 20 Gy in five fractions was administered to pleural lesions in the ninth intercostal space.
