A 39-year-old female presented in January 2021 with a one-month history of increasing dyspnea and left shoulder discomfort. The dyspnea was aggravated with sleep, but was not accompanied by fever, chest discomfort, nausea, vomiting, or weight loss. The patient had a prior rhinoplasty. There was no history of smoking or cancer in the family.

Physical examination revealed diminished breathing sounds at the base of the left lung. Laboratory results showed a WBC count of 19.9 × 109/L, hemoglobin of 10.9 g/dl, platelets of 521 × 109/L, BUN of 10 mg/dl, creatinine of 0.8 mg/dl, blood sugar of 120 mg/dl, sodium of 141 mEq/L, and potassium of 4.3 mEq/L. A chest x-ray showed opacification of the left lung. A CT scan of the chest revealed a left-sided pleural effusion and minimal pleural thickening, without parenchymal abnormalities. Electrocardiography and echocardiogram showed no cardiac abnormalities.

Based on these findings, the patient underwent therapeutic and diagnostic thoracentesis.

Pleural fluid analysis revealed a total count of 3100 cells with malignant cells, RBC count of 2400, WBC count of 700 (lymphocyte 40% and neutrophil 60%), fluid lactate dehydrogenase 299 IU/L, negative adenosine deaminase and culture. A repeat CT scan of the lungs confirmed the left-sided pleural effusion and minimal pleural thickening, without accompanying parenchymal abnormalities. Pleuroscopy revealed multiple creamy nodular lesions on the visceral and parietal pleura. Multiple biopsies were taken, the pleural effusion was drained, and a chest tube was inserted.

The patient was discharged after chest tube removal and instructed to visit the pulmonologist when biopsy results were ready.

Five days later, the patient was readmitted to the hospital due to dyspnea. The patient was ultimately diagnosed with Pleural epithelioid hemangioendothelioma.
