A 21-year-old female was admitted with unclear diffuse abdominal pain. The patient underwent transvaginal ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen and pelvis, which demonstrated multiple functional cysts in the right and left ovaries, and free fluid inside the vesicouterine and rectouterine excavation. The right ovary measured 3.5x2.7 cm and left ovary 3.3x2.6 cm. Subsequently, the patient underwent laparoscopy, which revealed a multicystic tumor with thin, smooth walls, filled with clear serous content in the lesser pelvis spreading into the left paracolic region and under the spleen. The multicystic mass was removed via laparoscopy with complete resection. Cytologic analysis of the cystic fluid showed clusters of fibroblasts, histiocytes and eosinophils with no malignant cells found. Histopathologic analysis showed cystic formations filled with mucous content and formed from connective tissue outside and single row epithelium-mesothelium inside. Immunohistochemical stains were positive for calretinin, CK5/6 and CA125, leading to a definitive diagnosis of Benign Multicystic Peritoneal Mesothelioma (BMPM). The patient presented for regular check-ups and was well, with no signs of recurrence at one-year follow-up.
