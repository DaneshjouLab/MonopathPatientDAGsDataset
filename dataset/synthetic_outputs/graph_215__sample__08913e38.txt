A 55-year-old male with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) undergoing durvalumab therapy, with a history of membranous nephropathy (MN), experienced nephrotic syndrome (NS) relapse during PD-L1 inhibitor therapy. Eight years prior to the diagnosis of NSCLC, the patient developed NS. The patient was found to have severe generalized swelling. Urinalysis showed major proteinuria, which prompted nephrology referral. The patient, with a medical history of hypertension, tobacco-use disorder, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and depression, presented with moderate pitting edema of the lower extremities. Initial laboratory evaluation revealed serum albumin 2.2 g/dL, LDL 316 mg/dL, creatinine 0.9 mg/dL, 24-h urine protein 11190 mg, and HCV RNA viral load of 6.2 log IU/mL with genotype 3a. Serum protein electrophoresis showed no monoclonal proteins. Chest X-ray showed no active disease. Renal biopsy revealed patent glomeruli with subtle accumulation of eosinophilic material along the subepithelial surfaces of the silver-staining glomerular basement membranes, with rare silver-positive spike formation. The tubular parenchyma showed no obvious abnormalities, and there was no significant sclerosis or hyalinosis in the arterial vessels. Immunofluorescence (IF) showed granular glomerular basement staining for immunoglobulin G (IgG; 3+), IgA (2â€“3+), complement 3 (C3; 1+), kappa light chain (3+) and lambda light chain (3+). Electron microscopy revealed thickened capillary basement membranes due to the accumulation of numerous subepithelial discrete electron-dense deposits, along with diffuse podocyte foot process effacement. Findings were compatible with MN.
