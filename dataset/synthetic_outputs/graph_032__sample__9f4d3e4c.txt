A 69-year-old male presented to the Affiliated Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine of Southwest Medical University (SWMU) with chest pain. The chest pain affected the subxiphoid process and the posterior back, occurring frequently and lasting for several minutes. The patient's medical history included coronary heart disease (CHD), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and pulmonary emphysema. His current medications included indobufen, clopidogrel bisulfate, metoprolol succinate sustained-release, rosuvastatin calcium, vonoprazan fumarate, and rebamipide. He had a 30-year history of smoking (average 10 cigarettes/day) but had abstained for 20 years. He occasionally consumed alcohol, 4–8 times monthly. Physical examination revealed a palpably enlarged lymph node on the left supraclavicular bone, approximately 1.5 × 1.5 cm in size, hard, with poor mobility, ill-defined margins, and no tenderness. Further physical exam revealed hyperresonance on percussion sounds and weakened respiratory sounds without rales. A 3.0 x 3.0 cm hard, tender mass with clear borders was detected in the anterior branch of the left 5th rib. The abdomen was slightly depressed, with epigastric tenderness without rebound pain or muscle tension. A chest CT showed a nodule in the anterior segment of the upper lobe of the right lung.
