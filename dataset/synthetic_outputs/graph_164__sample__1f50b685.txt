Here is a reconstructed clinical case report based on the provided data:

A 65-year-old male with small-cell lung carcinoma, diagnosed 6 months prior, was scheduled for pericardial-window-opening surgery (lateral thoracotomy approach). Emergency preoperative evaluation revealed severe chronic obstructive chest disease, bilateral malignant pleural effusion in the lungs and pericardial effusion, deemed too risky for general anesthesia. His heart rate was 126 bpm, blood pressure 75/35 mmHg, and SpO2 75%. The patient had no comorbidities, no history of surgery or allergy, but a smoking history of 100 pack years. Complete blood count, coagulation functions, and biochemical parameters were normal. Vital signs were monitored using three-lead electrocardiography and noninvasive blood pressure and SpO2 monitors. Peripheral venous access was established, and saline infusion started at 30 cm3/h. Oxygen was delivered at 4 l/min via oxygen mask. The patient was placed in semi-Fowler position. An ultrasound system was used with a 6-18 MHz linear probe. The needle puncture point was anesthetized with 2% lidocaine. A 21-ga, 10-cm stimulating needle was introduced under ultrasound guidance. After negative aspiration, the plane between the latissimus dorsi and serratus anterior muscles was filled with 15 cm3 of 0.5% bupivacaine plus 5 cm3 saline in 5 cm3 aliquots. 4 cm3 of 0.5% bupivacaine was injected in the fifth and sixth intercostal region for additional analgesia. Adequate analgesia in the operation zone involving the dermatomes T3â€“T6 was confirmed. Surgery commenced. The surgery was performed via semi-oblique incision in the fourth intercostal region. Intravenous administration of 2 mg midazolam and 30 mg propofol was given. No severe hypotension or arrhythmia occurred. The patient reported no pain, even without local anesthetics. Ventilation was supported manually as needed; spontaneous breathing was maintained. The surgery lasted 45 minutes. The patient was fully orientated and cooperative upon transfer to postanesthesia care unit for postoperative follow-up.

Separately, a 63-year-old male patient presented with severe chest pain of the left hemithorax following a motor vehicle accident. He had a BMI of 44 and a history of diabetes mellitus, high blood pressure, and obstructive sleep apnea. He sustained broken fourth to seventh ribs without pneumothorax or hemothorax. He was unable to lie supine. A serratus anterior plane block was performed with the patient in the sitting position due to his inability to lie supine. The patient experienced no pain for 10 h postoperatively.

In another case, an 82-year-old man fell onto a table and fractured his fourth to ninth right ribs.

Finally, a 65-year-old woman was struck by a car and sustained fractured fifth to seventh left ribs. A serratus anterior plane block was performed in the posterior axillary line using an 18-ga Touhy needle to inject 20 cm3 of 0.125% bupivacaine followed by a continuous infusion. The patient's pain began to diminish 15 min after the procedure, and she was able to undergo respiratory physiotherapy. In a separate instance, the serratus plane block was administered to patients in the lateral decubitus position toward the posterior axillary line using 30 cm3 of 0.5% ropivacaine.
