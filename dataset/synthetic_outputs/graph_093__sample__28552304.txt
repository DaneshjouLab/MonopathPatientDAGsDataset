A 65-year-old female presented with a 10-month history of low-back/lumbar pain. This was followed by a dry cough ongoing for the last six months and a mass in the right supraclavicular space that developed three months after the initial cough symptoms. The patient has a past medical history of hypothyroidism and is a needlewoman. Current medications include levothyroxine, analgesics (hydromorphone and pregabalin), and dalteparin 11500 IU for thrombosis of the mesenteric vein.

Physical exam revealed increased anteroposterior diameter of the thorax, decreased bilateral breath sounds, digital hypocratism, and a 3.5 x 3.5 cm mass in the supraclavicular space without neurological alterations. Chest CT showed a 3 x 3 cm lung mass in the paratracheal space, polyostotic compromise, and a second mass in the left lower lobe. Abdominal CT showed thrombosis of the mesenteric vein. Bronchoscopic biopsy of the lung mass was performed.

Bronchoscopic biopsy of the lung mass was consistent with adenocarcinoma (ADC) of the lung. Pathology showed primary pulmonary adenocarcinoma (ADC). Immunohistochemistry was positive for napsin, thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), CK7, and AE1/AE3, and negative for p40, CK20, and CD56. EGFR gene mutations in exon 18 (g719x) and 20 (s768i) were found.
