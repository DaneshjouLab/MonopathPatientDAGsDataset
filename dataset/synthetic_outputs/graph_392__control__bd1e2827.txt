Pulmonary carcinosarcoma (PCS) is a rare type of non-small cell cancer, predominantly affecting middle-aged and older smokers. The diagnosis of PCS is challenging due to the absence of characteristic imaging findings, and preoperative biopsies often fail to reflect the tumor's heterologous nature. Prognostic factors remain undefined, and the overall prognosis is poor with limited therapeutic options.

This case report describes a rare instance of metastatic PCS that was incidentally discovered through imaging and accurately diagnosed following surgical resection. The report further discusses the clinicopathological features, diagnostic tools, genetic theories, prognosis, and therapeutic options associated with this rare cancer.

Pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma (PSC), a rare primary non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), encompasses five subtypes according to the World Health Organization (WHO): pleomorphic carcinoma, spindle cell carcinoma, giant cell carcinoma, pulmonary blastoma, and carcinosarcoma. Carcinosarcoma (CS) is characterized by a biphasic histopathological pattern with malignant epithelial and sarcomatous mesenchymal components. While CS can occur in various organs, pulmonary carcinosarcoma (PCS) presents as a symptomatic mass within the endobronchial tree or as an incidental mass in the peripheral lung parenchyma. Preoperative diagnosis is difficult, as biopsies often reveal only one element of the tumor, leading to misdiagnosis and delayed treatment of these aggressive tumors.
