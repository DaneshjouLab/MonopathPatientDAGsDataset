An 80-year-old man with a 5-year history of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs) presented with a tumour shadow detected on a chest CT scan performed at an outside hospital. His peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) was 96%, and his modified Medical Research Council dyspnea scale score was 1. Laboratory results showed a Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6) level of 703 U/L.

Further investigation revealed a slightly elevated rheumatoid factor level of 15 IU/mL, while other autoantibodies associated with connective tissue diseases were not detected. A repeat chest CT revealed a tumour shadow in the upper lobe of the right lung against a background of bilateral preexisting interstitial pneumonia, likely with a usual interstitial pneumonia pattern. Bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy confirmed lung cancer in the setting of IIPs, with a high confidence of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Laboratory data at the time of lung cancer diagnosis included: WBC 6700 /µL, Neut 70.3 %, Lymph 23.8 %, Mono 4.3 %, Eosin 0.9 %, Baso 0.7 %, RBC 480 × 104 /µL, Hb 14.4 g/dL, Ht 43.4 %, Plt 28.8 × 104 /µL, TP 7.2 g/dL, Alb 4.2 g/dL, T-Bil 0.6 mg/dL, AST 18 U/L, ALT 18 U/L, LDH 182 U/L, CK 90 U/L, γ-GTP 28 U/L, Na 140 mEq/L, K 4.8 mEq/L, Cl 107 mEq/L, Ca 10.3 mg/dL, BUN 13.2 mg/dL, Cr 0.79 mg/dL, CRP 0.16 mg/dL, CEA 82.1 ng/mL, CYFRA 5.4 U/mL, Pro-GRP 47.1 pg/mL, ANA 1:40 titre, and MPO-ANCA <2.0 U/mL.

Additional labs showed PR3-ANCA <0.6 U/L, Anti-ARS <5.0 Index, Anti-MDA5 <4.0 Index, PT-INR 0.93, and aPTT 28.7 Sec. Eighteen days post-bronchoscopy, an 18F-FDG PET/CT revealed newly identified scattered bilateral ground-glass opacities (GGOs) in the lung fields, in addition to the original interstitial lesions. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) in the lung interstitial lesions, including new GGOs, was 7.9 and 9.1 in the early and delayed phase, respectively, exceeding new GGOs fields, especially in the delayed phase.

Laboratory results showed elevated C-reactive protein at 6.14 mg/dL and KL-6 at 884 U/L. The patient was diagnosed with a respiratory infection and treated with antibiotics.

Nine days after starting antibiotics, a repeat 18F-FDG PET/CT showed extensively spread GGOs with consolidations in the bilateral lung fields, accompanied by respiratory failure and worsening KL-6 levels. Chest CT showed increased extension of bilateral GGOs and consolidations, reaching the regions of 18F-FDG accumulation in the delayed phase.

Nine days after the second 18F-FDG PET/CT scan, the patient was admitted to the hospital for respiratory failure, requiring oxygen administration at 4 L/min via nasal cannula. Laboratory results revealed further elevated levels of C-reactive protein (8.33 mg/dL).
