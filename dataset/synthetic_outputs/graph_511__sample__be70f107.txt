An 83-year-old male was admitted on October 30, 2019, with a one-week history of cough, expectoration, and hemoptysis. His medical history included tuberculosis for more than 30 years, chronic bronchitis, and emphysema for 10 years.

Chest CT revealed an irregular mass (5.3×2.6 cm) in the upper lobe of the left lung. PET/CT showed multiple lymph node and bone metastases.

Transthoracic core needle biopsy of the lung mass showed tumor cell characteristics with adenoid and stratified structures and visible nuclear division. Immunohistochemistry was positive for TTF-1, CK7, SPA, napsin-A and Ki-67 (10%), and negative for villin, P63 and P40. The patient was diagnosed with stage IV (T4aN2M1) invasive lung adenocarcinoma.

On December 6, 2019, next-generation sequencing (NGS) identified a novel PTH2R-ALK fusion in the patient’s tumor tissue, composed of exon 1 of the PTH2R gene and exons 20–29 of the ALK gene. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) confirmed ALK positivity.

The patient started oral crizotinib 250 mg twice daily (BID) from December 12, 2019. After 10 days, the patient developed mild nausea without vomiting.

Liver function reexamination revealed elevated ALT and AST levels (3-4 times higher than baseline), indicating mild liver function impairment. He was treated with polyene phosphatidylcholine for liver protection.

A follow-up CT on January 18, 2020, showed the left lung mass decreased to 1.47x0.89 cm, indicating a partial response to treatment.

NGS results showed the PTH2R-ALK fusion breakpoint. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) image showed a split signal with a frequency of 25% (400x magnification).
