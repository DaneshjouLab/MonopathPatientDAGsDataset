A 67-year-old man with a 47-pack-year smoking history was diagnosed with primary lung adenocarcinoma (pT1cN2M0 Stage IIIA) after a right upper lobectomy in March 2022. His PD-L1 tumor proportion score was 1%â€“24%, and no druggable driver oncogenes were identified. Following four cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin and vinorelbine, he received 15 cycles of atezolizumab maintenance therapy until June 2023. In July 2023, he was admitted to the hospital with right homonymous hemianopsia and hemiplegia. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a metastatic lesion in the occipital lobe. The metastatic lesion in the occipital lobe was resected via craniotomy and subsequently irradiated. The tumor was diagnosed as small cell lung cancer (SCLC) with no adenocarcinoma components. Computed tomography revealed multiple liver metastases. Serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was elevated due to metastases but rapidly decreased after brain tumor resection by craniotomy. He was treated with four cycles of durvalumab combined with cisplatin and etoposide, followed by maintenance therapy with durvalumab. Sustained tumor regression was observed, with a 13-month progression-free survival (PFS) as of September 2024.
