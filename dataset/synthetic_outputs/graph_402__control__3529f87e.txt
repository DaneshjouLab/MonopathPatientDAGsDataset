A 70-year-old woman, a current 75-pack-year smoker, presented to our hospital with mild cognitive impairment and an abnormal chest shadow. Enhanced brain magnetic resonance imaging and chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a 40-mm mass in the brain and a 100-mm mass in the lower lobe of the right side of the lung. Histologic examination of specimens obtained by means of craniotomy and bronchoscopy revealed identical SqCC.
