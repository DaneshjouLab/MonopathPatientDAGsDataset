A 70-year-old male presented with suspected primary lung cancer (clinical stage T1bN0M0, stage IA2) based on a chest radiograph during a physical examination. He was undergoing inhalation therapy for emphysema. Chest x-ray revealed a nodule in the right upper lung field, without cardiac enlargement. Chest CT revealed severe lung emphysema and an 11 mm pure solid tumor in the right S3 segment. Preoperative contrast CT revealed abnormal return of the right V1–3 directly into the superior vena cava (SVC), with V4 + 5 and the inferior pulmonary vein returning normally to the left atrium. The bronchial and pulmonary artery branches of the right upper lobe were normal. Preoperative forced expiratory volume in 1 s/forced vital capacity ratio was 58.7%. There were no signs of heart failure, and echocardiogram was normal, with a pulmonary-to-systemic blood flow ratio (Qp/Qs) of 1.4 and a tricuspid regurgitation pressure gradient of 35 mmHg, without an atrial septal defect. Robot-assisted right S3 segmentectomy was performed with five ports and CO2 insufflation pressure under 8 mmHg. The A3a, A3b, V3, and B3 were dissected during S3 segmentectomy, located caudal to V2. Operation time was 149 min with a blood loss of 3 mL. During the robot-assisted right S3 segmentectomy, B3 was located on the caudal side of abnormal V1–3 within the space between A3 and A2b. V2 was located just behind V3 and V1b after V3 and V1b were clipped and divided. After dividing V1b, V3, A3a, A3b, and B3, the lung parenchyma of the S3 segment was dissected using a stapler.
