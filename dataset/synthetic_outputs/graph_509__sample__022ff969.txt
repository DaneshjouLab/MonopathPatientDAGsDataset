A 63-year-old woman with a smoking history of 20 pack-years, alcoholic liver injury, and hypertension presented with cough and hoarseness. A chest X-ray showed left hilar enlargement. Chest CT revealed a 5-cm mass in the left upper lobe and 8-cm diameter mediastinal lymph node swelling. Serum tumor markers were elevated: pro-GRP (4,490 pg/mL; normal range, <46 pg/mL) and NSE (138 ng/mL; normal range, <10 ng/mL). Serum levels of aspartate transferase (35 IU/L) and creatine kinase (57 U/L) were within normal limits, while those of lactate dehydrogenase (286 IU/L) and C-reactive protein (0.57 mg/dL) were slightly increased. Pathology of biopsy specimens obtained from the mediastinal lymph node and left main tumor by flexible bronchoscopy revealed SCLC. Systemic image analysis showed no distant metastasis, diagnosed with limited stage SCLC. Systemic chemoradiotherapy with carboplatin plus etoposide was initiated, leading to a significant reduction in the tumor size in the lung and mediastinal lymph node on chest X-ray and a decrease in the levels of serum tumor markers. The patient was discharged without any clinical signs or symptoms of PM/DM at 27 days after chemotherapy.
