A patient presented with acute abdomen pain, abdominal pain, and severe abdominal pain, indicating a possible bowel obstruction. The patient also reported difficult evacuation, bloody vomiting, and weight loss. Further symptoms included fever and abdominal distention, accompanied by nausea, constipation, and diarrhea.

Physical examination revealed a large abdominal mass that was painful on palpation, along with signs of peritonitis. Laboratory findings showed a hemoglobin level of 10.5g/dL, and Prothrombin time, partial thromboplastine time and INR (International Normalized Ratio) were slightly increased. Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) level was 0,52ng/mL and Carbohydrate Antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) was 3,92U/mL.

Imaging revealed a cystic lesion causing compression of intestinal loops. These findings were consistent with a mesenteric cyst. During surgical exploration, peritoneum and small bowel adhesions were noted. The final diagnosis was benign cystic mesothelioma of the mesentery.

The patient's condition deteriorated, leading to acute abdomen. The mesenteric cyst experienced spontaneous rupture, resulting in infection and hemorrhage, potentially due to cyst torsion.
