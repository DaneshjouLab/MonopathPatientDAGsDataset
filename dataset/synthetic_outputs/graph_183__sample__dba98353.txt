In July 2020, an examination revealed that the patient had brain metastases. The patient subsequently underwent four courses of sintilimab and anlotinib between July 2020 and August 2020. After the second course of chemotherapy in August 2020, the patient reported mild dry eyes. By September 2020, the eye dryness became obvious and difficult to relieve. In November 2020, the patient experienced vision loss, with visual acuity in both eyes measured at 0.5. Due to the unsatisfactory treatment outcome, the patient visited the ophthalmology clinic of The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine. The patient complained about redness, pain, and vision loss in the left eye, which had started a month prior. Visual acuity in the right eye was 0.5, and visual acuity in the left eye was 0.3. Slit lamp examination revealed a red and edematous left eyelid, conjunctival hyperemia, old leukoplakia in the center of the cornea, thinning of the leukoplakia, focal thinning of the cornea at 1 oâ€™clock, focal anterior adhesion of the iris, and lens opacity in the left eye. Anterior segment photo and optical coherence tomography (OCT) image of the left eye showed corneal thinning of the defect area. A corneal ulcer was diagnosed. The patient was then given bandage contact lenses and recombinant bovine basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) eye drops. Keratograph 5M revealed an imbalance.
