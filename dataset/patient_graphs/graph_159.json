He has emphysematous chronic bronchitis and a history of heavy smoking (35 packs/year before quitting). He worked as a war correspondent in the Balkans, Iraq, and Afghanistan for about 10 years starting in the early 1990s. He is a social drinker with a physically active lifestyle. Patient's family history is positive for cancers: both parents had lung cancer, and two sisters had breast cancer. The patient worked in an urban office since 2003 and lived for many months among the rubble of bombed-out buildings constructed mainly in the 1950s and 1960s with the extensive use of asbestos during each mission.",
