A 58-year-old male presented with cough and dyspnea for several months. He is a long-time smoker with a 31 pack-year history. Pleurocentesis was performed, with cytologic studies demonstrating atypical cells with hyperchromatic nuclei, prominent nucleoli and abundant eosinophilic and granular cytoplasm consistent with adenocarcinoma. CEA level was 2260 ng/ml (reference value [RV]: <5.0 ng/ml). Chest CT revealed a 6.0-cm long poorly-defined right lower pulmonary lobe tumor with surrounding atelectasis and ipsilateral pleural effusion and a small contralateral pulmonary metastasis. Whole-body CT scan and bone scintigraphy revealed metastases involving the bones, pleura, left lung, and brain. No tumor in the liver was detected and the liver was not cirrhotic. Fine needle biopsy of the right pulmonary lower lobe tumor revealed neoplastic cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and round nuclei arranged concentrically in a solid structure with central necrosis. Immunohistochemistry: TTF-1 negative, Napsin A negative, CK 5/6 negative, p40 negative, CK7 positive, pCEA positive and mCEA positive, rendering the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of unknown origin. Three cycles of S-1 chemotherapy (tegafur, 5-chloro-2,4-dihydroxypyridine, and potassium oxonate) were administered, with tumor size reduction. Adjuvant radiotherapy and narcotic analgesia were administered. CT scan at 6 months after diagnosis revealed an increasing size of the tumors in both lungs.
