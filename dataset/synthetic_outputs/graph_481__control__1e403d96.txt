A 65-year-old male ex-smoker presented with left shoulder pain and abnormalities on chest radiography. Computed tomography revealed a left apical mass (4 cm). He had a history of tracheostomy due to purulent tonsillitis 10 years prior. His pulmonary function was normal (forced expiratory volume in 1 second 105%; diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide 121%). A transbronchial biopsy specimen revealed squamous cell carcinoma. A fluorine 18-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography did not show any nodal or distant metastases. Endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsy of the mediastinal lymph nodes (stations 4R and 7 were sampled; 4L was not amenable to biopsy due to its small size) were negative for malignancy. Tumor invasion of the left subclavian vein and the sternal attachment of the first rib and anterior aspect of the second rib was observed (cT4N0M0). Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the invasion of the chest wall and the vein, but it did not show apparent invasion to the left subclavian artery nor the brachial plexus. A left subclavian vein thrombus was also detected. The patient underwent anterior transclavicular approach (the Dartevelle approach) for non–small cell lung cancer invading the anatomical territory in the vicinity of the sternoclavicular joint. The approach facilitated resection of lung cancer close to the sternoclavicular joint. Lobectomy was performed through a single thoracotomy to preserve shoulder motion. Complete surgical resection following chemoradiation is recommended in patients with resectable non–small cell lung cancer that invades the superior sulcus.
