A patient with a 7-year postdiagnosis of mesothelioma, performance status of zero, chronically distorted intrathoracic anatomy due to previous mesothelioma surgery, a dehisced diaphragmatic patch, and a loculated pneumothorax underwent indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) placement in chronic right hydropneumothorax. One and a half hours postprocedure, the patient had a witnessed sudden drop in conscious level with associated seizure-like activity. The patient was assessed by the cardiac arrest team. Blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen saturations were maintained within the reference range. Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was 4 (eyes opening 1, verbal response 1 and motor response 2). General examination did not demonstrate any peripheral stigmata of systemic air embolism and no retinal air bubbles were seen in funduscopic examination. Acute stroke was suspected. An urgent CT head was performed. Repeat blood tests revealed: WCC 9.4 x 10^9/L, haemoglobin 107 g/L, platelet 408 x 10^9/L, blood urea 4.0 mmol/L, serum creatinine 73 umol/L, estimated glomerular filtration rate >90, C reactive protein 70 mg/L, alanine transaminase 9 iu/L. ECG showed sinus rhythm with no ischaemic changes. CT head revealed multiple serpiginous pockets of air along the cerebral fissure, suggestive of an embolism, and multiple wedge-shaped areas of infarction involving the cerebral hemispheres. CT chest revealed satisfactory positioning of the IPC with no aetiology for the acute deterioration. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for high flow oxygen therapy and head down ventilation.
