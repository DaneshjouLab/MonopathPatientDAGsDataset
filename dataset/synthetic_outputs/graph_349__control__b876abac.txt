A patient with stage 3 non-small cell lung carcinoma received durvalumab (10 mg/kg, every 2 weeks by intravenous infusion), a programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) inhibitor, as adjuvant treatment following concurrent chemo radiotherapy. After 43 weeks and 21 cycles of durvalumab, the patient developed salivary gland (SG) dysfunction, specifically an inability to produce unstimulated or stimulated parotid gland saliva, resulting in dry mouth. A biopsy of the salivary glands was performed. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed an absence of classical AQP5+ CK7− acinar cell clusters, but instead showed hybrid epithelial structures with intercalated duct-like morphology containing a mixture of AQP5+CK7−, AQP5−CK7+, and AQP5+CK7+ cells. These structures were more frequent than in sicca control and primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) tissue. The hybrid structures contained proliferating (Ki67+) and senescent (p16+) cells. Striated ducts showed no abnormal morphology, unlike in pSS tissue. PD-L1 expression was detected in the SG parenchyma. The SG also demonstrated focal lymphocytic sialadentitis, harboring disperse and focal CD4+ T cell-rich infiltrates, along with CD8+ T cells. CD20+ B-cells were infrequently detected, contrasting with their abundance in pSS SG tissue. Although the patient fulfilled criteria for pSS and demonstrated focal lymphocytic sialadentitis, the histopathological characteristics did not fully resemble pSS.
