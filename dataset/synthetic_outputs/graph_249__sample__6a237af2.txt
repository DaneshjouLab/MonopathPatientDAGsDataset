A 65-year-old man presented with right forearm pain and paralysis of his right-hand fingers. Physical examination revealed right forearm swelling and drop finger with no sensory deficits in the fingers. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a right forearm mass. Further investigation with chest x-ray and computed tomography identified a right upper lobe mass and right renal tumour. All masses were histologically identified as non-small cell lung cancer. Posterior interosseous nerve (PIN) palsy secondary to lung cancer metastasis was diagnosed. The patient tested positive for MET exon 14 skipping mutation. Palliative radiation therapy (30 Gy in 10 fractions) was administered to the forearm tumour, followed by systemic tepotinib therapy. Despite tumour size reduction, the drop finger showed no improvement. Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging of the right forearm showed a 9 cm x 4 cm lesion near the radius with suspected posterior interosseous nerve invasion. Chest x-ray showed a large tumour in the right upper lung field. Chest enhanced computed tomography showed a tumour lesion in the right upper lobe and enlargement of the mediastinal lymph node #4R. Palliative radiation was then opted to alleviate pain.
