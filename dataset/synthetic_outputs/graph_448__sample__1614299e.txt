A patient presented with a right peritoneal cyst. An initial CT scan ruled out hydronephrosis but revealed bilateral cystic masses. This led to further investigation, and a pathology report demonstrated bilateral peritoneal (multilocular) inclusion cysts. Pelvic MRI demonstrated non-complicated cystic lesions bilaterally, most likely peritoneal inclusion cysts, and uterine duplication anomalies. To alleviate symptoms, the patient underwent cyst drainage under interventional radiology, draining brown fluid. Pathology showed no evidence of malignant cells. The patient's pain level decreased, and she was discharged home. Two weeks later, the patient had the same complaint, and her abdominal pain became more severe, but there were no signs of infection. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed fluid reaccumulating within the cyst. The patient then underwent laparotomy with bilateral excision of the peritoneal inclusion cyst; the sigmoid colon was injured intraoperatively by a less than 1 cm laceration. Post-operatively, a colocutaneous fistula and pelvic collections developed. The fistula was managed conservatively for two weeks with complete resolution, and the fluid collections were drained by interventional radiology.
