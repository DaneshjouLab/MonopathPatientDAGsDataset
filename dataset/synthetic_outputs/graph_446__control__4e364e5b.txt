A 55-year-old woman with non-small cell lung carcinoma presented with a five-year history of epigastric pain, bloating, anorexia, nausea, and recurrent non-bloody, non-projectile postprandial vomiting. The patient exhibited emaciation, with a weight of 43 kg, height of 158 cm, and body mass index of 17.2 kg/m2. It was considered that the compression of the duodenum between the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and abdominal aorta (AA) in the patient resulted in intermittent duodenal obstruction. This case represents a rare anatomical abnormality in which the distance between the SMA and AA is unusually short, resulting in the third part of the duodenum being compressed between the two vessels, producing symptoms of duodenal obstruction and compression. This scenario reveals a distinctive case characterized by duodenal compression between the AA and SMV, culminating in the episodic manifestation of duodenal obstruction.
