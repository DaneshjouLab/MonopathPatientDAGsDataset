In April 2021, a 61-year-old female patient was admitted for evaluation of chest tightness and a cough. Physical examination revealed diminished breath sounds, and dry rales were heard in the right lower lung. The patient had grade 3 hypertension (very high risk), no other diseases, no family history of tumors, and no history of smoking. Chest CT revealed a mass in the lower lobe of the right lung with a distal obstructive lesion, measuring 83 mm in maximum diameter, suspected to be lung cancer. At the same time, multiple enlarged lymph nodes were noted in the right supraclavicular fossa, mediastinum, and the right hilar region of the lung. Brain MRI revealed brain metastasis in the left occipital lobe. Postoperative pathology confirmed adenocarcinoma of the lower lobe of the right lung (T2N3M1, stage IV). Subsequently, genetic testing using high-throughput sequencing identified an EGFR exon 21 L858R mutation with 80% abundance, accompanied by TP53 and RB1 mutations. The patient subsequently took 80 mg of osimertinib orally daily for 2 years, with regular follow-ups during this period, achieving a clinical complete remission (cCR). A chest CT review in April 2023 showed an enlarged tumor with a maximum diameter of 21 mm, and efficacy was assessed as progressive disease (PD) according to RECIST criteria. A repeat genetic test indicated the EGFR exon 21 L858R mutation with an abundance of 23.25%. A follow-up chest CT in February 2024 showed that the patientâ€™s tumor had enlarged compared to the previous scan, with a maximum diameter of 29 mm. The efficacy assessment was recorded as PD. The June 2024 CT scan showed an increase in the size of the lung tumor compared to the February 2024 scan, with a maximum diameter of 37 mm. The efficacy assessment was recorded as PD.
