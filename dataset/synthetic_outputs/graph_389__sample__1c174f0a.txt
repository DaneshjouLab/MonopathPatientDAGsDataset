A 73-year-old female was admitted to Hubin Community Health Service Center in March 2024 with recurrent fever, cough, and white sputum for greater than one month. A non-contrast chest CT indicated a solid lesion of the lower lobe of the left lung with an endobronchial nodule, prompting the need for a contrast-enhanced chest CT scan. Subsequently, the patient was admitted to The Second Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University. The patient reported good mental status and diet, no abdominal pain, diarrhea, chest tightness, asthma, chills, and no significant change in weight. She reported occasional coughs with white phlegm. Her medical history included elevated triglycerides, but no history of smoking, drinking, hypertension, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, or glucose intolerance, and she denied any history of infection. A follow-up non-contrast chest CT showed a solid lesion of the lower lobe of the left lung with an endobronchial nodule and spot-like calcification in the endobronchial nodule. Physical examination revealed a body mass index of 23.1 kg/m2 and a temperature of 36.5Â°C.
