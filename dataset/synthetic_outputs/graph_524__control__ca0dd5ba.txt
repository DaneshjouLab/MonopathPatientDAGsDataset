After further investigations, the patient was diagnosed with a small-cell lung carcinoma of the right lung with pleural and lymph node metastasis. Disease evaluation after 6 weeks of atezolizumab in monotherapy already showed progressive disease. Evaluation after two cycles of oral topotecan showed a stable disease without disease regression as shown in Figure 1a and b. Initiation of the second cycle had to be postponed for 1 week due to (asymptomatic) neutropenia. Disease evaluation after a switch to IV topotecan showed significant disease regression with remarkable volume decrease of the primary tumoral mass, pleural lesions, and lymph nodes, whereas after the first 2 cycles of oral topotecan no change was seen at all as shown in Figure 1c. The patient received a total of 8 cycles of IV topotecan after which he developed disease progression again after 3 months of response (cfr. timeline; Fig. 2). Tolerance to IV topotecan was relatively good, with little subjective side effects and mainly hematological adverse effects such as neutropenia and anemia for which growth factors and transfusions became necessary. This to our knowledge is the first reported case of better response to IV administration of topotecan than to oral administration in a patient with an extensive stage small-cell lung carcinoma with pleural metastasis and lymph node invasion.
