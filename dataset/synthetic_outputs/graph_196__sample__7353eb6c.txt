An 83-year-old Japanese woman with no smoking history, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia was referred to the hospital for evaluation of a right pleural effusion observed on chest radiography. The patient was independent in her daily lifestyle activities. CT chest revealed a tumor in the right lower lung lobe, enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, and right pleural effusion. Based on pleural effusion cytology, she was diagnosed with Stage IVA (clinical T3N2M1a) lung adenocarcinoma. Liver metastasis was ruled out, and she had no hepatitis B or C viral infection.

From initial diagnosis, the patient underwent pleurosclerosis due to persistent pleural effusion. Selpercatinib administration was initiated. Image findings indicated a hepatic disorder.

Following initial visit and selpercatinib administration, a driver mutation test was performed using a pleural effusion cell block, revealing RET fusion. Selpercatinib dosage was 320mg/day. Initial lab values were AST 23 U/L (Upper limit of normal, 30 U/L), ALT 17 U/L (Upper limit of normal, 23 U/L), ALP 125 U/L (Upper limit of normal, 113 U/L), and γ-GTP 51 U/L (upper limit of normal, 32 U/L).

Following selpercatinib initiation and RET fusion detection, the patient's Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status was 1. On Day 17, the patient developed a fever.
