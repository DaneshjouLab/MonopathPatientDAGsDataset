A 72-year-old male presented with progressive dysphagia, retrosternal pain, intermittent cough, and significant weight loss over two years, worsening in the last month. These symptoms led to a chest CT on July 4, 2022, which revealed a right upper lung mass and right pleural effusion. Imaging findings prompted a right pleural puncture, and pathological analysis confirmed lung adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemical staining showed positive expression of cytokeratin (CK) 7, carcinoembryonic antigen, and thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1). Further molecular testing via next-generation sequencing detected PIK3CA mutations. Endoscopy reports from a local hospital led to a suspected diagnosis of jackhammer esophagus, based on an esophageal high-resolution manometry report, low resting pressure of the upper esophagus sphincter, normal pressure of the lower esophagus sphincter, and locally increased pressure in the middle and lower esophagus without normal peristalsis (Chicago classification II and III).

The patient had been suffering from hypertension for several years. Mild tenderness in the right chest was identified by palpation. Lab tests revealed a carcinoembryonic antigen level of 5.42 ng/mL and a neuron-specific enolase level of 19.22 ng/mL. An esophagogram revealed grade I dilation of the esophageal lumen, segmental stenosis of the distal esophagus, and delayed emptying of barium contrast agent from the esophagus. Endoscopy revealed a 2 cm long segment of concentric esophageal stenosis 35â€“37 cm away from the incisors, with apparently normal overlying mucosa. The cardia had normal contraction and relaxation. Serum albumin level changed from below 40 g/L pre-POEM to above 40 g/L post-POEM.

CT imaging revealed abnormality of the right 9th and 10th ribs and enlargement of mediastinal lymph nodes. Thickening of the wall in the lower esophagus far from the lung space-occupying lesion was also observed. The patient was diagnosed with right upper lung adenocarcinoma with multiple rib and mediastinal lymph node metastases and right malignant pleural effusion, clinically staged as cT1bN0M1c, IVB. Post-POEM diagnosis confirmed esophageal muscle metastasis arising from lung adenocarcinoma. An individualized POEM procedure was performed on July 14, 2022, to alleviate dysphagia before chemotherapy. Submucosal injection was performed at the level of the middle esophagus, 5 cm proximal to the level of stenosis. A longitudinal tunnel was created until the level of the stenosis was reached. Inner circular myotomy of the esophagus was performed to expand the tunnel space, beginning 3 cm distal to the mucosal entry.
