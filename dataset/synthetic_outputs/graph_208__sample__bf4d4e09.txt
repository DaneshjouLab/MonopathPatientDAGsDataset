A 58-year-old Chinese female (G4P3) presented in March 2021 with cough and chest pain. Diagnostic workup revealed lung cancer with multiple metastases to the cervical lymph nodes, brain, and bone (Fig.1). On March 15, 2021, she was administered chemotherapy intravenously with pemetrexed and carboplatin, along with bevacizummab. On April 11, 2021, her treatment regimen was adjusted to dacomitinib (oral, once daily) based on genetic testing results.

On April 29, 2022, she was admitted to the hospital due to lumbosacral pain and discomfort, accompanied by slight numbness in the left lower limb. She had a history of hypertension but no history of smoking, drinking, or morphine use.

Upon admission, her weight was 60 kg, height 165 cm, temperature 36.6 \u2103, blood pressure 122/76 mmHg, respiratory rate 20 breaths/minute, and pulse rate 80 beats/minute. Physical examination showed lumbosacral tenderness. Neurological examination including mental state was normal. Lumbosacral soreness was assessed with a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) score of 2.

Computed tomography showed a right lung mass. Lumbar radiation therapy was initiated on the day of admission.

By Day 9 of hospitalization, radiotherapy had reduced her pain and stabilized her NRS score at 1. She reported increased stool frequency without abdominal pain, fever, or other discomforts. Her procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were normal, and routine urine and stool analyses indicated no clinical abnormalities. She was treated with montmorillonite powder, dexamethasone, and vitamin B12 for radiation enteritis.

By Day 15, symptoms of radiation enteritis had worsened. She experienced breakthrough pain with an NRS score of 5 at 8:58, and a tramadol 100 mg injection was administered. She then developed abdominal pain with an NRS score of 3, followed by renewed abdominal pain with an NRS score of 8 at 13:36, for which she was treated with a morphine 10 mg injection. Morphine relieved her pain and stabilized her NRS score at 2 after about half an hour.

On Day 15 at 12:25, she developed nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. Her body temperature increased to 38.0 \u2103 by 18:00, and was cooled down by physical cooling.

On Day 16 at 00:29, she was treated with a morphine 10 mg injection for abdominal pain with an NRS score of 6, which relieved her pain and stabilized her NRS score at 2. She suffered a fever again by 5:00 with a body temperature of 39.2 \u2103. Her pulse rate increased to 100 beats/minute during the fever period.
