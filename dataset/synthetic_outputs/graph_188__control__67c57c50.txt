A case of retinal metastasis from small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) is reported. The presentation mimicked cytomegalovirus retinitis.

A 48-year-old woman presented with a 4-week history of a visual field loss in her right eye. She had a medical history of extensive-stage SCLC with brain metastasis, stable on maintenance atezolizumab for 2 years. On initial presentation, she was diagnosed with cytomegalovirus retinitis. No improvement was observed with 4 weeks of oral valganciclovir. Upon referral for a second opinion, her fundus examination appeared compatible with cytomegalovirus retinitis, and anterior chamber tap for polymerase chain reaction for viral etiologies was performed followed by intravitreal and IV ganciclovir without improvement. She was referred for a third opinion, where diagnostic vitrectomy with vitreous and retinal biopsies were consistent with SCLC metastatic to the retina.

Intense antiviral treatment was initially administered without improvement. Vitrectomy and retinal biopsy revealed metastatic retinal involvement. Enucleation of the right eye was performed for definitive pathologic analysis, and additional systemic chemotherapy was initiated.

Retinal metastasis should be considered in patients initially diagnosed with viral retinitis who fail to improve despite antiviral therapy, particularly if they have a known history of malignancy. Furthermore, retinal metastasis of SCLC potentially could be misdiagnosed histopathologically as retinoblastoma if the patient's history is unknown and appropriate immunohistochemical stains are not performed.
