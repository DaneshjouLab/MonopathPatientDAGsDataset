A 59-year-old male farmer with a history of hypertension and long-term smoking presented with redness and pain in the second toe of his right foot following a field injury, persisting for two weeks. One week later, the patient developed redness and persistent pain in the left lumbar and groin areas, which was accompanied by coughing, expectoration, and a fever peaking at 38 °C. The patient was admitted to a local hospital. Initial blood tests and a chest CT scan suggested the possibility of a bacterial infection (Table1). The patient was treated with piperacillin-tazobactam (4.5 g q8 h) for a week with no improvement. The patient was then transferred to the hospital with the following vital signs: body temperature 39.1 °C, heart rate 136 bpm, respiratory rate 36 breaths/minute, blood pressure 140/75 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 85%. The patient was stuporous, responsive to vocal stimuli yet unable to answer questions, with bilateral pupils which were equal, round, and reactive to light. Irregular heartbeat and coarse breath sounds in both lungs (no rales) were noted. HIV, AIGA, blood G test, GM test, and blood cultures were negative. Chest/brain CT scans were performed (Table1 and Fig.2(a, d)). Serial sputum cultures were conducted over three consecutive days; the initial specimen was inadequate (WBC < 10/LPF, epithelial cells 201/LPF). Subsequent sputum specimens exhibited cellular profiles consistent with lower respiratory origin (WBC 35–50/LPF, epithelial cells 5–8/LPF), with persistent isolation of Burkholderia cepacia (2/2 cultures). In week 3, the patient experienced cough, expectoration, fever, left lumbar/groin erythema/pain. White blood cell count (×10⁹/L) was 15.41, Neutrophil count (×10⁹/L) was 6.3, Neutrophil percentage was 92.6, Albumin(g/L) was 29, C-reactive protein(μmol/L) was 90.8, Procalcitonin(ng/mL) was 3.05, N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide(pg/mL) was 10675, Alanine aminotransferase(U/L) was 11, Aspartate aminotransferase(U/L) was 16, and Creatinine(μmol/L) was 295.5. By week 4, the patient experienced stupor and hypoxia (SpO₂ 85%). Cardiac examination revealed atrial fibrillation. White blood cell count (×10⁹/L) was 10.01, Neutrophil count (×10⁹/L) was 10.08, Neutrophil percentage was 92.8, Albumin(g/L) was 22.8, C-reactive protein(μmol/L) was 176.8, and Procalcitonin(ng/mL) was 30.58. An electrocardiogram indicated atrial fibrillation. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing indicated sensitivity to meropenem (MIC 4 μg/mL).
