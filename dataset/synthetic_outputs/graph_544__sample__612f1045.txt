A 58-year-old woman presented with a 3-month history of cough. The patient underwent thin-slice chest CT, which revealed multiple nodules scattered in both lungs. The largest ground glass opacity (GGO) was located in the anterior segment of the right upper lobe, measuring approximately 11*9 mm. The largest nodule was clinically diagnosed as early-stage lung cancer, and thoracoscopic segmentectomy was scheduled. The patient underwent general anesthesia induced with double-lumen intubation in preparation for thoracoscopic segmentectomy. Aerosolized ICG (3.75 mg/ml) was inhaled into the operative lung after single-lung ventilation. Ventilator settings were: volume-controlled mode, tidal volume 450-500 ml, 12 respirations per minute, inspiratory-to-expiratory ratio 1:2. ICG inhalation lasted 5 min. Fluorescence imaging of the lung tissue was not obvious during surgery. The horizontal fissure and the vein in the anterior segment were dissected and cut with endoscopic staplers (EndoGIA). Under the overlay imaging window of the NIF imaging system, the bronchus was shown in green, indicating that the bronchi contrasted with the surrounding lung tissue.
