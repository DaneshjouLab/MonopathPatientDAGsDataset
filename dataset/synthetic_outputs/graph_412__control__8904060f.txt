A 65-year-old female patient was diagnosed with stage IV non-small-cell lung adenocarcinoma with synchronic brain metastasis in February 2015. Before and during treatment, 416 tumor-related genes were monitored dynamically by liquid biopsies using next-generation sequencing, and the treatment strategy was decided according to the gene status. At baseline, an EGFR L858R mutation in exon 21 was detected, so treatment with icotinib was started. After 8 months, she experienced disease progression with leptomeningeal metastasis and switched to osimertinib based on an acquired EGFR T790M mutation. After 9 months, her disease progressed and an EGFR L718Q mutation was found in the cerebrospinal fluid. The patient was then challenged with afatinib, and her disease was under control for 4 months. In January 2017, the patient passed away, with an overall survival time of 23 months, 15 months after leptomeningeal metastasis.
