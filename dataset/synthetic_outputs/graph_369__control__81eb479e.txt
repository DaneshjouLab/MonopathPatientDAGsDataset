A clinical case report focuses on acquired resistance to PD-1 blockade in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). PD-1 blockade is now a routine treatment for nearly all patients with NSCLC. Acquired resistance to PD-1 blockade is defined as an initial response to the treatment followed later by disease progression. This phenomenon is common but poorly understood. The case report highlights the lack of standard guidance for clinical management when acquired resistance is suspected. The infrequency of tumor biopsies and the uncertainty of actionability from tissue sampling contribute to limited insight into the biology of acquired resistance. To address this knowledge gap and to highlight the value of tumor and liquid biopsy, the report presents a representative case of suspected acquired resistance to PD-1 blockade and proposes a multi-modal guide for approaching this clinical scenario.
