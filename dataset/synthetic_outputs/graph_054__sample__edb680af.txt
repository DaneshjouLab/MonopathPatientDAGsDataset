A 49-year-old male, a heavy smoker with a 37 pack-year history, was admitted to a local hospital with acute abdominal pain. He had no prior history of chronic diseases. An enhanced CT scan revealed a 4.0 cm soft tissue mass within the lumen of the small intestine and mid-lower intestine intussusception. The CT scan also showed a well-defined soft tissue mass in the lumen of the ileum.

The patient was admitted to the general surgery ward and underwent intussusception surgery on April 8, 2019. During surgery, an irregular, hard, solid white mass involving the intestine was identified. A complete resection of the mass with a partial small intestine resection was performed.

The resected specimen was a multinodular mass with a tan-white cut surface and firm consistency, with a thin envelope observed in the periphery of the mass. Histological examination revealed a tumor located within the submucosa and lamina propria of the intestinal wall with mucosal erosion. Neoplastic cells were embedded within an inflammatory background. The initial diagnosis was ALK-positive inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT), highly suspicious for epithelioid inflammatory myofibroblastic sarcoma (EIMS). Immunohistochemistry showed ALK(5A4) positivity in the neoplastic cells.

Further pathology revealed neoplastic components of fat spindle-shaped cells and large epithelioid cells with ovoid nuclei interwoven with each other distributed in the background of many neutrophil cells. Mitotic activity was frequent, up to 10 per 10 high-power fields.
