A 13-year-old female dog presented with dyspnea and lethargy. Thoracic X-ray revealed a large, bulging heart, suggesting pericardial effusion. Ultrasound examination showed a high amount of fluid between the heart and pericardium. Pericardiocentesis was performed, resulting in 220 ml of bloody fluid. Analysis of the pericardial fluid was inconclusive. Fifteen days later, the dog returned to the hospital with the same ailment. 440 ml of bleeding pericardial effusion was drained. Analysis of the fluid was suggestive of neoplasia. On day 23, the dog returned and was referred to the hospitalâ€™s video-surgery department, where a new pericardiocentesis was performed, resulting in 295 ml drained. On day 27, thoracoscopic pericardiectomy was performed via intercostal and paraxiphoid accesses. Pleural biopsies were also taken. The patient was maintained in a dorsal decubitus inclined to the right. The first portal was placed through the 8th left intercostal space, followed by the paraxiphoid portal. A third intercostal access was performed on the left side. Pleural biopsies were collected from areas with macroscopic proliferation. Partial pericardectomy was performed, removing an extensive pericardial segment.
