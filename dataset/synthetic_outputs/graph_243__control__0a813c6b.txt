A patient with adult glioma, specifically glioblastoma, astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, mesiotemporal angiocentric glioma, or ependymoma, was diagnosed and underwent cancer-specific treatment. The patient also had a history of obesity, tobacco use, and diabetes. Subsequently, the patient contracted SARS-CoV-2 infection, developing COVID-19 with symptoms including cough, sore throat, and congestion. Dexamethasone was administered. The patient ultimately succumbed to COVID-related causes, resulting in COVID-related death. The patient's underlying glioma and the COVID-19 infection, complicated by hematologic and pulmonary malignancies, contributed to the fatal outcome.
