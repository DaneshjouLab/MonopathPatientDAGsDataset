A case report describes a patient with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), specifically stage IV. NSCLC is a common form of lung cancer and a leading cause of death worldwide. The patient's disease progressed on 4 cycles of alimta, carboplatin, and keytruda, and was PD-1 (+) 25%. The case suggests that a treatment regimen involving a combination of autologous immunotherapy and bevacizumab may be a potential approach for advanced NSCLC with PD-L1 expression. Bevacizumab is approved for the treatment of several cancers, including metastatic non-squamous NSCLC, and is often combined with chemotherapy as a first-line and maintenance treatment in advanced NSCLC. Studies have also explored bevacizumab in association with new molecular therapies or immunotherapy for maintenance treatment or disease progression. Studies have shown that the combination of bevacizumab and chemotherapy increased overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) more than the group receiving chemotherapy alone in NSCLC patients. Moreover, a combination of bevacizumab and atezolizumab was indicated to have a promising antitumor activity with good tolerability for patients with metastatic NSCLC whose disease had progressed after atezolizumab monotherapy. Studies have also explored advanced NSCLC patients with PD-L1 (+) given pembrolizumab.
