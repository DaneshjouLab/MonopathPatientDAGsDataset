A 35-year-old man with a history of smoking approximately 1 pack of cigarettes per day for 15 years presented with pulmonary nodules found during a routine health assessment 2 years prior. The nodules had progressively enlarged with follow-up. Further investigation with a CT scan revealed a 4.6 cm × 2.8 cm soft tissue mass in the left inferior lobe with obstructive changes. A subsequent PET-CT scan indicated high 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in the left inferior lobe mass. Further imaging revealed a mass (4.94 cm × 3.47 cm; SUV, 13.8) in the left hilar (stations 4L) and mediastinal lymph nodes (stations 7 and 8), suggesting malignant disease and lymph node metastasis with no signs of distant metastasis. Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial lung biopsy (EBUS-TBLB) of the left lung mass showed adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemistry revealed positive staining for Napsin A, cytokeratin (CK), thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), and ALK. Next-generation sequencing identified an EML4-ALK fusion. The diagnosis was clinical stage IIIA [8th American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC): cT2bN2M0] pulmonary adenocarcinoma with left hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes metastasis. Treatment was initiated with neoadjuvant lorlatinib (100 mg daily) administered from March 7, 2023, to June 28, 2023.
