A 72-year-old man with no smoking history underwent a right upper lobectomy for adenosquamous carcinoma. Preoperative fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-CT scan showed no metastasis. Resected specimen showed adenosquamous carcinoma measuring 6.5 cm x 4 cm x 3.5 cm with visceral pleural invasion and lymphovascular permeation. Surgical margins were clear and the resected intrathoracic lymph nodes were free of metastasis (pathological stage IIB [pT3N0M0]). Adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin 75 mg/m2 on day 1 and vinorelbine 25 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 every three weeks for four cycles was administered. Repeat CT examination eight months post-surgery showed a recurrent tumor at the apex of the remaining right lung measuring 7.0 cm x 6.6 cm x 3.7 cm. Surgical resection of the recurrent tumor and reconstruction of the chest wall was performed. Histopathological examination revealed a high grade pleomorphic sarcoma with no epithelial elements. Tumor cells were strongly positive for vimentin and negative for cytokeratin (CK) 5 and 6, and thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1). Malignant glandular component made up of dysplastic cells arranged in distinct confluent glandular-cribriform clusters.
