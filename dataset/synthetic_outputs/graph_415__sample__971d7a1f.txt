A 50-year-old Japanese woman with a history of Hodgkin's lymphoma, treated at age 25 with mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisolone chemotherapy and radiation therapy to the mediastinum (50 Gray/25 fractions) and abdomen (56 Gray/28 fractions), developed a small amount of left pleural effusion five years after radiation therapy. The pleural effusion was too small to perform thoracentesis, and the patient was monitored with chest CT and X-ray, with radiation pleuritis considered as a possible cause. After 20 years of follow-up, the pleural effusion and thickness increased. The patient visited the hospital for an evaluation, and no pleural calcifications were noted. Positron emission tomography revealed 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in the thickening pleura. A full-thickness pleural biopsy showed tubule-papillary components in the pleura. Immunohistochemistry showed positive staining for calretinin, D2-40, and CK5/6 and negative staining for CEA and p40, leading to a diagnosis of epithelial type of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). A chest contrast-enhanced CT a year before the first visit to the hospital revealed a small amount of pleural effusion. FDG-PET a year before the first visit to the hospital revealed no FDG uptake. No asbestos bodies were found. FDG-PET at the first visit to the hospital revealed an FDG uptake in the left pleural cavity. Pathological findings of a full-thickness pleural biopsy specimen revealed epithelioid-type MPM. IHC showed positive staining for calretinin, D2-40, and CK5/6 and negative staining for CEA and p40. Chemotherapy with carboplatin and pemetrexed was administered, and maintenance therapy with pemetrexed is currently ongoing.
