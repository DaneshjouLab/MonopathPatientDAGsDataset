A patient with advanced melanoma was treated with pembrolizumab. Subsequently, the patient developed multiple organ failure due to Catastrophic Antiphospholipid Syndrome (CAPS). Testing revealed the presence of anti-cardiolipin (aCL) antibodies: aCL IgM 26 MPL/mL and aCL IgA 60 APL/mL. Lupus anticoagulant (LAC), aCL IgG, and autoantibodies to B2-glycoprotein 1 were negative. Previous test results of antinuclear antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies, and antibodies to double-stranded DNA were negative. Complement C3 and C4 levels were normal. Blood and sputum cultures were also negative.
