A 66-year-old woman was diagnosed with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the right lung (T2N0M1c) with ipsilateral pleural and diffuse bone spread. Initial treatment with carboplatin/pemetrexed chemotherapy resulted in a partial remission after two cycles, followed by pemetrexed maintenance. During this time, ALK rearrangement was detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). RNA next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the tumor identified transcripts of KLC1exon 9 fused with ALKexon 20 (K9–A20). ctDNA analysis from longitudinal blood plasma samples confirmed KLC1-ALK translocation with breakpoints in KLC1 intron 9 and ALK intron 19. A plasma sample during partial remission (after 2 cycles carboplatin/pemetrexed) showed ALK fusion variant allele frequency (VAF) of 0.09% and no ALK SNVs. Serum sample showed CEA 39.52 ng/µL and CYFRA 21-1 0.53 ng/µL. Two months after pemetrexed maintenance, chest CT showed progression of the primary tumor and pleural effusion. Brain MRI detected new cerebral metastases. The KLC1–ALK fusion VAF rose to 6.25%. Tumor protein markers CEA and CYFRA 21–1 also increased. Second-line treatment with crizotinib (250 mg twice daily) was initiated, resulting in tumor shrinkage of approximately 40% as determined by radiological imaging. Retrospective analysis showed a fusion VAF of 4.4%. ctDNA analysis identified four distinct secondary mutations in the kinase domain of the ALK gene: ALKp.F1174C, ALKp. F1174L, ALKp.G1269A. Whole-brain radiotherapy with 30 Gy (10 fractions of 3 Gy) was administered.
