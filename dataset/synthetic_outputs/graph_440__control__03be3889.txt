A 72-year-old never-smoker male patient with a known history of diabetes mellitus was diagnosed in July 2012 with KRAS.pG12D-positive T1N0M0 adenocarcinoma of the ascending colon and cecum. The patient underwent right hemicolectomy with an end-to-end anastomosis and received oral chemotherapy with Capecitabine (500 mg, Once Daily (OD)) for 4 months. In October 2014, a follow-up 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scan detected a hypermetabolic nodular lesion with spiculated margins in the anterior segment of the upper lobe of the left lung, suspected of metastasis from the primary colon cancer. The patient received oral chemotherapy with Capecitabine (500 mg, OD) for 2 months. In October 2015, radiological follow-up (chest X-ray) indicated persistent and increased size of the lesion in the anterior segment of the left upper lobe of the lung, indicating non-response to Capecitabine. The patient was later diagnosed with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and Stage IV Refractory NSCLC. The case report describes long-term therapy management based on iterative de novo molecular and cellular analysis. Temporal tumor evolution, emergent therapy resistance, and disease recurrences were addressed via the administration of personalized label- and organ-agnostic treatments based on de novo tumor profiling. This adaptive and iterative treatment strategy countered disease progression at each instance and led to the durable regression of primary as well as metastatic lesions. Concurrently, serial evaluation of mutations in cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) via liquid biopsy (LBx) was performed to monitor disease status, ascertain treatment response, identify emergent drug resistance, and detect recurrence at sub-radiological levels.
