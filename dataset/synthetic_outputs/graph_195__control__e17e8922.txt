A patient with a history of a purulent fluid drainage via the IPC presented with chest pain and inspiratory crackles at the right lower lung zone on lung auscultation. The patient experienced recurrent effusions and associated pleural infections requiring repeat chest drains in the area of the postoperative hydropneumothorax. An acute stroke was suspected when the patient had a witnessed sudden drop in conscious level with associated seizure like activity. CT head revealed multiple serpiginous pockets of air along the cerebral fissure, with features that were highly suggestive of a cerebral air embolism and multiple wedge-shaped areas of infarction involving the cerebral hemispheres. General examination did not demonstrate any peripheral stigmata of systemic air embolism and no retinal air bubbles were seen in funduscopic examination. The cause of the cerebral air embolism (CAE) was not clear as there were no immediate complications at the time of the IPC procedure and subsequent radiology confirmed satisfactory position of the IPC with no trauma to the lung or any major blood vessels but it is likely that he had a pulmonary venous air embolism. The patient's condition slowly deteriorated and his GCS was not improved. However, his condition deteriorated and he died later.
