A 60-year-old male with a history of completed open pulmonary TB treatment 30 years ago presented with fever, productive cough, and left-sided pleuritic chest pain over 2 weeks. He is a nonsmoker. Past medical history was otherwise unremarkable and was completely asymptomatic up to this presentation. Respiratory rate was 16/min. Reduced left-sided chest expansion and prominent left apical flattening were noted.

The patient's condition progressed to include tracheal shift to the left. Auscultation revealed reduced air entry with a dull percussion noted on the left lower zone. Chest radiograph showed a loss of lung volume on the left side with a mediastinal shift, large cavities in the left upper and middle zones with an opacity at the left upper zone, and left-sided moderate effusion.

Sputum culture was positive for Klebsiella, and the patient was treated for Klebsiella pneumonia. Sputum was negative for acid fast bacilli and culture negative for TB. Contrast-enhanced CT scan revealed a completely destroyed left lung with multiple air- and fluid-filled cavities and fibrotic bands.

The CT scan also revealed an enhancing lesion at the apicoposterior segment of the left upper lobe measuring 6.8 \u00d7 4.8 \u00d7 3.8\u2009cm with marginally enlarged lymph nodes in the aortopulmonary window. Right lung fields were expanded with a mediastinal shift.

Fibrooptic bronchoscopy excluded a major bronchial involvement of the lesion.

Ultrasound guided biopsy was suggestive of a malignancy with a squamous cell variant.

The patient underwent a left posterolateral thoracotomy. Operative findings mirrored the CT findings, revealing a peripherally located tumor confined to the left upper lobe. The left lung was destroyed, cavitatory, and small due to previous tuberculosis. An empyema with a large cavity around the lower lobe was noted.

Pus culture was negative for TB. Several mediastinal lymph nodes on the aortopulmonary window were enlarged and were resected. The hilar vessels and the left main bronchus were divided separately using endostaplers, and the left lung was removed en bloc.

The patient received postoperative intensive care and recovered without complications.

The patient was discharged on postoperative day 5 on pulmonary rehabilitation.

Histology revealed a moderately differentiated keratinizing-type squamous cell carcinoma with a maximum diameter of 7.5 cm (T4) and visceral pleural invasion (PL1). Bronchial resection margin was free of tumor with a 10 mm clearance (pT4N0Mx). All 16 lymph nodes were free of tumor.

Post surgical lung function at 1 month showed satisfactory improvement with good functional capacity. The patient was referred to an oncologist for adjuvant therapy.
