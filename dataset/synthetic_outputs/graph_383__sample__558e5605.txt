A 77-year-old man presented with metastatic intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). Six months prior to presentation, the patient was diagnosed with a 6-cm right liver mass and underwent surgical resection. Pathology revealed cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) with sarcomatoid features (stage T1bN0M0). Relevant past medical history included use of rosuvastatin at 40 mg PO QD. Genomic testing (Foundation One CDx) revealed a BRAF exon 15 p.V600E mutation along with CDKN2a loss, CDKN2b loss, PIK3CA H1047R, CDKN1A R48*, and PIM1 amplification. Patient received adjuvant capecitabine, but it was discontinued after three cycles due to a drug-related rash. Restaging positron emission tomographyâ€“computed tomography revealed a 1.2-cm left upper lobe nodule. Biopsy confirmed metastatic disease. Patient transitioned to gemcitabine, cisplatin, and abraxane and received five cycles, with a best response of progressive disease. Patient enrolled in the TAPUR trial based on his BRAF exon 15 p.V600E mutation and started on vemurafenib (960 mg PO twice daily [BID]) and cobimetinib (60 mg PO once daily [QD], 21 days on, 7 days off).
