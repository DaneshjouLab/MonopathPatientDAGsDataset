A 51-year-old woman visited the hospital with a chief complaint of an abnormal chest shadow in the right lung, detected during a routine annual check-up. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed a 14-mm ground-glass opacity in the right upper lobe, suspicious for lung cancer. The CT scan also revealed a tracheal bronchus originating directly from the trachea, and a pulmonary vein variation running dorsal to the pulmonary artery. The patient was scheduled for right apical segmentectomy with mediastinal lymph node sampling for suspected adenocarcinoma. She underwent thoracoscopic apical segmentectomy and mediastinal lymph node sampling. The pathological diagnosis was minimally invasive adenocarcinoma with negative margins and no evidence of lymph node metastasis. Her postoperative course was uneventful, and she was discharged 5 days post-operation. No problems were observed 13 months after surgery.
