In 2016, a patient presented with advanced adenocarcinoma staged cT4 cN2 cM1a (contralateral lung segment 10), harbouring an EML4-ALK rearrangement. After two courses of chemotherapy, the patient started second-line therapy with crizotinib, leading to complete remission within 6 months. Ten months after the start of crizotinib, a tumorous formation on the right kidney was detected. Surgical resection showed an aseptic abscess. One year later, the patient presented with fatigue, inappetence, intermittent sweating, and diffuse abdominal pain. Computed tomography revealed two large abscesses with typical rim enhancement in the left-sided thoracic wall (measuring 7.2 × 3.6 × 1.9 cm), left liver lobe (9.6 × 7.7 × 4.5 cm), and several others in the left kidney, right liver lobe, and the interenteric space. A computed tomography scan after 2 years of treatment with crizotinib showed abscess formations in the liver, the thoracic wall, and kidney. Laboratory evaluation demonstrated normal WBC count, elevated CRP (140 mg/l) and slightly elevated PCT (0.8 ng/ml) as well as increased liver function tests (below twice the ULN). Repeated blood cultures were negative. Percutaneous ultrasound-guided drainage of the abscesses at the left kidney and the liver was performed, yielding blood-stained serous fluid, cytologically described as abscess without tumor cells. Microbiological culture as well as screening for extrapulmonary tuberculosis or atypical mycobacteriosis including Ziehl–Neelsen staining and PCR was negative. Endoscopic examination of the colon and transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography showed no source of infection. Intravenous treatment with piperacillin/tazobactam was ineffective. Crizotinib was discontinued, leading to rapid improvement of the patient's overall condition and symptoms. CRP and liver function tests normalized.
