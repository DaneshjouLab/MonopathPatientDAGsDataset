A patient, 41% male and 59% female, underwent a contrast-enhanced CT scan. The indications for the CT scan included suspicion of breast cancer (11%), colon cancer (10%), and lung cancer or nodules (10%). The body regions scanned were the abdomen (73%) and thorax (62%). Static imaging was performed. In preparation for the CT imaging, the patient underwent intravenous contrast injection. The injection site was the left antecubital vein in 40% of cases and the right antecubital vein in 60% of cases. The contrast volume ranged from 90-130 mL, with a mean of 119.5 mL. The injection rate ranged from 2.8-4.5 mL/s, with a mean of 3.6 mL/s. A saline flush of 20-30 mL was administered.
