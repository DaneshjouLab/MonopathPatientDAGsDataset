We encountered a case of interleukin‐5 (IL‐5)‐producing malignant pleural mesothelioma with eosinophilic pleural effusion. There have been few reports of IL‐5‐producing tumors, and this is the first report of IL‐5‐producing malignant pleural mesothelioma.

The patient was diagnosed with malignant pleural mesothelioma by pleural biopsy, with eosinophilic pleural effusion. IL‐5 in the pleural effusion increased, and tumor cells were IL‐5‐positive by immunostaining. Host‐tumor cell interactions cause eosinophilic pleural effusion. In patients with eosinophilic pleural effusion, malignant pleural effusion should be considered. It is necessary to clarify the pathophysiology of malignant tumors and eosinophils.

Malignant pleural mesothelioma was suspected. Thus, using cell blocks prepared from the pleural effusion, p16 homozygous deletion was confirmed by p16 fluorescence in situ hybridization because 45% of the tumor cells showed loss of both p16 gene signals. Thoracoscopic biopsy of parietal pleura confirmed the diagnosis because of the tumor invasion to the pleura and adipose tissue. Biphasic malignant pleural mesothelioma with 70% epithelioid cells and 30% sarcomatoid cells was diagnosed. After examination, including 18‐fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG‐PET/CT), the patient was clinically diagnosed with malignant pleural mesothelioma cT3N2M0 stage III.

Immunostaining of the tumor tissue showed positive staining for IL‐5. Thus, IL‐5 production from malignant pleural mesothelioma cells was suggested.

The patient was diagnosed with biphasic malignant pleural mesothelioma. Chemotherapy (cisplatin and pemetrexed) was performed at monthly intervals for a total of three cycles. However, his condition progressed, and he was transferred to a hospice and died about a year later.
