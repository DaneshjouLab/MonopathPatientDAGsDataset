A 63-year-old woman with no notable medical history presented with a right lung tumor that had been progressively enlarging. She had no smoking history, no family history of cancer, and no remarkable physical findings. Initial chest CT revealed a 3.1cm right middle lobe tumor without calcification or pleural invasion, located in the proximal part of the right middle lobe. Further characterization of the tumor with imaging and lab tests showed that the tumor had enlarged over 10 years compared to a previous CT image. Blood serum levels of squamous cell carcinoma-related antigen and carcinoembryonic antigen were within the normal range. F-18 FDG PET-CT showed an accumulation of F-18 FDG in the tumor (maximum standardized uptake value, 3.17). Head contrast-enhanced MRI showed no lesions. Based on these findings and the patient's history, a differential diagnosis of primary lung cancer stage IB (cT2aN0M0) was made, noting a nodule in the right middle lobe found on a chest CT scan taken 10 years prior. The patient underwent a right middle lobectomy via an anterolateral thoracotomy. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 7. Macroscopic findings of the resected tumor showed a well-defined tumor with a maximum diameter of 3 cm. Microscopic findings of the resected tumor showed proliferation of heteromorphic cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and analogous round nuclei. Immunohistochemistry revealed the tumor was positive for vimentin, EMA, and PgR, and negative for chromogranin A, synaptophysin, and thyroid transcription factor-1. The Ki-67 index was < 3%. Based on these histological and immunohistochemical findings, the final diagnosis was revised to WHO grade I meningioma.
