A 70-year-old man presented with a soft tissue density mass in the right lower lung. Initial chest CT suggested lung cancer. However, subsequent pathological biopsy of lung tissues confirmed a diagnosis of pulmonary actinomycosis. Pulmonary actinomycosis is a rare chronic purulent granulomatous disease that can be easily misdiagnosed as lung cancer, tuberculosis, and other diseases. The patient responded well to antibiotic treatment. Early diagnosis, relying on histopathological evidence, was conducive to the patient's recovery.
