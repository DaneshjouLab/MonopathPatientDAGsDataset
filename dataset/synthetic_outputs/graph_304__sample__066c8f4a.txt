A 62-year-old male with a significant 50-year smoking history (50 pack-years), a prior duodenopancreatectomy for ampulloma in 2010, a BMI of 25 kg/m2, preserved general well being (OMS score = 0), and bilateral supraclavicular lymphadenopathies developed lung cancer in November 2019, which was revealed by hemoptysis.

Initial workup included a normal abdominal exam except for a midline laparotomy scar. Renal and hepatic function were normal. Complete blood count was normal: hemoglobin = 13 g/dl, white blood cells = 9700/l, platelets = 193,000/l. Chest x-ray revealed a spiculated opacity in the right lung.

Further imaging with a CT scan showed a 45-mm distal pulmonary mass with lymphatic extension and a left sub diaphragmatic peritoneal node consistent with peritoneal carcinosis. Bronchial endoscopy confirmed the presence of the tumor. Histological examination of lymphadenopathy concluded to a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with bronchopulmonary origin.

The tumor was staged T4N3M1, stage IV. Palliative chemotherapy based on gemcitabine-carboplatin was initiated.

One month post-chemotherapy, the patient presented with melena resulting in severe anemia (hemoglobin level 5 g/dl). Upper endoscopy revealed an ulcerated tumor on the pyloric antrum partially obturating the lumen.

Histological examination of the gastric tumor revealed cells expressing thyroid transcriptional factor-1.
