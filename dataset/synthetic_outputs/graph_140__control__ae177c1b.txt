We report the case of a patient with isolated lung IgG4-RD who relapsed under corticotherapy without the 2 main factors related to a higher risk of relapse: higher level of serum IgG4 and diffuse involvement. The patient experienced a relapse while receiving corticotherapy and subsequently underwent a left lower lobectomy. Pathological findings confirmed the diagnosis of IgG4-RD. After relapse under corticotherapy, he underwent a left lower lobectomy by a thoracotomy. The histopathological analysis revealed no malignancy and the presence of fibrotic areas, infiltration of IgG4+ plasma cells with 20 IgG4+/high-power field and obliterative phlebitis. The patient was diagnosed with IgG4-RD. After 2 months, the thoracic computerized tomography scan showed an important left pleural effusion that could be a consequence of the recent intervention or a relapse of IgG4-RD. After 2 months, the patient reported dyspnoea, and a thoracic CT scan showed a large-volume left pleural effusion (PE). Due to the uncertainty about the aetiology of the PE, the patient was submitted to video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery in order to drain the PE and to perform a pleural biopsy, the results of which were negative. The patient was discharged home and continued under steroid treatment for 6 months. One year after surgery, the patient was asymptomatic and without sign of relapse.
