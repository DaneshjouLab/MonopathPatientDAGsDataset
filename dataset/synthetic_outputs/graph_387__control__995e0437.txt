A patient presented with a constellation of symptoms including weight loss, anorexia, loss of appetite, tiredness, and a hoarse voice. Respiratory symptoms were also noted. Examination revealed skin lesions of the scalp, specifically cutaneous nodules. These nodules were described as firm, solitary, fast-growing, and mobile, with some progressing to ulcerant forms. Further investigation revealed a lung lesion, ultimately diagnosed as lung cancer, specifically pulmonary adenocarcinoma. The patient also exhibited a hot nodule in the right lung, right hilar involvement, left carotid jugular lymphadenopathy, and a left adrenal lesion. A pathological fracture in the right femoral collar was also identified. The scalp lesions were confirmed as scalp metastases from a primary visceral malignancy. Over time, the scalp metastases increased in number and extended. The patient also developed cutaneous nodule metastases and cutaneous metastases elsewhere. The scalp metastases presented as ulcerant cutaneous nodules.
