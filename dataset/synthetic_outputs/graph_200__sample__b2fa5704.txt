A 71-year-old man with a 40-pack-year smoking history presented with left chest pain. He was diagnosed with pulmonary adenocarcinoma in the left upper lobe, stage cT4N2M0 and IIIB. During the initial workup, thyroid nodules were detected on CT. PET-CT revealed strong uptake of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (SUVmax 15.33) in the lung tumor and slightly lower uptake (SUVmax 3.59) in the thyroid tumor. A biopsy of a thyroid sample did not reveal any malignant cells; however, the findings were indicative of a primary differentiated thyroid carcinoma or a benign thyroid tumor. The patient responded to first-line radiochemotherapy. Progression to pulmonary metastasis was noted 10 months after the diagnosis. Nivolumab was started as second-line therapy. After 12 cycles of nivolumab, CT revealed complete response of the pulmonary metastasis to treatment. After 32 cycles of nivolumab, the patient developed pain in the left neck. CT revealed rapid growth of the thyroid tumor with tracheal deviation and left cervical lymphadenopathy. Biopsies of the thyroid tumor and left cervical lymph node were performed. Histological examination suggested that the thyroid tumor and left cervical lymph nodes were composed of poorly differentiated tumor cells with milder nucleolar pleomorphy and hypertrophy compared with the previously biopsied lung tumor tissue. Immunohistochemical staining showed that the thyroid tumor cells were partially positive for cytokeratin (CK) and strongly positive for vimentin.
