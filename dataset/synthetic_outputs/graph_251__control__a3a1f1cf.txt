A 52-year-old female was diagnosed with bone metastatic EGFR L858R-mutated NSCLC. She was treated with osimertinib as second-line treatment for a leptomeningeal progression. After seventeen months of treatment, she developed an acquired EGFR L718V/TP53 V272M resistance co-mutation. Discordant molecular status was observed between plasmatic (L718V+/TP53+/L858R+) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (L718Vâˆ’/TP53+/L858R+). Afatinib as third line did not prevent neurological progression. Eleven months later, in June 2020, the patient developed intracranial hypertension symptoms (headache, diplopia, vomiting). CSF analysis showed hyperproteinorachia (0.49 g/L) and adenocarcinomatous cells (4%). Bone metastases and primary lung lesion did not progress. Molecular analysis identified EGFR L858R mutation without acquired T790M mutation in plasmatic and CSF analysis. Osimertinib (80 mg daily), as a second-line treatment, was started in combination with nineteen intrathecal methotrexate injections (15 mg biweekly). This treatment was well tolerated and led to neurological improvement with disappearance of tumor cells in CSF and normalization of proteinorachia.
