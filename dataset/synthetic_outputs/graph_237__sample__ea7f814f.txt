A 68-year-old male presented to the emergency department in June 2019 with a 3-week history of general malaise, rapid body weight loss (>5 kg), and poor appetite. He had a history of smoking one pack per day for more than 30 years but quit in 2018. He was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and left upper lobe squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (Pancoast tumor), stage cT4N1M0. Whole-body computed tomography (CT) showed tumor size >7 cm.

In June 2019, concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) was initiated with radiation at a dose of 60 Gy in 30 fractions with oral vinorelbine and cisplatin for stage IIIA (cT4, ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes) left upper lobe squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).

In February 2020, a follow-up CT image showed regression of the left upper lobe tumor.

In May 2020, the patient presented to the orthopedic outpatient department with a 10-day history of a rapidly progressing painful swelling on his right wrist. Systemic examination revealed a tender soft tissue swelling with increased local temperature located in the wrist of his right hand. The swelling was firm in consistency, oval-shaped, and 7 × 5 cm in size. The right wrist swelling was characterized by reddened skin, warmth, edema, and no discharging sinus. Pronation and supination were restricted. A forearm radiograph showed an oval osteolytic lesion with a cortical moth-eaten appearance over the distal ulnar area. MRI showed an osteolytic tumor in the distal ulnar shaft measuring 5.3 × 3.2 × 2.8 cm with a prominent heterogeneous extraosseous component at the central aspect. Angiography showed that the tumor in the right wrist was supplied mainly by the right anterior and posterior interosseous arteries and small ulnar artery branches. A whole-body 99m Tc-phosphate bone scan showed newly observed and isolated focally increased tracer uptake in the right distal ulna. A previous 99m Tc-phosphate bone scan from November 2019 showed minimal tracer uptake in the left ninth rib thought to be a post-traumatic change because of its pre-existing visibility. Bone and soft tissue tumor biopsies of the right wrist lesion were performed. Tissue sections showed that the bone and bone marrow were infiltrated by nests of poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells. The tumor cell nests displayed abundant neutrophil infiltration. The right wrist lesion pathology revealed poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells with abundant neutrophil infiltration and extremely focal keratinization.

In September 2020, the patient underwent continuous CCRT and was followed up at the outpatient department with no signs of progression. The patient chose limb preservation surgery after explanation of each advantage and disadvantage. After confirming the bone metastasis, wedge resection of the tumor was performed, followed by fixation for prevention of an impending pathological distal ulnar fracture with a cemented augmentation technique.
