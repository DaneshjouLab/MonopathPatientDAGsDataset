A 45-year-old man with lung adenocarcinoma (stage IV, cT4N3M1c) negative for driver gene mutation was treated with carboplatin (CBDCA), pemetrexed (PEM), and pembrolizumab. Following lung biopsy, computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography-CT, and head magnetic resonance imaging, he was diagnosed with stage IV (cT4N3M1c) adenocarcinoma with brain and bone metastases. On day 5 after chemotherapy initiation, blood test result showed grade 2 hepatitis based on the Common Terminology for Adverse Events (CTCAE) ver. 5 (AST 155 U/L; ALT 258 U/L). Fatigue, jaundice, loss of appetite, arthralgia, fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and ascites were not observed. Blood tests ruled out hepatitis B and C. There was no history of blood transfusion or travel abroad; no raw food was consumed; and the possibility of hepatitis A, D, and E was low. The patient had abstained from drinking alcohol since he was hospitalized. Thus, alcoholic liver disease was excluded.
