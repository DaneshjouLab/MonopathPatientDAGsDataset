In May 2020, a 59-year-old female was diagnosed with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by pathological biopsy at Tianjin First Central Hospital in Tianjin, China. The patient had no prior history of diabetes and was taking statins for elevated blood lipids. Her blood glucose levels were monitored and remained normal prior to starting immunotherapy. The patient also had Hashimoto's disease, with a high thyroid peroxidase autoantibody (TPOAb) titer of 35.2 \u00b5g/l. She did not take any medication for Hashimoto's disease, as she had no related symptoms.

The patient received five courses of carboplatin combined with pemetrexed chemotherapy. During chemotherapy, her fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels and thyroid function remained normal. After chemotherapy, the degree of PD-L1 expression in tumor samples was assessed, revealing that roughly 50% of the tumor cells stained positively for PD-L1.

Following chemotherapy, the patient received pembrolizumab at a dose of 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks. After five courses of carboplatin combined with pemetrexed chemotherapy, her BMI was 21.5 kg/m2, fasting blood glucose was 4.4 mmol/l, 2-hour postprandial blood glucose was 6.8 mmol/l, HbA1c was 5.3 %, thyroid-stimulating hormone was 2.5 mIU/l, FT3 was 3.7 pmol/l, FT4 was 13.6 pmol/l, TPOAb was 35.2 \u00b5g/l, and TgAb was 15.6 \u00b5g/l.
