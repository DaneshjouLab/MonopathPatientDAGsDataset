A 58-year-old female non-smoker was diagnosed with clinical T1aN3M0 stage IIIB adenocarcinoma (Figure 1(a), (b)). She received concurrent chemoradiotherapy consisting of cisplatin plus vinorelbine with thoracic radiotherapy of 60 Gy in 30 fractions. Computed tomography (CT) showed a good partial response after three cycles of this regimen. However, grade 1 radiation pneumonitis was identified on CT, and further consolidation chemotherapy was eventually discontinued. The lung cancer lesion and radiation pneumonitis were monitored with CT without any treatment. Four months later, radiation pneumonitis had improved on CT, but progressive disease was identified. Subsequently, the patient received 13 cycles of pemetrexed, five cycles of docetaxel, and six cycles of gemcitabine. Multiple brain metastases were identified on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and the lesions were treated with Gamma knife radiosurgery. Finally, lung cancer specimen analysis revealed an ALK rearrangement via FISH. The patient was then treated with crizotinib as fifth-line therapy for 21 months.
