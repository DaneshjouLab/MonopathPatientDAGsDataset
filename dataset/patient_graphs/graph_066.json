Lung CT scan revealed a 52x53 mm space-occupying lesion in the left lower lobe accompanied by peripheral obstructive inflammation, atelectasis, and multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum, located behind and below the left main bronchus, as well as adjacent to the left lower pulmonary vein. Lung cancer with hilar lymph node metastasis diagnosed. R0 resection deemed not possible. Lung puncture biopsy revealed keratinized squamous cell carcinoma. Immunohistochemical staining: CK5/6 positive, P63 positive, P40 positive, Ki-67 positive (10%), Napsin A negative, and CK7 negative.
