A 52-year-old male, diagnosed with primary lung adenocarcinoma in 2023, presented with severe, debilitating shoulder pain (VAS 9) in the low dorsal area. This prompted a CT scan, which revealed a compression fracture of the T8 vertebral body with multiple fracture lines and a mixed lytic-sclerotic tumor component, with the lytic aspect being more prominent in the anterior portion of the vertebral body. The CT scan also showed mild posterior wall prominence without significant stenosis of the vertebral canal. Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with a pathological fracture of the T8 vertebra due to metastasis. The patient was treated with microwave ablation and the SpineJack system due to an isolated, irregular compression fracture. An initial CT scan was performed to assess the lesion’s size, location, and radiological characteristics. The patient was positioned prone, and conscious sedation was administered using continuous intravenous infusion of fentanyl citrate (0.1 mg/2 mL diluted 1:10 with saline). Lidocaine (1–2%) was administered subcutaneously at the incision site using a 22-gauge intramuscular needle. Bupivacaine (0.25%–0.5%) was infiltrated around the periosteum using an 18-gauge spinal needle (88 mm). Needle placement was verified with fluoroscopic guidance.
