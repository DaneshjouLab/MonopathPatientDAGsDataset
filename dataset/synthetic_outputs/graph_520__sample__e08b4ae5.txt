In March 2010, a 41-year-old man with no history of smoking presented with epigastralgia. The patient developed a massive pericardial effusion requiring emergent pericardiocentesis. Imaging revealed multiple metastatic lung cancer (cT4N3M1c). Cytological examination of the pericardial effusion confirmed adenocarcinoma. The patient underwent 4 regimens of chemotherapy (cisplatin plus pemetrexed, S-1, amrubicin, and docetaxel), but disease progression was observed. Imaging findings at the time of initial diagnosis: Chest computed tomography scan shows a primary lesion in the right upper lobe and a massive pericardial effusion. F18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scan shows uptake by the primary lesion, mediastinal lymph nodes, and pelvic bone. In January 2012, biopsy of the primary lesion in the right upper lobe showed adenocarcinoma with ALK rearrangement via immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The patient was started on alectinib 300 mg twice daily and achieved a partial response.
