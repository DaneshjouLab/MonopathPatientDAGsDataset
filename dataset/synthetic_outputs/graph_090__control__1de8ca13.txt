A patient initially diagnosed with stage II esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) underwent radical surgery after three cycles of neoadjuvant therapy with cisplatin, albumin bound paclitaxel, and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Post-operative immunohistochemical staining confirmed the absence of the squamous cell carcinoma component and the presence of the neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) component. Specifically, staining was negative for CK5/6 and tumor protein p40, but positive for tumor protein p53, pan-cytokeratin, synaptophysin, and CD56. The patient was followed up for 5 months with no treatment or postoperative complications. This case suggests that histological transformation to esophageal neuroendocrine carcinoma (ENEC) is a potential mechanism of acquired resistance to ICIs in ESCC.
