A 61-year-old male presented with a history of longstanding abdominal pain, discomfort, bloating, and loss of appetite. He had no known history of chronic disease, and medications prescribed by general practitioners had failed to relieve his symptoms. The mild abdominal pain had persisted for several years, with increased frequency in the weeks leading up to presentation. The patient denied any history of smoking, alcohol consumption, or previous abdominal surgery. Physical examination revealed mild epigastric tenderness.

To investigate the cause of the abdominal pain, a workup was performed, including a hemogram and biochemistry panel, which were within normal limits. An abdominal CT scan detected multiple loculated collection areas in the abdomen. The largest collection was located in the subdiaphragmatic area at the anterior of the liver, adjacent to hepatic segments 8, 4, and 5, measuring 4.7 x 11 x 10 cm. The CT scan showed no solid components or pathological contrast enhancement. An indirect hemagglutination test result was < 1/80.

Based on the CT findings, a diagnostic laparotomy was performed. The laparotomy revealed a 10 x 15 cm yellowish-pink, soft, fluid-filled multiloculated cystic mass adhered to the anterior surface of the liver. Numerous similar small cystic lesions were scattered on the right paracolic area and peritoneal surfaces. All cystic lesions were excised with LigaSure and electrocautery. An appendectomy was also performed.

Post-operatively, axial and coronal CT scans of the abdomen confirmed the presence of a cystic mass (4.7 x 11 x 10 cm) compressing the liver and located at the subdiaphragmatic area adjacent to the liver, with no pathologic contrast enhancement. Gross examination of the surgically excised septated cystic tumor revealed a mass measuring 10 x 15 cm.

The patient had an uneventful postoperative course and was discharged on postoperative day 5.
