**Aletinib treatment for 2 non-small cell lung carcinoma patients carrying different novel *ALK* fusions**

This case report describes two NSCLC patients with novel *ALK* fusion variants who were treated with alectinib. The study identified two distinct novel *ALK* fusion variants in the two NSCLC patients, who were subsequently treated with alectinib.

Both patients were treated with oral administration of alectinib at a dosage of 600 mg twice a day.

One patient commenced on oral administration of alectinib at a dose of 600 mg, twice daily, from July 10, 2022. Notably, the mass was significantly reduced after 3 months of alectinib treatment and the patient's PFS has exceeded one year to date.

The other patient received oral administration of alectinib at a dosage of 600 mg, twice daily, from July 25, 2022, which led to a partial response. The mass was significantly reduced after 6 months of alectinib treatment.

The tumors in both patients were significantly decreased after alectinib treatment, achieving partial response. The patients with NSCLC and harboring either a *PNPT1*- *ALK* (Exon22:Exon20) fusion or a *TCEAL2*- *ALK* (Exon3:Exon19) fusion, experience favorable therapeutic outcomes through the administration of alectinib.
