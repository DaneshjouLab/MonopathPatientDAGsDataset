A 70-year-old woman with a history of acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), for which she was taking oral steroids with tapering, was diagnosed with stage IIIB squamous cell lung cancer by transbronchial lung biopsy from the left hilum 6 months prior to admission. Initially, she experienced anorexia due to the psychological impact of the cancer diagnosis and declined chemotherapy. Her symptoms subsequently improved with pharmacotherapy, and she was started on tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil. Thirty-six days after starting chemotherapy, she presented to the outpatient clinic for a lung cancer assessment via chest CT. She reported a 5-day history of chest pain, exacerbation of cough, and severe palpitations. Chest CT revealed the known lung cancer on the left hilum, abutting the pericardium, which had invaded the mediastinum, causing pneumopericardium and pneumomediastinum. Her blood pressure was 120/67 mm Hg, and her heart rate was 88 bpm. Physical examination revealed jugular vein distention (JVD) in the sitting position and muffled heart sounds. Echocardiography showed no reduction in ejection fraction, although the pneumopericardium prevented detailed observation.
