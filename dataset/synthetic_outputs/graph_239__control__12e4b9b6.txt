A 74-year-old man with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was treated with chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for lung cancer. During the treatment, he presented with vomiting and abdominal distention. CT showed pneumatosis from the esophagus to the small intestine. Severe radiation-induced esophagitis was observed, and gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a circumferential esophageal ulcer. From these observations, this case was diagnosed as pneumatosis intestinalis (PI) following severe esophagitis. A nasogastric tube was inserted, and conservative treatment with fasting, fluid replacement, and antibiotic was performed. Four days after the onset of PI, CT showed marked improvement of the pneumatosis.
