A patient presented with shortness of breath and bilateral upper extremity edema. Clinical examination revealed digital clubbing. The patient was diagnosed with stage IVB lung adenocarcinoma and bilateral malignant pleural effusion. Further investigation revealed superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome secondary to superior vena cava (SVC) obstruction, and upper extremity deep vein thrombosis. The patient also had a history of uterine myoma. The patient developed heart failure. The patient had metastatic lesions.

The patient's clinical course was complicated by recurrent pleural effusions, requiring multiple interventions. Initially, a pleuroperitoneal shunt was placed to manage the pleural effusion. The patient developed subclavian vein thrombosis and intravenous thrombosis, further complicating the SVC syndrome. The patient developed empyema and pleural adhesion. The patient had malignant pleuritis. Despite interventions, the patient continued to experience pleural effusions and shortness of breath. The patient required repeated pleuroperitoneal shunt placement for pleural effusion.
