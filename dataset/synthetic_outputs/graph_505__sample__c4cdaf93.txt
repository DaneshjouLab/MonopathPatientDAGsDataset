In March 2017, a 30-year-old male presented with a one-year history of recurrent headaches, progressive weight loss of approximately three months duration, persistent difficulty in breathing and cough for two months, and dizziness for one month. The headache was described as recurrent, initially frontal but later occipital, throbbing, with radiation to the neck, and associated with blurred vision, dizziness, weakness of the left limbs, and seizures. The patient reported four episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizures prior to presentation, each lasting less than five minutes.

Further history revealed intermittent fever, cough associated with hemoptysis, and dyspnea on exertion. The patient had a history of two pack-years of tobacco use, stopped 10 years prior, and had been treated for pulmonary tuberculosis two years prior. Physical examination revealed a conscious, ill-looking, and cachectic individual.

Vitals showed a fever of 38.5Â°C, pulse rate of 130 bpm, and blood pressure of 164/126 mmHg. Examination revealed dullness to percussion in the right middle lung zones, diminished breath sounds over the same areas, and left-sided hemiparesis and ataxia. Power on the left side was 3/5.

Initial investigations, including a full blood count (FBC), electrolytes, urea, and creatinine (EUCr), and liver function tests (LFTs), were normal. ELISA HIV tests were negative. A chest X-ray showed a large mass in the right middle lung zone extending to the hilum.

Subsequent chest CT scan revealed a mass infiltrating the right upper and middle lung lobes, measuring 10 cm x 10 cm. A brain CT revealed a 5 cm mass and a 4 cm intracranial mass in the posterior cranial fossa with perilesional edema. A provisional diagnosis of metastatic lung cancer with intracerebral metastases was made.

An open surgical lung biopsy was performed. The biopsy revealed interstitial mononuclear infiltrate, numerous foamy macrophages, and granuloma formation with congested capillaries, focal fibrosis, and thickening of the interstitial alveolar septa. Further analysis of the lung biopsy showed numerous oval-shaped, thick-walled yeast cells compatible with Cryptococcus spp. Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS) staining was strongly positive for fungal cell walls. Immunohistochemical stains for cytokeratin 5/6, thyroid transcription factor 1, and lymphoma markers were negative.

The patient was initially treated with oral flucytosine 1500 mg every 6 hours and intravenous fluconazole 800 mg once daily for 7 days. This was followed by intravenous Amphotericin B 50 mg daily for 14 days, then transitioned to oral flucytosine 1500 mg every 6 hours and oral fluconazole 400 mg daily for 8 weeks, followed by fluconazole 200 mg daily for 6 months. Renal and LFTs were monitored during the 8 weeks of induction and treatment, with LFT and EUCr results remaining normal during this time. Pulmonary aspirate and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures were negative for fungal growth, but there was residual radio-opacity in the lung. The patient experienced resolution of hemiparesis and cerebellar ataxia.
