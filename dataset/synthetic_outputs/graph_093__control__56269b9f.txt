A 65-year-old female was diagnosed with Adenocarcinoma (ADC) of the lung, the most frequent pathology corresponding to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The patient presented with two unusual mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene: exon 18 (g719x) and exon 20 (s768i). These mutations are typically resistant to standard therapy. The patient had no central nervous system (CNS) involvement. Osimertinib was administered due to its favorable toxicity profile and with a view to preventing future CNS relapse.
