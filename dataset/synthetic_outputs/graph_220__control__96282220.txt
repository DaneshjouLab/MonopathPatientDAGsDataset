A 69-year-old male with metastatic clear cell carcinoma of the kidney on sunitinib for 2 years, presented with recurrent episodes of haematemesis and melaena. This was on a background of atrial fibrillation with ischaemic stroke for which he was anticoagulated on warfarin. Initial endoscopic assessment identified an oozing gastric ulcer, which was managed with endoscopic adrenaline injection and clipping. He had recurrent melaena a few months after the initial presentation and repeat endoscopy revealed a bleeding duodenal polyp. Six months after this presentation he had further episodes of melaena requiring frequent blood transfusions. Repeat gastroscopy confirmed presence of gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE), which was managed with argon plasma coagulation. Due to disease progression with pulmonary metastasis, Sunitinib was ceased, and second-line therapy with cabozantinib was considered. Unfortunately, the patientâ€™s condition deteriorated due to hospital-acquired pneumonia and fluid overload.

Ten years later while on surveillance, he experienced abdominal pain, and an abdominal ultrasound revealed a pancreatic lesion. Two years later, he presented with upper GI bleeding and melaena. Additionally, his pulmonary metastasis led to tracheal involvement, causing obstructive symptoms. Despite undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy, his disease progressed, prompting a transition to palliative care. He subsequently succumbed to complications arising from tracheal involvement. Two months later, he suffered a fatal upper GI bleeding event.
