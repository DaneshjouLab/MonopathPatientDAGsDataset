A rare case of malignant mesothelioma of the tunica vaginalis testis is presented. Malignant mesothelioma of the tunica vaginalis testis is a rare, highly invasive urogenital malignant tumor with no specific clinical manifestations. Reported cases of this disease are limited, making early preoperative diagnosis difficult.

A 52-year-old man was admitted to Xiaoshan Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University (Hangzhou, China) in December 2022. He underwent radical resection of the right testicle and epididymis. Postoperatively, he did not undergo radiotherapy or chemotherapy. The patient was followed up for 5 months, and no recurrence or metastasis was found.

Malignant mesothelioma of the tunica vaginalis testis is a rare tumor that accounts for <1% of all mesothelioma cases. It can occur at any age; however, the majority of patients are between 55 and 75 years of age, with occasional cases in adolescents. Since its first recording in 1957, <300 cases have been reported worldwide. The most common clinical manifestation of this disease is scrotal enlargement with an unexplained hydrocele; a small number of patients present with internal scrotal masses and pain in the inguinal area.
