Here, we present a case of *Strongyloides* parasitic infection as an uncommon differential for eosinophilia in a patient with lung cancer receiving a PDL‐1 ICI, durvalumab, in Australia. We present a case of a 64‐year-old male, diagnosed in August 2020 with stage 3A left non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A positron emission tomography (PET) scan at diagnosis showed a large left hilar mass, with small mediastinal nodes. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) guided biopsy confirmed carcinoma for which immunohistochemistry (IHC) was positive for P40 and negative for thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1), consistent with squamous cell carcinoma. Programmed death-ligand 1 (PDL1) was low at 20%. He received 6 weeks of definitive concurrent chemo-radiotherapy with weekly carboplatin and paclitaxel. He developed a mild infusion reaction to the last two doses of paclitaxel which required steroid pre-medications. Pathology workup including eosinophil count was normal at this point. A PET scan and brain magnetic resonance imaging scan at completion of chemo-radiotherapy showed good response to treatment. He then commenced two weekly maintenance therapy with durvalumab, an ICI, in October 2020, as per the PACIFIC trial. After the first dose of durvalumab, he was noted to have eosinophilia of 5.4 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L (<0.5) on routine blood work-up. He was well, and asymptomatic. Specifically there were no symptoms to suggest toxicities from durvalumab. Therefore, he proceeded to cycles 2 and 3 of durvalumab. The eosinophil count continued to rise, and 4 weeks later, post cycle 3 of durvalumab, peaked at 12. This case highlights the complexities exploring the multiple potential causes of eosinophilia and the subsequent management, to allow safe continuation of ICI.
