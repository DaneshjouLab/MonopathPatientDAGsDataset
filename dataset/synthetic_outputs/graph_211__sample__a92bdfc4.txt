A 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, thalassemia trait, knee osteoarthritis, and hyperthyroidism presented with bloating, abdominal discomfort, and a change in stool caliber for a couple of days over the previous few weeks. She denied eating a fatty diet, alcohol consumption, or frequent intake of dairy products. She reported no respiratory symptoms, appetite loss, or cachexia and was a life-long nonsmoker.

Physical examination was unremarkable: she was breathing comfortably with normal breath sounds on auscultation; her abdomen was soft without tenderness or guarding; and there was no lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, abdominal mass, or stigmata of chronic liver disease. Her medications included calcium carbonate, calciferol, and atenolol.

The patient underwent a colonoscopy, which revealed multiple polyps. These were removed by biopsy forceps and cold snare, and pathological examination identified them as hyperplastic.

The patient also underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), which revealed 2 F2 varices and 1 F1 varix between 30 and 35 cm from the incisors, located in the midesophagus and not extending to the esophagogastric junction. A few benign squamous papillomata and a venous bleb were observed at 39 cm from the incisors, just proximal to the esophagogastric junction. The mucosa distal to the varices was normal, and no gastric varices were seen.

A chest x-ray showed a barely detectable reticular-ground glass opacity in the right upper zone. Subsequent CT of the chest and neck revealed a 2.7-cm pulmonary nodule located at the periphery of the right upper lung, adjacent to the pleura and far superolateral to the SVC without SVC contact and obstruction. No neck mass was seen, but subcentimeter lymph nodes with internal microcalcification were noted at the left cervical IIb level, posterior to the spinal accessory nerve and internal jugular vein. No thyroid nodules and no liver cirrhosis were found.

A lung biopsy revealed adenocarcinoma in the 2.7-cm nodule at the periphery of the right upper lung.

The patient underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery with right upper lobe lobectomy and lymph node biopsy. Pathological examination showed a lepidic-predominant invasive adenocarcinoma, total size of 2.7 cm, with an invasive tumor size of 1.1 cm in the greatest dimension, with acinar pattern at the periphery of the lung and close to pleura. Visceral pleural invasion was not identified. Lymphovascular invasion and vascular thrombosis were not seen. No evidence of metastatic carcinoma was found in the dissected lymph nodes of hilar, interlobar, right paratracheal, and subcarinal area. Vascular abnormalities associated with pulmonary hypertension were not detected. EGFR gene mutational analysis revealed EGFR c.2573T>G (L858R) mutation. Clear resection margins were seen. Tumor staging was T1bN0M0.

The patient recovered postoperatively and remains well at 12 months.
