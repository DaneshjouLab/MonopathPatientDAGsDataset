An elderly woman presented with a rapidly growing, substantially large fungating neck lump. The lump was later revealed to be a cutaneous metastasis secondary to squamous cell carcinoma of the lungs. Lung cancer is a common malignancy with a poor prognosis and a five-year survival rate of around 15%. Common sites of metastasis include the liver, brain, adrenal glands, hilar nodes, and bone. Metastasis to the skin is uncommon, occurring in 0.7%-9% of cases.
