A patient with a 3-year history of primary hypertension, managed with indapamide 2.5 mg daily to maintain a blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg, was undergoing treatment for non-small cell lung cancer with Endostar. After completing Endostar treatment, the patient developed acute pericardial tamponade. A computed tomography (CT) examination on the third day confirmed the diagnosis. A review of previous lung CT and electrocardiogram indicated an enlarged cardiac silhouette and minimal pericardial and left pleural effusion. An emergency CT scan detected pericardial tamponade and significant deviations in several blood parameters from pretreatment values. An urgent CT examination was performed, which indicated acute pericardial tamponade and massive pericardial effusion, significantly increased compared to before the administration of Endostar. Cardiology consultation recommended pericardiocentesis to alleviate symptoms. However, the patient and his family declined further interventions, and the patient was discharged. The patient died on November 2, 2021.
