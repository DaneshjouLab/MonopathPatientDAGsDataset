Following anti-infection and anti-viral treatment with Vancomycin, the patient underwent a repeat enhanced chest CT on May 29, 2023. The CT scan revealed an irregular thin-walled cystic lesion in the right upper lobe with fine line compartments, measuring approximately 32\u00d725\u00d727 mm, with enlarged and moderately enhanced lymph nodes in the 10R, 4R, and 2R regions. Compared to the March 3, 2023 CT, the solid component of the right upper lobe mass had essentially disappeared, and the mediastinal lymph nodes were similar in size. Response assessment indicated partial remission. Subsequently, the patient received a second cycle of immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy.
