A 50-year-old man was referred for interventional pulmonary evaluation from oncology. The patient presented with a paraesophageal mass and slightly positive mediastinal lymph nodes (SUV â‰¥3) on PET-CT and CT thorax. The patient was intubated for staging of lymph nodes (stations 2R/L, 4R/L, 7, 10R/L and 11R/L). CP-EBUS (PENTAX EB-1970UK) was inserted through the esophagus and biopsy of the paraesophageal mass was performed with a 22G needle. CT thorax with IV contrast showed no intrabronchial lesions. PET-CT showed positive lymph node stations 10R, 7, and 10L (N3 status). EUB 6500HV ultrasound showed lymph nodes at stations 4L, 7, and 11L. The paraesophageal mass was also imaged. The patient was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma with N3 category. PD-L1 expression was 90%, and the patient received pembrolizumab as first-line treatment. Tumor cells were positive for (A) TTF1 x10, (B) cell block x10 and (C) pap smear x10.
