A 77-year-old man was referred to the hospital for abnormal thoracic radiographs. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a 20-mm subpleural ground-glass opacity in the right S6 area. A CT-guided biopsy revealed lung adenocarcinoma. Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography revealed multiple abnormal bone accumulations, and a subsequent biopsy of a left iliac bone lesion revealed chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The case presents lung adenocarcinoma with chronic lymphocytic leukemia mimicking bone metastasis.
