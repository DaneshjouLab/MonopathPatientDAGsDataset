A 62-year-old male farmer with a 30-year smoking history (360 pack-years), suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pulmonary bullae, was admitted to the hospital for intermittent hemoptysis of approximately 2 years duration. Prior to admission, he had been diagnosed with and treated for pneumonia and bronchiectasis with antibiotics and hemostatics, but a definite diagnosis for the hemoptysis could not be established.

A thorax-computed tomography revealed narrowing of the bronchus of the left lower lobe with associated local atelectasis, raising suspicion for lung cancer. To confirm the diagnosis and exclude lung cancer, a bronchoscopy was performed. The bronchoscopy showed a slit-like stenosis at the dorsal bronchial segment of the left lower lobe, swollen and smooth mucosa, and a significantly wider subsection carina.

During biopsy at the carina of the dorsal bronchial segment, a large hemorrhage occurred immediately. The patient developed hemorrhagic shock, and anti-shock measures were implemented, including intravenous infusion with polygeline, compound sodium chloride solution, dopamine, and type-A erythrocyte suspension.

Three hours later, the patient developed a recurrent massive hemoptysis. Double-lumen endotracheal intubation was performed immediately, and single-lung ventilation was started to maintain oxygenation. A fatal hemorrhage occurred during biopsy and, rescue and resuscitation measures were immediately taken. Hemoptysis completely stopped after bronchial artery embolization. However, the patient eventually died of disseminative intravascular coagulation and multiple organ failure.

This case highlights the potential for bronchial Dieulafoy's disease to cause massive or fatal hemoptysis. Dieulafoy's lesions are characterized by the presence of a dysplastic artery in the submucosa, most frequently associated with gastrointestinal hemorrhage, but rarely identified in the bronchial submucosa. In cases with recurrent unexplained hemoptysis, where CT chest or thoracic radiography show no abnormalities, pulmonologists should suspect a bronchial Dieulafoy's disease and avoid blindly performing bronchoscopy guided biopsy, which may result in fatal hemoptysis.
