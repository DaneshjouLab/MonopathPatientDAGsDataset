Cervico-thoracic CT imaging revealed multiple nodular shadows of various sizes within the right cervical region posterior to the sternocleidomastoid muscle and adjacent to the carotid artery sheath, which partially fused. The largest measured approximately 3.8 cm x 2.6 cm with indistinct margins and uneven ring-shaped enhancement. CT imaging revealed compression of the right parapharyngeal soft tissue and right jugular vein. Enlarged and partially fused lymph nodes were identified in the mediastinum. A 9.8 cm x 8.0 cm round mass with well-defined borders, uneven density, and heterogeneous enhancement was identified in the extra-basal segment of the left lower lung lobe. Suspected pulmonary malignancy with cervical and mediastinal lymph node metastasis.",
