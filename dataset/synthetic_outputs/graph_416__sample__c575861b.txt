A 58-year-old female with a 15-pack-year smoking history and 15 years of occupational exposure to respiratory toxins was admitted for management of a right pleural effusion. Her comorbidities included grand mal epilepsy, stage II hypertension, hypertensive heart disease with preserved ejection fraction, grade I obesity, hysterectomy in 2001 for uteroplacental apoplexy, and surgically induced menopause at age 34. She presented with progressive dyspnea (mMRC score 2), right posterior chest pain radiating to the anterior chest, and intermittent low-grade fever (37.2°C to 38°C).

The patient presented to the emergency department, and a chest X-ray revealed changes suggestive of a moderate right pleural effusion. Antibiotic and symptomatic treatment was initiated. A chest CT scan confirmed a significant right pleural effusion, fused at the level of the oblique fissure causing passive collapse of the subpleural lung parenchyma.

Due to the significant right pleural effusion, the patient was referred to clinic and directed to local pneumology service. Further diagnostic workup was pursued, including right thoracentesis, draining approximately 600 ml of serous fluid with biochemical characteristics of exudate and cytology showing atypical cells suggestive of malignancy. A right pleural biopsy was non-diagnostic due to chronic inflammatory changes. Labs showed elevated ESR (60 mm/h) and platelet count (451.000 103/μL), and low creatinine (0.39 mg/dL). Other lab values included: Hemoglobin 12.70 g/dL, Hematocrit 38.90%, Total leukocyte count 8.01 103/μL, Lymphocyte % 31.70, Monocyte % 4.9, Eosinophils % 3, Basophil % 0.90, Urea 23 mg/dL, AST 18 U/L, ALT 25 U/L, and Fibrinogen 429 mg/dL.

Fiberoptic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage was performed to further investigate the cause of the pleural effusion. Results showed a normal larynx, diffuse bronchitis, and no evidence of pathogenic organisms. Microbiological tests for non-specific flora, mycology, and Ziehl-Neelsen staining showed no evidence of pathogenic organisms.

The patient opted to postpone thoracoscopy with pleural biopsy and instead chose a watchful waiting approach.
