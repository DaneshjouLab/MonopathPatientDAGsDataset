A 70-year-old man with a history of mitral valve replacement and maze procedure for atrial fibrillation, performed via median sternotomy 2 years prior, presented for follow-up. Surveillance chest X-ray revealed a gradual increase in right pleural effusion. Subsequent chest CT confirmed the right pleural effusion and revealed pleural thickening. A right pleural biopsy, performed via VATS, revealed epithelial malignant pleural mesothelioma. PET-CT staging showed no lymph node or distant metastases, classifying the MPM as c-T3N0M0 Stage IB (IASLC 8th edition).

The patient received three courses of cisplatin plus pemetrexed neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Post-chemotherapy chest CT showed a 2 x 2 cm tumor in contact with the right atrium, with invasion not ruled out. A subsequent PET-CT after neoadjuvant chemotherapy showed no lymph node or distant metastases and stable disease (SD).

A decision was made to proceed with pleurectomy/decortication (P/D) as a curative surgery. During the procedure, strong adhesions on the mediastinal side were noted, likely due to the previous cardiac surgery via median sternotomy. Extracorporeal circulation was placed on standby in preparation for massive bleeding, especially in case of right atrial rupture. A pleurectomy/decortication (P/D) technique without any pleural incision was performed to achieve en bloc removal of the entire pleura. A posterolateral incision was made, and a P/D seventh costal bed thoracotomy was performed. Extrapleural dissection was initiated using the fingers. The tumor apex was strongly adhered to the mediastinal side, especially to the back of the sternum, due to the previous cardiac surgery, requiring careful peeling. Post-operative chest CT showed the tumor was in contact with the pericardium, with suspected direct invasion.
