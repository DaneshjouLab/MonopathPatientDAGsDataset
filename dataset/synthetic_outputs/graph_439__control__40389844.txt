A 58-year-old male presented with cough and dyspnea for several months. He was suspected of heart failure at a previous hospital because of pleural effusion in the chest radiography. He was referred to our hospital and a pleurocentesis was performed, with cytologic studies demonstrating atypical cells with hyperchromatic nuclei, prominent nucleoli and abundant eosinophilic and granular cytoplasm consistent with adenocarcinoma. Whole-body CT scan and bone scintigraphy revealed metastases involving the bones, pleura, left lung, and brain. Three cycles of S-1 chemotherapy (tegafur, 5-chloro-2,4-dihydroxypyridine, and potassium oxonate) were administered, with tumor size reduction. Adjuvant radiotherapy and narcotic analgesia were combined afterward. The CT scan performed after six months of the diagnosis revealed an increasing size of the tumors in both lungs. In addition, two liver nodules were detected. The growing tumors in the right lung caused obstructive pneumonia, and the patient died of hypoxia six months after the initial presentation. The thoracic cavity contained more than 500 ml of hemorrhagic pleural effusion on the right side, with 200 ml of pale-yellow pleural effusion on the left. In the right lung, the pleura was thickened, the parenchyma was hardened, and the volume of the aerated region was decreased.
