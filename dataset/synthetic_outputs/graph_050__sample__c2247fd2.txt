In February 2022, a 67-year-old man with an ECOG performance status of 1 and a 40 pack-year smoking history presented with chest tightness. Physical examination revealed left supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, approximately 1 cm in size. A chest CT scan showed a 2 cm mass in the posterior basal segment of the left lower lobe, characterized by multiple burrs on the edge and enhancement. Mediastinal lymph nodes were enlarged and fused, surrounding the left main bronchus. An abdominal enhanced CT scan indicated enlargement of the left adrenal gland, considered to be a metastatic lesion. Emission computed tomography (ECT) whole-body bone imaging and brain enhanced MRI showed no obvious abnormalities. Immunohistochemical (IHC) markers were CK-pan and P40 positive.

On March 10, 2022, a CT-guided lung puncture biopsy was performed. Pathology suggested poorly differentiated carcinoma. Immunohistochemistry revealed CK-pan (+), CK7 (–), TTF-1 (–), P40 (+), BRG-1 (–), and Syn (–). Dako PD-L1 22C3 assay showed a tumor proportion score (TPS) of 8%. Second-generation gene detection of tumor tissue did not reveal any target-sensitive mutations.

Based on these findings, a diagnosis of SMARCA4-deficient non-small cell lung cancer (SMARCA4-dNSCLC) was made. First-line treatment was initiated with tislelizumab combined with fruquintinib. Initial efficacy assessment showed partial remission of the lesion.

By April 1, 2022, cervical lymph node progression occurred. Diagnosis was confirmed via subsequent biopsy. The patient was treated with local radiotherapy and previous systemic therapy. He achieved more than two years of disease control without grade ≥3 adverse events.
