A 54-year-old male presented with a cough and was diagnosed with stage IIIB (pT1N3M0) upper right lung adenocarcinoma carrying the EML4-ALK fusion gene. Clinically, the patient had multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the right hilum and mediastinum, with the largest measuring approximately 28Ã—19 mm by CT scan, and the L4 lymph node was invaded by metastasis. The patient received one cycle of chemotherapy with paclitaxel in combination with nedaplatin, followed by maintenance treatment with lorlatinib. Two months later, clinical evaluations revealed progressive reduction of the lesions, especially the reduced size of the mediastinal lymph nodes. The patient then underwent thoracoscopic partial lobectomy and lymphadenectomy and achieved pathological complete response (pCR). After 3 months, a follow-up CT scan was similar to the first postoperative CT scan, and no tumor was found. This case demonstrates the potential advantage of lorlatinib as a neoadjuvant therapy in advanced ALK-positive NSCLC.
