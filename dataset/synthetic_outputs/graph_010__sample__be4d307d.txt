A 55-year-old female was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the esophagus (cT3N2M0, stage IIIB). She underwent esophagectomy with gastric pull-up reconstruction, followed by neo-adjuvant concurrent chemoradiation therapy (ypT2N1 stage IIB disease). The chemoradiation consisted of a total of 50 Gray of radiation over 6 weeks, along with Carboplatin and Paclitaxel treatment for 6 weeks.

Six years later, a computed tomography (CT) scan showed stage IA Thyroid Transcription Factor-1 (TTF-1) positive adenocarcinoma in the left upper lobe. The patient was treated with stereotactic radiotherapy.

Two years after stereotactic radiotherapy, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the right upper lobe (RUL) was discovered. Pembrolizumab was initiated with curative intent due to high Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression. However, a follow-up CT scan showed no biological response, and the tumor diameter was 54 mm.

Subsequently, the patient underwent salvage lobectomy including complete mediastinal lymph node dissection. A pre-operative positron emission tomography CT scan demonstrated the exact localization of the tumor in the right upper lobe.
