A patient presented with dysphagia and epigastralgia. The patient had a history of primary lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), for which they underwent thoracoscopic lower lobectomy. Following surgery, the patient received adjuvant chemotherapy with uracil and tegafur.

Some time later, the patient developed progressive dysphagia and epigastric pain. Computed tomography revealed a gastric fundal mass. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed a subepithelial and ulcerated mass in the gastric cardia. Endoscopic biopsies and gastric biopsies were performed. Histopathology and histopathological examination confirmed SCC, indicating gastric metastasis of the primary lung SCC.

The patient underwent proximal gastrectomy with resection of the diaphragmatic crus to address the gastric metastasis.
