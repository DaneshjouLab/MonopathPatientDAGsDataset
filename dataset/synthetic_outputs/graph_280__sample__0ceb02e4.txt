A 59-year-old female with a history of asbestos exposure presented on February 11, 2017, with abdominal distension and weakness. Imaging revealed cirrhosis, splenomegaly, portal hypertension, and peritoneal effusion. Tumor indicators showed no obvious abnormalities on February 13, 2017. Abdominal effusion revealed shed cancer cells. Imaging diagnosis indicated a large amount of ascites.

On March 22, 2017, abdominal mesentery was slightly thickened. Laparoscopic peritoneal biopsy was performed, and hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed heterogeneous cell nests in the parietal peritoneal fiber tissue accompanied by degeneration. Immunohistochemical findings were Calretinin (+), WT-1 (\u00b1), and D2-40 (+), suggesting malignant mesothelioma. CDX-2 (\u2212) excluded tumors from the digestive tract, and ER (\u2212) excluded breast metastases. The patient was diagnosed with malignant mesothelioma.

The patient received nine cycles of pemetrexed combined with cisplatin (intravenous injection and abdominal perfusion) starting in March 2017. Clinical efficacy evaluation in October 2017 suggested disease progression, with increased ascites, local thickening of the peritoneum, and turbidity in the fat space of the mesentery.

The treatment plan was changed to gemcitabine combined with local intra-cavity perfusion. On February 19, 2020, follow-up assessment revealed the peritoneal lesion was larger than before. Gemcitabine chemotherapy was administered for four cycles due to the enlarged peritoneal lesion.

Laparoscopic peritoneal mesothelioma resection was performed on May 8, 2020, due to poor efficacy of gemcitabine chemotherapy. Peritoneal lesions were removed, and pathological examination was performed. Gemcitabine chemotherapy was continued twice after surgery.

On February 24, 2021, re-examination indicated that the tuberculum of the anterior hepatis was significantly larger than that of October 2020. On March 8, 2021, Laparoscopic peritoneal mesothelioma resection was performed again, and the tuberculum of the anterior hepatis was removed for pathological examination. After surgery, gemcitabine local infusion chemotherapy combined with deep tumor hyperthermia was administered four times.

In August 2021, a review showed the progression of the disease, and treatment began with immunotherapy combined with hyperthermia and chemotherapy, specifically Camrelizumab combined with Gemcitabine/cisplatin/pemetrexed.
