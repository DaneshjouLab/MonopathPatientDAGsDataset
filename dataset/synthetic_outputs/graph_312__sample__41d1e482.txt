A 60-year-old man with a history of bullous emphysema presented with a dull ache over the left lumbar region. The patient is an ex-smoker (40 pack-years) and has a family history of lung cancer (mother) and bowel cancer (maternal uncle). Three prior CT scans of the chest over the preceding 2 years revealed widespread atelectasis in the upper lobes on a background of severe bullous emphysema, yet no pulmonary nodules or lesions were reported as being suspicious for malignancy. During an abdominal CT scan performed to investigate the lumbar pain, a large left-sided 47 mm heterogeneous adrenal mass with a precontrast density of 48 HU was incidentally discovered. Further characterization with MRI confirmed a left adrenal lesion of 42x27 mm with no signal drop-out on opposed phase imaging and heterogeneous enhancement post intravenous contrast, suggestive of an indeterminate adrenal mass based on radiological characteristics. Electrolytes, plasma metanephrine levels and urinary free cortisol levels were normal. A urinary steroid profile was performed. An open adrenalectomy was planned for presumed primary adrenocortical carcinoma. Pre-operative staging with 18F FDG PET/CT from midbrain to upper thigh revealed increased FDG uptake in the enlarged left adrenal gland (SUVmax=18.8) and a left upper lobe nodule just above the left hilum (SUVmax=7.1). Evidence of invasion into the diaphragm was also noted.
