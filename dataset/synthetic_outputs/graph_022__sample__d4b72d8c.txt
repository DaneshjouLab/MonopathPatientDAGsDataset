A 77-year-old man presented with left-sided hearing loss, otalgia, and a red mass in the left external auditory canal (EAC) that had persisted for several weeks. His medical history included hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and right-sided hearing loss due to chronic otitis media. He was a heavy smoker with no prior history of malignancy. Physical examination revealed a red, soft mass measuring approximately 20 mm occupying the left EAC.

A CT scan revealed masses in the left EAC and middle ear, right upper lung lobe, and pancreatic body. The EAC mass filled the entire canal and extended into the mastoid (CT and MRI findings). Laboratory tests showed normal Span-1 and DUPAN2 levels, but elevated ProGRP (698 pg/mL) and NSE (31.1 ng/mL). Pure-tone audiometry (PTA) revealed bilateral mixed hearing loss, averaging 72.5 dB in the right ear and 78.8 dB in the left ear (500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz).

Biopsies were obtained from the EAC mass, lung mass, and pancreatic mass to differentiate between primary and metastatic EAC carcinoma. The red mass occupied the external auditory canal before chemotherapy. Computed tomography findings showed a mass in the right upper lobe of the lung and a mass in the pancreatic body. Destruction of the left mastoid was also noted.

Pathology from all lesions revealed small cell tumors with a high nuclear\u2010to\u2010cytoplasmic ratio on Hematoxylin and eosin staining. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated positivity for synaptophysin, chromogranin A, and cytokeratin AE1/3, whereas CK20 was negative in all lesions. Biopsy specimens confirmed small cell lung cancer (SCLC), and thyroid transcription factor\u20101 (TTF\u20101) positivity in the EAC and pancreatic lesions suggested a primary tumor in the lung.

Chemotherapy was initiated with carboplatin, etoposide, and zoledronic acid for bone metastases. The metastatic lesions in the EAC and middle ear reduced in size. Hearing impairment and otalgia improved. Pure-tone audiometry (PTA) showed improvement in left-sided mixed hearing loss, with average threshold reducing to 57.5 dB. Regression of the mass after chemotherapy was observed.

The patient died 15 months later. Autopsy revealed resolution of EAC lesions grossly. CT imaging revealed mastoid destruction and tumor invasion into the EAC. The patient experienced severe hearing loss but regained the ability to understand conversations as the tumor shrank. Otalgia resolved, and opioid therapy was discontinued.
