A 70-year-old female was diagnosed with atypical carcinoid, a rare neuroendocrine tumor originating from the bronchopulmonary tree, with metastasis to the liver and axial skeleton. The patient did not respond to standard of care chemotherapy with carboplatin and etoposide and, due to worsening clinical status, was elected to enroll in hospice. A circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) sample revealed an *EML4-ALK* fusion gene. The patient immediately began therapy with the second-generation ALK inhibitor alectinib, resulting in a remarkable symptomatic and radiographic response. Seven months later, disease progression was demonstrated in the liver, and the patient was switched to the third-generation ALK inhibitor lorlatinib. At the time of writing, the patient has continued to demonstrate sustained clinical, radiographic, and biochemical responses while on lorlatinib for two years.
