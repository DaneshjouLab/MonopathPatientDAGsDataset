In October 2018, a 58-year-old male with a history of depression and a smoking history of 1 pack/day for 38 years presented to the hospital. Chest CT revealed a tumor in the right upper lung lobe with mediastinal invasion, superior vena cava (SVC) constriction, and enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. Following the chest CT findings, a transbronchial lung biopsy was performed, which revealed adenocarcinoma. After the adenocarcinoma diagnosis, mutational analysis and further imaging were performed. Mutational analysis for EGFR, ALK, ROS1, and BRAF were negative. PD-L1 tumor proportion score was 20%. Brain MRI showed brain metastases. PET/CT showed no other distant metastases. Based on the diagnostic workup, the patient was diagnosed with cT4N2M1c, stage IVB lung adenocarcinoma. The patient then underwent stereotactic radiotherapy for brain metastases, followed by 4 cycles of cisplatin (75 mg/m2) with pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) as first-line therapy and 3 cycles of pembrolizumab (200 mg/body) as second-line therapy. Despite treatment, the chemotherapies were ineffective, and the patient was considered to have progressive disease (PD) based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. Chest radiography showed massive left pleural effusion and pericardial effusion. The patient's condition worsened, leading to hospital admission in May 2019. Admission chest X-ray showed a mediastinal mass, left pleural effusion, and enlarged cardiac silhouette. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed superior vena cava obstruction by a large lung mass with mediastinal invasion, left pleural effusion, and marked pericardial effusion. Chest CT illustrated SVC obstruction and chest wall collaterals.
