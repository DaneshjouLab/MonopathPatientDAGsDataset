A 67-year-old Japanese man with locally advanced squamous cell lung cancer developed radiation pneumonitis after radical radiotherapy with concurrent carboplatin and paclitaxel followed by durvalumab. During the steroid treatment for radiation pneumonitis, he experienced a cough that worsened after drinking liquids. Chest X-ray revealed the formation of a cavity in the mediastinum shadow and a chest CT scan also showed a cavity in the right lower lobe, where the lung cancer was originally located, and communicated with the bronchus intermedius. Furthermore, the broncho-oesophageal fistula was diagnosed using oesophagography. Despite treatment, including an oesophageal stent for broncho-oesophageal fistula, he died of massive hemoptysis. We confirmed the cavity as the origin of bleeding following pathological autopsy. Broncho-oesophageal fistula is defined as a communication between bronchus and oesophagus and divided into congenital or acquired. The causes of acquired broncho-oesophageal fistula include malignancy, infections and trauma.
