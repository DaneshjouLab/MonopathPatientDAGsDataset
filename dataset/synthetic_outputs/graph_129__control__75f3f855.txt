A patient presented with pneumothorax. The etiology was determined to be primary spontaneous pneumothorax (Primary SPx) in some instances, and secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (Secondary SPx) in others. Underlying conditions contributing to the pneumothorax included COPD, bullous disease, and emphysema/emphysematous lung changes.

Further investigation revealed the presence of lung cancer. The specific types of lung cancer identified included non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), adeno/squamous cell carcinomas, and small cell lung carcinoma. In one instance, the small cell carcinoma was classified as limited-stage. Metastatic lesions were also discovered, including intracranial metastasis. The lung cancer, or pulmonary tumour, was also associated with bronchopleural fistula in at least one instance.

The patient's condition was further complicated by airflow obstruction.
