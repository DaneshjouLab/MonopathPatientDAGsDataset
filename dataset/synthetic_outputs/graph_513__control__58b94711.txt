A 49-year-old woman was diagnosed with stage IB adenocarcinoma in 2011 after open right middle lobe (RML) resection and systematic lymph node dissection. She received four cycles of adjuvant Navelbine and cisplatin chemotherapy after surgery. Four years after surgery, the patient was found to have ipsilateral lung metastasis. Gene detection of specimen revealed an exon 21 Leu858Arg substitution (L858R), and an oral gefitinib targeted therapy was applied to the patient. Three months after target therapy, chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed that the metastatic lesion was significantly reduced, and a 3-month interval CT scan follow-up showed the lesion was in a stable condition. Twenty-seven months after target therapy, the metastatic lesion began to grow, which was considered as a sign of resistance to gefitinib. After multiple disciplinary team (MDT) discussion, the patient received salvage surgery of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) wedge resection of the metastatic lesion. The postoperative pathological result and gene analysis indicated adenocarcinoma with EGFR L858R and T790M mutations. However, osimertinib was not available in China at that time, and the patient refused chemotherapy. MDT discussion suggested that the patient should continue gefitinib maintenance therapy after surgery. The patient developed into brain metastasis 10 months after surgery, and osimertinib combined with stereotactic radiosurgery was applied. Twelve months after the combined therapy, the patient was found to have bone and liver metastasis, along with progression of the brain metastatic lesion. Though the patient was given the best supportive care, she died of multiple organ dysfunction 9 months later.
