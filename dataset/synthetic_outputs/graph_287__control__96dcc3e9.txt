A patient with advanced adenocarcinoma harboring uncommon EGFR mutations developed acquired T790M resistance mutation. This case highlights the challenges in treating non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with uncommon EGFR mutations. Osimertinib is typically the standard of care for NSCLC patients with acquired EGFR T790M resistance mutation. However, the prognosis could be poor despite the presence of an acquired T790M resistance mutation, even after EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) treatment. The findings suggest that the T790M resistance mutation can occur even when the patient harbors an uncommon EGFR mutation after EGFR-TKI treatment. Further understanding of the clinical characteristics may help in the optimization of strategies to provide the maximum clinical benefit in patients with NSCLC harboring uncommon EGFR mutations.
