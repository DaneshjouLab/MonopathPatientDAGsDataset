A 69-year-old male with a 10-year history of arterial hypertension presented with chest tightness and shortness of breath for 2 months and a dry cough for half a month. Chest CT revealed an infection in the upper lobe of the left lung and a lesion in the left hilar region. Antibiotic treatment was administered, but repeat chest CT scan revealed no significant changes in the mediastinum or left hilar mass. Chest contrast-enhanced CT revealed a lesion in the left hilar region measuring approximately 43 \u00d7 63 mm and encroaching on the left pulmonary artery, suggesting malignancy. CT-guided percutaneous core needle biopsy of the left hilar lesion was performed. CT scan revealed hypodense lesions in a small portion of the ill-defined part of the left hilar mass. Morphological analysis of the left hilar biopsy tissue revealed nests, beams, and chrysanthemum-shaped clusters of arranged cells. The tumor cells were small, with little cytoplasm, indistinct cell boundaries, fine chromatin, and a lack of nucleoli. IHC staining of the left hilar lesion biopsy revealed that the tumor cells were positive for CK, TTF-1, CD56, and Syn, and the Ki-67 index was approximately 90%. Pathological diagnosis: poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma (small cell carcinoma).
