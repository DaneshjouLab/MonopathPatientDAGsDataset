A 63-year-old woman, never smoker, presented to the hospital with a complaint of cough and blood in sputum for one month. Cachexia was noted on physical examination. Initial CT chest showed two right-lower lobe lung nodules, with the largest nodule measuring 2.1 cm, as well as a pleural-based nodule and enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. CT abdomen pelvis revealed a pancreatic mass. MRI brain showed several nodular densities suggestive of metastatic disease despite absence of symptoms. Bronchial brushings were positive for malignant cells. The initial biopsy results revealed clusters of atypical cells with severe crushing effects consistent with SCLS. Immunohistochemistry revealed SCLC with EGFR positive for Exon 21 2573T>G L858R mutation as well as a high proliferative index (ki-67, 80%), and positive TTF-1 and synaptophysin. The patient was diagnosed with EGFR-positive metastatic SCLC and treated with the third-generation TKI, osimertinib. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for less than 15% of the cases of lung cancer. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations are rarely reported in association with SCLC. EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) are approved as the first-line therapy for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
