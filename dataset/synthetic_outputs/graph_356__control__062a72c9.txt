A 71-year-old man diagnosed with advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma and treated with chemotherapy developed ileocecal diverticulitis three times over the last 2 months of receiving second-line treatment. During the fourth diverticulitis event, the patient presented with fever and abdominal pain, worsening after 5 days. Abdominal computed tomography showed ascites and intra-abdominal free air, suggesting bowel perforation with acute diffuse peritonitis. Emergency surgery was performed, and surgical findings showed diverticulosis with perforated diverticula in the ileocecal region. An ileocecal resection, an ileostomy, and a mucous fistula of the ascending colon were performed. Histopathological examinations revealed pseudodiverticula at the perforation, where the mucosa was depressed through the muscularis propria. The patient was diagnosed with perforated ileal diverticulitis.
