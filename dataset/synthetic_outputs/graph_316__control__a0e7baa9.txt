Haemothorax is an accumulation of blood in the pleural space. Retained haemothorax refers to blood that cannot be drained from the pleural cavity and is associated with an increased risk of empyema and fibrothorax often necessitating surgical evacuation. This case series describes the experience of using intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy in three patients with different bleeding risks and acute non-traumatic retained haemothorax.

The first patient was a 41-year-old female with disseminated *Candida guilliermondii* sepsis and an iatrogenic haemothorax. The second patient was a 48-year-old female with transfusion-dependent acute myeloid leukaemia and spontaneous haemothorax. The third patient was a 72-year-old female with spontaneous haemothorax from newly diagnosed lung cancer.

All patients received one to two doses of intrapleural alteplase without any bleeding complications. The treatment resulted in the resolution of retained haemothorax in all three patients. This case series demonstrates the successful application and safety of intrapleural alteplase as an alternative to surgery in a well-resourced environment with close monitoring and ready access to blood transfusion.
