A 65-year-old woman was diagnosed with extensive-disease small cell lung cancer (ED-SCLC). The initial treatment plan involved durvalumab and etoposide. However, during the first course of treatment, specifically on day 1 during an etoposide infusion, the patient experienced anaphylactic shock. Following the administration of durvalumab, etoposide was discontinued due to an anaphylactic reaction immediately after its initiation. The patient was unable to continue the same regimen and was switched to cisplatin and irinotecan therapy. A FoundationOne panel test was submitted, and TMB-high was detected. After four courses of cisplatin and irinotecan therapy, pembrolizumab was introduced, and a complete response (CR) was maintained for 18 months. One week after initiating Pembrolizumab treatment, the patient developed papules and pustules on both palms and soles. This was diagnosed as an exacerbation of the patientâ€™s pre-existing palmoplantar pustulosis. The patient achieved long-term remission lasting over 18 months with pembrolizumab treatment.
