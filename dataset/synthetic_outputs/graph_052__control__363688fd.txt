A patient with HIV presented with an intermittent cough. Initial investigations considered lung cancer with rib and lymph node metastasis. A palpable lump was noted in the right supraclavicular lymph node, accompanied by localized pain. Examination revealed coarse breath sounds in the left lung. Further findings included increased radioactivity and a hypermetabolic lesion in the right tenth rib, indicating bone destruction. The patient also exhibited severe anemia.

Differential diagnoses included infections such as Pasteurella multocida, Epstein-Barr virus, Legionella pneumophila, and Pasteurella pneumotropica infection, as well as pneumonia.

Ultimately, the patient was diagnosed with Talaromycosis, an opportunistic fungal infection caused by Talaromyces marneffei. This diagnosis was delayed. The patient likely contracted the T. marneffei infection by inhaling T. marneffei conidia, possibly through exposure to bamboo rats. The infection affected the monocyte-macrophage system.

The patient received anti-infective treatment, specifically antifungal therapy with amphotericin B and itraconazole. The patient showed a favorable response to the antifungal therapy. T. marneffei infection is associated with a high death rate, particularly in cases with delayed diagnosis.
