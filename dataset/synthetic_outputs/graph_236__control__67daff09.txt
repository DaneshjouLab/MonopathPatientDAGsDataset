Here, we describe an 82-year-old man with non-small cell lung carcinoma complicated by idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) who was treated with nintedanib. Biopsy confirmed non-small cell carcinoma. Because of the risk of acute exacerbation of IPF by chemotherapy, supportive care was selected. Nintedanib was started as treatment for the IPF. After seven months, partial remission of the lung cancer was observed without progression of IPF. Nine months later, HRCT revealed partial remission without exacerbation of IPF. This case indicates the possibility of nintedanib monotherapy in suppressing lung cancer complicated by IPF. We present a case of an elderly patient with non-small cell carcinoma with underlying idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) who was treated with nintedanib. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic progressive lung disease and a risk factor for lung cancer development. However, it remains unclear whether nintedanib is an effective treatment for lung cancer in patients with IPF. Patients with lung cancer complicated by IPF in whom treatment is effective remain unknown. Additional research is needed to identify effective therapy for lung cancer with IPF. This report indicates the possibility that nintedanib monotherapy could suppress lung cancer in patients with IPF.
