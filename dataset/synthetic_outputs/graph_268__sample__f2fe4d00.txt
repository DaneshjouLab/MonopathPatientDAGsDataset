A patient in his seventies was found to have a nodule in his right lung during a routine health examination. Transbronchial biopsy revealed squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). EGFR mutation, ALK translocation, and ROS1 mutations yielded negative results. PD-L1 tumor proportion score was 95%. He was diagnosed with stage IIIA lung SCC.

The patient received concurrent radiation chemotherapy consisting of carboplatin, paclitaxel, and radiation with 60 Gy in 30 fractions. This treatment was followed by maintenance therapy with durvalumab at 2-week intervals.

Six months after completion of first-line chemoradiotherapy, the patient experienced lymph node recurrence and received additional chemotherapy with nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel, carboplatin, and pembrolizumab.

Ten days after the administration of this chemotherapy regimen, he reported severe diarrhea. CT imaging revealed bowel wall thickening. He was diagnosed with grade 3 immune-related colitis (CTCAE).

The colitis was treated with high-dose prednisolone (2mg/kg/day, tapered to lower dosage) and infliximab (5mg/kg).
