A 66-year-old woman with no significant medical history presented with an 18 mm nodule in the S9 region of the right lower lobe, detected on chest CT, raising suspicion for primary lung cancer. A CT-guided lung biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma. Subsequent PET/CT imaging revealed FDG accumulation in the #11i lymph node, suggestive of metastasis, leading to a preoperative staging of c-T1bN1M0 Stage IIB. Preoperative imaging also identified a 9 mm bronchobiliary fistula (BD) communicating with the right main bronchus below the tracheal bifurcation.

The patient underwent planned robotic thoracoscopic surgery, including right lower lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node dissection. During the procedure, lower mediastinal lymph node dissection and bronchobiliary fistula (BD) repair were performed. The bronchobiliary fistula (BD) was ligated with ENDOLOOP® PDS II Ligature. The #11i lymph node was enlarged but without invasion, and frozen pathology showed no lymph node metastasis. Right lower lobectomy was then performed. The bronchobiliary fistula (BD) and lower lobe bronchial stumps were covered with pericardial fat tissue.

The patient was discharged without postoperative complications. Final pathology revealed no lymph node metastases, resulting in a diagnosis of p-T1bN0M0 stage IA2.

Six months post-operation, a chest CT showed no recurrence of lung cancer. However, air was detected in the bronchobiliary fistula (BD), suggesting an opening of the diverticulum. Follow-up CT 6 months after the operation confirmed air in the bronchobiliary fistula (BD), further suggesting an opening of the diverticulum. It was hypothesized that recanalization of the bronchobiliary fistula (BD) may have occurred due to hydrolysis of the absorbable thread (ENDOLOOP® PDS II Ligature) used during the initial ligation.
