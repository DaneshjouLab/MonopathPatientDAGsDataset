A 67-year-old Han Chinese male patient presented with dyspnea and normal body temperature on the 15th day of close contact with his son, who returned from Wuhan. He was diagnosed with advanced non-small cell lung cancer and developed pneumonitis post Sintilimab injection during the COVID-19 pandemic period. The swab samples were taken twice within 72 hours and real-time reverse-transcription polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) results were COVID-19 negative. The anti-PD-1 related pneumonitis mixed with bacterial infection was clinically diagnosed based on the laboratory and radiological evidences and good response to the prednisolone and antibiotics. The patient's case highlights the difficulty in differentiating between COVID-19 pneumonia and anti-PD-1 related pneumonitis, as they possess similar clinical presentations and CT imaging features. Differential diagnosis depends on the epidemiological and immunotherapy histories, and RT-PCR tests. Pneumonitis is a known severe and potentially fatal immune-related adverse event (irAE) associated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatments, characterized by noninfectious focal and diffuse inflammation of lung parenchyma.
