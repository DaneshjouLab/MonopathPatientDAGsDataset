A patient presented with generalized weakness, initially manifesting as muscle weakness and loss of strength in the proximal muscles of both upper and lower limbs. The patient reported difficulties in climbing stairs and walking. Electromyography (EMG) and neurophysiological tests, including repetitive nerve stimulation and single-fibre electromyography, were performed. Anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies were detected. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of Myasthenia Gravis (MG) was considered.

Further investigation revealed the presence of small cell lung carcinoma. The patient was subsequently diagnosed with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with the carcinoma. Malignant cells were found in the mediastinum's lymph nodes. The patient's weakness was attributed to both MG and Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, both affecting the neuromuscular junction and skeletal muscles. The patient experienced respiratory failure. The small cell lung carcinoma was identified as the underlying cause of the paraneoplastic syndromes.
