A 48-year-old male patient with a 14 pack-year smoking history, and no other significant medical history, was admitted with a primary complaint of cough and back pain. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a 77 mm mass in the lower lobe of the right lung with left atrial invasion, enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes (#2R, 4R, #7, and #2L), right hilar lymph nodes, and right pleural effusion. Transbronchial lung biopsy histopathological immunohistochemistry (IHC) revealed TTF-1 positive adenocarcinoma. Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma, cT4N3M1a, stage IVA.

IHC analysis indicated that the tumor cells were positive for ALK antibody (clone D5F3, VENTANA). Molecular analysis revealed an *EML4-ALK* fusion V1 (E13:A20). PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx assay showed high PD-L1 expression with a tumor proportion score (TPS) of 100%. Analysis also revealed that the case was MSI-high, with immunohistochemistry showing the nuclei of the tumor cells were positive for MLH1 and PMS2 but negative for MSH2 and MSH6, indicating MSI status with MSH2 gene disruption.

The patient was initially treated with alectinib at 300 mg twice a day. Two months after starting alectinib, the tumor size decreased. However, five months after alectinib treatment, the patient experienced pain in the left fingertips and was diagnosed with peripheral arterial occlusive disease. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed multiple cerebral infarctions, and laboratory tests demonstrated elevated D-dimer (21.6 Î¼g/ml) levels. CT scan showed left atrial invasion progression. The patient was started on Heparin therapy for cancer-associated thromboembolism. Alectinib was discontinued, and the patient was switched to pembrolizumab IV therapy at 200 mg every three weeks.

Two months after initiating pembrolizumab therapy, the left atrial invasion significantly decreased, and D-dimer levels returned to normal. The patient continued pembrolizumab therapy for a year with no adverse events, and continued tumor shrinkage. Heparin was switched to Apixaban.
