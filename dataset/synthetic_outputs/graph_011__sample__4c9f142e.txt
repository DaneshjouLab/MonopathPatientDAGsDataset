A 65-year-old never-smoker woman with an ECOG performance status of 0 and a history of well-controlled hypertension presented with fatigue and unintentional weight loss of 3 kg. A thoracic CT scan revealed a 45 mm heterogeneous mass, a solitary 11 mm pre-carinal lymphadenopathy, ipsilateral pleural effusion, and multiple millimetric nodules consistent with bilateral metastases. Biopsy confirmed stage IVa (cT4N2M1a, TNM 8th edition) lung adenocarcinoma with acinar and micropapillary patterns. Molecular testing was negative for EGFR, ALK, and ROS1 alterations.

The patient was initiated on first-line systemic therapy with a platinum-based doublet, completing six cycles with a partial tumor response according to RECIST criteria. After six cycles of first-line therapy, a partial tumor response was observed, characterized by a significant reduction in the primary tumor size and near-complete regression of bilateral micronodules. Maintenance therapy with pemetrexed was initiated, with sustained stability.

In November 2020, disease progression was identified with a new growing 11 mm nodule and a 21% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions. A re-biopsy of a paravertebral nodule confirmed adenocarcinoma, with PD-L1 expression of 5%. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) revealed a RET gene fusion.

Cabozantinib was initiated as second-line off-label therapy but was discontinued after one month due to significant adverse effects including severe asthenia, nausea, and thrombocytopenia. Pembrolizumab was initiated as third-line therapy, with stable disease for 10 months. Subsequently, progressive neurological symptoms developed, including bilateral hypoacusis, headache, and dizziness.
