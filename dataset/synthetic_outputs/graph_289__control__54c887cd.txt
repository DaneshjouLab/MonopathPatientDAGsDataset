A 52-year-old female patient presented with a 2-month history of cough and sputum production, which worsened with shortness of breath for 1 month. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan revealed diffuse miliary nodules in both lungs. A CT-guided needle biopsy of the left lung led to a diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma with an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 21 L858R mutation. The patient was treated with gefitinib 250 mg per day. Follow-up chest CT scans showed a reduction in the double lung nodules, and the patient's symptoms improved.

A retrospective analysis was conducted on this case of lung adenocarcinoma with miliary metastasis in both lungs, along with a literature review of similar cases. A search of databases (Wanfang, CNKI, and PubMed) identified 7 relevant Chinese articles and 56 English articles, reporting a total of 16 cases. Combining the present case, a total of 17 cases were analyzed. Among these 17 patients with lung adenocarcinoma, 2 did not have EGFR gene mutation status reported. Of the 15 cases with EGFR testing, 1 patient had no mutation, 10 had EGFR exon 19 deletions, 1 was ALK positive, 1 had the EGFR exon 21 L858R mutation (like the index patient), and 2 had EGFR exon 20 insertions.

This case highlights the rare clinical presentation of lung adenocarcinoma with miliary metastasis in both lungs, a subtype that is easily misdiagnosed. This subtype of adenocarcinoma often has EGFR mutations, making EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) the preferred treatment option.
