A 50-year-old Asian male presented on November 17, 2020, with a month-long history of blood-tainted sputum and dull chest and back pain. CT and PET-CT scans revealed a potentially malignant nodule (27 mm × 17 mm × 21 mm) in the anterior segment of the left upper lung lobe, along with pleural metastasis. A biopsy confirmed adenocarcinoma of the lung with an elevated CEA level of 53.28 ng/mL. Tumor carried the EGFRp. L858R mutation confirmed by DNA next-generation sequencing (NGS) of plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA). The patient was started on oral osimertinib therapy, leading to symptom resolution and sustained shrinkage. A follow-up PET-CT scan on May 1, 2023, showed tumor enlargement (13 mm × 12 mm × 17 mm). The patient underwent wedge resection on May 7, 2023, with removal of nodular pleural thickening. Pathology revealed a 15 mm × 14 mm × 13 mm moderately differentiated tumor consisting of acinar adenocarcinoma (70%), papillary adenocarcinoma (25%), and micropapillary adenocarcinoma (5%). Lymph node metastasis was positive, and tumor cell infiltration into the pleura was surgically removed. No vessel carcinoma embolus or neural or pleural invasion was observed. NGS of the tumor specimen indicated EGFRp.L858R mutation.
