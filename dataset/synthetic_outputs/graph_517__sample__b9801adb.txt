A 53-year-old female presented with pain and pitting edema of the left lower extremity, with symptom onset approximately 6 months prior to hospitalization. Color Doppler ultrasonography revealed a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the popliteal vein. The patient was treated with heparin at 1100 U/hour, followed by discharge on warfarin 5 mg daily, achieving an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.2 after pain relief.

One month later, the patient returned with a subdural hematoma in the hemisphere, causing mass effect to the lateral ventricle and subfalcine herniation, as revealed by cerebral computed tomography (CT) scan. Anticoagulant therapy was stopped, and the patient underwent a craniotomy.

One month after the craniotomy, the patient returned with pain and swelling of the right leg, anorexia, and a weight loss of 4 kg over the last 4 months. Her body temperature was 36.5Â°C, and blood pressure was 120/80 mm Hg. Heart rate was 78 beats per minute, and respiratory rate was 14 breaths per minute. Heart and lung auscultation were normal. Mild epigastric tenderness without rebound was noted. A difference of approximately 4 cm was observed between distal and proximal circumferences of the right and left lower extremities.
