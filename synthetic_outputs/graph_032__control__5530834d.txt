A patient presented with chest pain, recurrent cough, expectoration, angina, and retrosternal pain described as a burning sensation. Initial investigations included an Electrocardiogram, Chest CT, Dual-source CT, and coronary CT angiography. These tests revealed potential cardiac ischemia and the patient was subsequently diagnosed with coronary heart disease and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Coronary angiography confirmed stenosis, leading to percutaneous coronary intervention with stent placement.

Further investigation, possibly prompted by the recurrent cough and expectoration, revealed a peripheral lung cancer. A fine-needle aspiration confirmed lung adenocarcinoma. Genetic testing and immunoassay were performed to characterize the tumor. Positron emission tomography and bone scan revealed bone metastases, indicating advanced disease.

The patient was treated with bisphosphonates for anti-osteolysis and pain relief related to the bone metastases. Immunotherapy and radiotherapy were also initiated as part of the lung cancer treatment. The patient also had a history of pulmonary emphysema, interstitial lung disease, and herpes zoster. Aortic dissection and hypoxia were also considered in the differential diagnosis. The patient's overall condition was complicated by cardiovascular disease and the presence of a malignant tumor.
