A 49-year-old male presented with a cough that had been worsening over two weeks. The cough became persistent and productive of yellow sputum with occasional hemoptysis. He also reported intermittent right-sided chest pain. He denied shortness of breath, fever, and weight loss. He had no history of cigarette smoking.

Four days prior to presentation, the patient underwent a chest X-ray, which showed a well-circumscribed lobulated mass within the posteromedial right upper lobe of the lung.

Subsequently, a CT scan revealed a 6.6x6.0x5.9 cm solid, heterogeneous mass in the superior right upper lobe, obliterating the right upper bronchus and abutting the pleura. The CT scan also identified two solid 4 mm left upper lobe pulmonary nodules, a 5.3x4.1 cm paratracheal lymph node, and generalized mediastinal lymphadenopathy.

A PET scan demonstrated abnormal FDG uptake in the right upper lobe mass, as well as in the right upper and lower paratracheal regions, and the right suprahilar region.

The patient then underwent mediastinoscopy with paratracheal lymph node biopsy. Histological examination of the biopsy revealed cells with large nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and fairly scant cytoplasm. The tumor possessed a solid architecture with areas of discohesion and necrosis.

Immunohistochemical (IHC) markers were performed. The results were negative, except for positive trace TTF-1 and cytokeratin. The markers were negative for Claudin-4 and Napsin.
