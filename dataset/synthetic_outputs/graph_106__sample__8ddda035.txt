A 54-year-old non-smoking woman with a medical history notable for hypertension presented with an abnormal shadow on a chest x-ray during an annual check-up. This led to a diagnosis of lung cancer by trans bronchial brushing cytology. Subsequently, the patient underwent a right middle lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node dissection. Surgical pathology revealed a tumour measuring 19 \u00d7 19 \u00d7 22 mm, identified as a pT1bN1M0 papillary adenocarcinoma with hilar lymph node involvement. Single gene analysis of the resected tumour showed an EGFR exon 19 deletion but was negative for BRAF V600E. Following surgery, the patient underwent four courses of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin and vinorelbine. One year and nine months after the surgery, multiple intrapulmonary metastases were identified in both lungs. Molecularly targeted therapy using osimertinib was initiated, considering the presence of the EGFR exon 19 deletion. Three years and two months after the surgery, all intrapulmonary metastases had disappeared or shrunk. Four years after the surgery, a nodule at the superior segment (S6) of the left lung enlarged from 6 mm to 11 mm.
