A 48-year-old non-smoking man presented with clinical stage IVB (cT1bN0M1c) lung adenocarcinoma harboring an *EGFR* L858R mutation. He also had diffuse bone metastases in the trunk and proximal limbs, and cancerous pleurisy. Initial laboratory tests revealed a corrected calcium level of 8.3 mg/dL, urinary calcium level of 7.3 mg/dL, and ALP level of 1353 U/L, with normal renal function.

The patient was started on gefitinib 250 mg/d as first-line treatment. Two days later, denosumab (120 mg) was administered to prevent skeletal-related events (SREs), along with daily supplementation of two combination tablets of precipitated calcium carbonate (610 mg calcium), cholecalciferol (400 IU vitamin D), and magnesium carbonate (30 mg calcium).

Three days after denosumab administration, the patient developed tetany and QT prolongation (QTc, 500 ms) due to denosumab-induced hypocalcemia, confirmed by a corrected serum calcium level of 5.6 mg/dL and urinary calcium level of 0.4 mg/dL.

On day 4, treatment with alfacalcidol (3 μg/d) and calcium gluconate hydrate (initial intravenous injection of 7.8 mEq, followed by intravenous infusion of 93.6 mEq/d) was initiated. The corrected serum calcium levels improved, but the urinary calcium level remained low for several weeks. Oral calcium lactate (15 g/d) was added to the alfacalcidol (4 μg/d) regimen. The intravenous calcium gluconate was gradually reduced, and by day 61, the treatment was adjusted to 11.7 mEq three times a week, maintaining the corrected serum calcium level. This treatment was continued at the outpatient clinic after discharge.

On day 129 after denosumab administration, hypocalcemia treatment was discontinued based on corrected serum and urinary calcium levels. The patient continued gefitinib treatment and achieved a partial response. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-5b (TRACP-5b), a bone resorption marker, was measured on day 66 and found to gradually increase. Elevated serum and urinary calcium levels were observed after the increase in TRACP-5b. TRACP-5b had a predictive value for improving calcium levels and supported drug adjustments for calcium levels.
