A 62-year-old man was diagnosed in 2020 with T2N3M1b adenocarcinoma subtype NSCLC, *KRAS* G12C mutant, and programmed death-ligand 1 positive at 2%. He had no relevant previous comorbidities, no previous history of liver disease, hepatitis, or alcohol abuse, and was positive for having cytomegalovirus immunoglobulin G. He was initially treated with carboplatin-pemetrexed-pembrolizumab, with mediastinal progression after cycle 1 of maintenance pembrolizumab-pemetrexed, for which he received palliative thoracic radiotherapy (20 Gy in 5 fractions). CPI therapy had caused no previous hepatotoxicity and no immune-related AEs worse than grade 1. He commenced second-line sotorasib, 960 mg once daily, on compassionate supply prelicense in March 2021, 14 weeks after the last dose of pembrolizumab, having discussed risks and alternatives. Baseline liver function tests before commencing sotorasib were within the reference range. On cycle 1 day 12, he had grade 2 alkaline phosphatase (ALP), grade 1 bilirubin, and grade 3 ALT rise. Sotorasib was held. His bilirubin, ALT, and ALP worsened rapidly in subsequent days, requiring commencement of 60 mg oral prednisolone on day 15 and hospitalization. Investigations including liver ultrasonography, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, and comprehensive acute viral serologic and molecular testing identified no other hepatotoxicity causes, including extensive testing for hepatitis A/B/C/E and a broad autoimmune antibody panel. Other than a positive Epstein–Barr virus immunoglobulin G and detection at low-level with polymerase chain reaction (346 IU/mL), considered noncontributory to this extreme hepatitis picture, no other notable inciting factors were present in the clinical and pharmacologic history or identified through investigations. Liver function continued to deteriorate. He was empirically treated for presumed immunotherapy-related hepatitis with 2 mg/kg intravenous methylprednisolone at day 19 and N-acetylcysteine support. At peak, his ALT reached 23.9 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) (ALT = 1722 U/liter, grade 4, d 23), 10.5 times the ULN ALP (1326 U/liter, grade 3, d 21), 9.3 times the ULN bilirubin (205 μmol/liter, grade 3, d 24), and 29.2 times the ULN gamma-glutamyl transferase (2131 U/liter, grade 4). Coagulation was not markedly deranged throughout (peak international normalized ratio = 1.2), and he did not develop encephalopathy. Ultrasound-guided liver biopsy (d 21) result identified portal and lobular inflammatory changes in a pattern typical of CPI hepatitis on expert review. There was evidence of marked hepatocyte regeneration and significant cholestasis. Liver function tests improved by day 31, and a gradual steroid wean was initiated with ALT resolving to grade 1 by day 35. This was the first reported case of life-threatening hepatitis in a patient with NSCLC shortly after commencing sotorasib, in which biopsy result was consistent with checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) immune-related adverse event, implicating sotorasib as being able to trigger CPI immune hepatitis.
