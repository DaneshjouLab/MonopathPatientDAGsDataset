A 77-year-old man with a history of past smoking, hypertension, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and hyperuricemia was admitted for his first cycle of chemotherapy for stage IV small cell lung cancer without cerebral metastases. Thirty minutes after receiving premedication with 4 mg intravenous ondansetron and 8 mg intravenous dexamethasone, the patient experienced a sudden change in mental status, progressing to somnolence. Physical examination revealed altered mental status and right-sided weakness, while hemodynamic and respiratory stability were maintained.

The patient was responsive to painful stimuli, localizing pain with both extremities but exhibiting reduced mobility on the right side, accompanied by right facial paresis. Plantar reflexes were bilaterally flexor. Eyes were positioned at the midline; the left pupil was irregular (possibly due to prior surgery), while the right pupil was miotic and reactive to light. An electrocardiogram revealed sinus bradycardia with a first-degree atrioventricular block.

Blood gas analysis showed no respiratory, metabolic, or electrolyte abnormalities. Brain CT angiography did not reveal any vascular lesions or thrombi in major vessels. Cerebral vessels reconstruction of computed tomography angiography was performed after the first event.

Approximately one hour after the onset of symptoms, the patient gradually became more alert, and by one hour and thirty minutes after onset, he had returned to his baseline mental status without any neurological deficits. Due to the suspicion of a transient ischemic event as the primary cause of the symptoms, a loading dose of 300 mg of aspirin was administered, followed by a daily dose of 100 mg of aspirin.
