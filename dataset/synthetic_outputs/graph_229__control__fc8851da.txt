A 50-year-old female presented with pulmonary and neurological symptoms. She was initially diagnosed with disseminated tuberculosis and started on antitubercular therapy. Despite initial improvements, daily bedside evaluations revealed a new cervical lymph node. Further investigation of the lymph node revealed features suggestive of malignancy. A biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the lung with cerebral metastases. The patient was started on palliative chemotherapy but eventually succumbed due to complications.
