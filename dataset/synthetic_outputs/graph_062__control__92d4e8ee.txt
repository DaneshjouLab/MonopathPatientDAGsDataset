A 38-year-old man was diagnosed with right PLELC. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a mass in the medial segment of the middle lobe of the right lung, with lymph node metastasis in the mediastinum and right hilum of the lung. CT-guided lung tumor biopsy was performed and the postoperative pathological examination combined with immune phenotype analysis and in situ hybridization confirmed PLELC. Standard molecular testing for patients with non-small cell lung cancer was negative and programmed cell death ligand-1 expression was about 2%. The patient declined radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Consequently, immunotherapy was administered, which included toripalimab 240 mg on day 1 and anlotinib 10 mg on days 1-14 for 10 cycles, followed by a maintenance dose of anlotinib 10 mg daily every 3 weeks. As a result, his progression-free survival reached 48 months.
