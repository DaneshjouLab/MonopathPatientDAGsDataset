In October 2020, a 47-year-old woman presented with an elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level of 14.18 ug/L. Gastrointestinal endoscopy was negative. Three months later, a chest CT revealed a 26.7 mm x 24.1 mm solid nodule in the right upper lobe. Approximately five months later, on June 7th 2021, a follow-up chest CT showed a 36.7 mm x 34.1 mm mass in the right upper lobe with irregular shape, lobulation, spiculation, pleural indentation, and vessel convergence. Enhanced contrast CT showed slight enlargement of station 4R lymph node with a 10 mm short axis. Further workup included lab tests and imaging. CEA was 26.96 ug/L, squamous cell carcinoma antigen was 1.98 ng/mL, CYFRA 21-1 was 3.12 ng/mL, and pro-gastric releasing peptide was 65 ng/L. PET-CT showed a 40 mm x 39 mm x 34 mm mass highly suspected of lung cancer with SUV 14.6. Swollen mediastinal lymph nodes 3A and 4R had high uptake (SUV max = 4.5). Brain MRI and bone scan were negative. CT guided pulmonary biopsy showed poorly differentiated lung adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrinization. The patient subsequently received a right upper lobectomy with systemic lymph node dissection.
