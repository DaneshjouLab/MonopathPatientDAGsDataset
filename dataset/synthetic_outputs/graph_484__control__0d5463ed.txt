A 54-year-old immunocompetent patient presented with pulmonary cryptococcosis (PC) and lung adenocarcinoma. Chest CT revealed multiple nodules in the right lung, with the largest nodule located in the dorsal segment of the right lower lobe. 18Fâ€‘FDG positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) revealed elevated glucose metabolism in the dorsal segment of the right lower lobe, suggesting lung cancer. The metabolism level of the nodule in the basal segment of the right lower lobe and the anterior segment of the right upper lobe was not abnormally increased, but the possibility of a malignant tumour could not be excluded. The pulmonary nodules in the dorsal segment and the basal segment of the right lower lobe were simultaneously resected via video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS), and the final histopathology revealed primary lung adenocarcinoma and pulmonary cryptococcal infection, respectively. After surgery, antifungal treatment was administered for 3 months. Over the 3-year follow-up, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed no recurrence of either disease.
