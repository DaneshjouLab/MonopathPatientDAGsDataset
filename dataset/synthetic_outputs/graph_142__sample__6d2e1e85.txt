In August 2019, a 56-year-old male with an occasional smoking history presented with a 2-week history of cough and sputum, and a 4-day history of shortness of breath. The patient's cough, sputum, and shortness of breath led to a contrast-enhanced CT scan. The CT scan revealed an 8.0 cm Ã— 6.9 cm mass in the lower lobe of the right lung, with multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules, hilum of right lung and mediastinal lymph node metastasis, and right-sided pleural effusion. CT scan findings prompted a right lung biopsy. Right lung biopsy showed invasive lung adenocarcinoma. EGFR mutation and ALK tests showed negative results. Biopsy results and PD-L1 testing led to a diagnosis and staging. PD-L1 expression was negative after immunohistochemical (IHC) assay. The patient was diagnosed with right lung adenocarcinoma (T4N2M1a, stage III), with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 1. Baseline chest CT showing a lung mass in the right lower lobe. Diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma led to the initiation of first-line chemotherapy with pemetrexed (850mg) plus nidaplatin (140\u2009mg). The patient received 6 cycles of platinum-based doublets and 1 cycle of pemetrexed disodium maintenance therapy and experienced disease progression (PD), with a progression-free survival (PFS) of 5 months. Disease progression after first-line therapy prompted a switch to second-line therapy with nivolumab (200\u2009mg, PFS, 2 months). Chest CT before second-line nivolumab. Nivolumab was given as a second-line therapy, but the patient progressed after 2 months. Third-line therapy was then started with nanoparticle albumin bound paclitaxel (450mg) plus anlotinib (12mg daily, PFS, 11.5 months). Patient had a partial response at 4 months after third-line therapy. Chest CT at disease progression. In April 2021, the patient began to have headaches and dizziness. New symptoms of headaches and dizziness prompted further imaging. Baseline chest CT and brain MRI before crizotinib. Headaches and dizziness led to brain MRI, revealing multiple brain metastases. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed multiple brain metastases. Partial response of all lung lesions and brain lesions after 2 months of crizotinib, but new liver lesions. Partial response of lung and brain lesions, but new liver lesions, led to consideration of entrectinib. Chest CT and brain MRI before entrectinib showing partial response and brain lesions progression.
