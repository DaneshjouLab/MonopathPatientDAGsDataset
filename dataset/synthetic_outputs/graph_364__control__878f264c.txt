A 57-year-old woman presented on October 4, 2022, with “coughing discomfort for half a month and a 2-day history of right lung occupancy.” She had been admitted to the hospital half a month prior with a cough, dry cough, and low-grade fever. Anti-infective treatment at a local hospital was ineffective. A chest CT scan revealed solid nodules in the upper lobe of the right lung (22 × 15 mm), suggestive of a tumor lesion, and multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum and right hilum (the largest being 3.4 cm in diameter), raising concerns for metastasis. A subsequent chest CT with contrast showed a solid nodule in the anterior segment of the upper lobe of the right lung, measuring approximately 22 × 15 mm, with ring-shaped enhancement, further supporting the suspicion of a malignant tumor lesion. A pure ground-glass nodule was also identified in the lateral segment of the middle lobe of the right lung, measuring about 14 × 10 mm, with adjacent pleural stretching, and a tumor lesion could not be excluded. The enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum and right hilum also exhibited ring-shaped enhancement, consistent with metastasis. The patient was ultimately diagnosed with Pulmonary mucoepidermoid carcinoma (PMEC), a rare primary lung cancer, in combination with an ALK mutation. PMEC combined with ALK mutation is an extremely rare primary lung cancer, and the diagnosis is mainly based on pathology, histology and immunohistochemistry. After treatment, the patient’s cough and fever were controlled, her diet improved significantly, and she gained 20 pounds in 6 months.
