Patients with lung cancer (LC) are at significantly higher risk of developing venous thromboembolism (VTE), which may lead to increased use of health resources and the cost of the disease management. VTE, including pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT), constitutes a major health problem. Cancer-associated VTE (CAT) occurs in 4–20% of cancer patients and is associated with elderly age at diagnosis, increase of cancer prevalence, advances in the diagnosis of incidental VTE, and anti-tumoral drugs with thrombotic properties.

In a study, more than half of patients (55.3%) had PE, and 44.7% had DVT. Pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis were the two principal causes for hospitalizations, in 65.2%, and 21.7% of the patients, respectively. Pulmonary embolism represents a pooled incidence of 3.7% in lung cancer patients.

The main cost driver was in hospital stays, especially for those patients who suffer from PE. The decision to admit PE patients in hospital is based on some prognostic scales in the general population, such as Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI) (or simplified version, sPESI) to predict 30-day mortality based on easily determinable clinical findings (age, cancer history, history of chronic cardiovascular disease, heart rate ≥110, systolic blood pressure <100 mm Hg, oxygen Saturation <90%).

The main clinical practice guidelines recognize LMWH as the standard treatment of care for CAT. Clinicians who treat CAT should be aware that this event is not merely a complication but has a broader impact on the patient’s quality of life. Early prevention, diagnosis and treatment of CAT can save lives. The direct cost of CAT is €10,969.6 per patient and semester. Choosing optimal treatment option with LMWH could be considered as an optimal strategy to significantly reduce the direct cost in cancer associated thrombosis.

Although the pathogenesis of thromboembolic events in cancer is likely multifactorial, chemotherapy and immobilization are considered two of the risk factors to develop thromboembolic events.
