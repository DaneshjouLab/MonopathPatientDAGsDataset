A patient was diagnosed with left lung adenocarcinoma with hilar mediastinal lymph node, left supraspinal lymph node, and extensive bone metastases (cT4N3M1c, stage IVB). The patient initially experienced stable disease for a period of eight months. Subsequently, new brain lesions developed in October 2020 after a 10-month period of stability. However, the patient’s brain lesions continued to deteriorate by February 2021. Both brain and lung lesions remained stable for a duration of eight months. After developing resistance to afatinib, the patient exhibited disease progression in the brain lesions in November 2021, leading to the fourth-line almonertinib (220 mg daily [qd] by mouth [po]). After three months, the patient’s brain lesions showed increased progression in February 2022, prompting the initiation of fifth-line afatinib combined with pemetrexed. The combination therapy resulted in stable disease (SD) and progression-free survival (PFS) of up to 21 months. In November 2023, the patient developed multiple metastases in the chest wall, lungs, liver, and brain. Subsequently, a biopsy of a mass in the left chest wall confirmed the involvement of lung adenocarcinoma based on the pathological findings. After two months of treatment, the patient exhibited a significant reduction in the size of lung, brain, and liver metastases compared with their previous dimensions in January 2024. The lesions continued to show partial response (PR) in June 2024. During combination therapy, the patient exhibited only grade 1 transaminase elevations, which improved with hepatoprotective treatment. To date, the patient has achieved an overall survival (OS) of more than 60 months, with sustained clinical benefit and stable disease.
