A patient presented with pulmonary adenocarcinoma, which subsequently metastasized to the lungs. The patient also had a history of thyroid nodules that developed into a rapidly growing thyroid tumor. This tumor was diagnosed as anaplastic thyroid carcinoma. The patient experienced neck pain, tracheal deviation, and cervical lymphadenopathy related to the thyroid tumor.

The patient was initially treated with nivolumab, a PD-1 inhibitor, for the pulmonary adenocarcinoma and pulmonary metastasis. However, the anaplastic thyroid carcinoma progressed. The patient was then treated with lenvatinib for the thyroid cancer.

The patient's lung cancer was further characterized as both NSCLC and SCLC. The patient also had squamous cell lung cancer. The patient received PD-1 therapy.
