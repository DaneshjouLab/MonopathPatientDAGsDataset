A 58-year-old male patient with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), specifically lung squamous cell carcinoma, without a history of hypertension, developed aortic dissection while receiving anlotinib as a third-line treatment. The relationship between anlotinib and aortic dissection had not been previously reported. Before treatment with anlotinib, CT scans showed no signs of aortic dissection, thoracic aortic aneurysm, or dilatation of the aortic root. Emergency computed tomographic angiography revealed aortic dissection (DeBakey type IIIb) and thrombosis of the distal false lumen. The patient was treated with nitroglycerin as antihypertensive medication and underwent stent-graft intervention for the aortic dissection. This case represents the first report of aortic dissection potentially related to anlotinib treatment in advanced lung cancer. The case highlights the potential cardiotoxicity of anlotinib.
