A 67-year-old male with a history of heavy smoking, followed for 6 months for cutaneous nodules on the scalp, presented with weight loss, anorexia, loss of appetite, tiredness, hoarse voice, and respiratory symptoms. Clinical examination revealed multiple ulcerant cutaneous nodules, measuring 1â€“5 cm in diameter, in the parietal and left temporal region with no signs of infection. An excision of a scalp skin lesion was performed. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry revealed adenocarcinoma, likely of pulmonary origin. This prompted further investigation with a PET/CT scan, which revealed a hot nodule in the right lung, right hilar, left carotid jugular lymphadenopathy, left adrenal mass, and three cutaneous nodule metastases in parietal and temporal bone. A biopsy of the right lung lesion confirmed adenocarcinoma, establishing a primary lung malignancy. A subsequent PET/CT showed several abnormal hypermetabolic lesions in the scalp (SUV max = 12.3) and focal uptake in the right lung (SUV max = 11.0). The patient underwent chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide. Despite treatment, the disease progressed with an increase in extensive skin lesions and a pathological fracture in the right femoral collar, which was operated on with a total hip prosthesis. After the third cycle of chemotherapy, the scalp metastases increased in number and extended.
