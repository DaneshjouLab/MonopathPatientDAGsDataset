<h1>Corneal ulcer development due to sintilimab-anlotinib combination therapy-induced dry eye: a case report</h1>

To our knowledge, this is the first case report describing corneal ulcers secondary to dry eye in a patient treated with the combination of PD-1 inhibitor sintilimab and multi-targeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) anlotinib.

A 65-year-old woman with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and bone metastases, without pre-existing ocular conditions, experienced mild dry eye symptoms 1 month following treatment with sintilimab (200 mg q3w) in combination with anlotinib (12 mg q3w). Unrelieved dry eye symptoms occurred after the third cycle of chemotherapy, and she was diagnosed with dry eye syndrome. Her corneal epithelial damage did not improve significantly, and within the following 2 months, her vision decreased in both eyes and progressed to bilateral corneal ulcers. Oral administration of sintilimab and anlotinib was interrupted, and treatments such as corticosteroids, anti-inflammatory drugs, and corneal repair were administered; however, both eyes presented with corneal subepithelial defect and corneal scarring.

This is the first case report of a corneal ulcer caused by programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) inhibitor sintilimab combined with multi-targeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor anlotinib. Anlotinib may destabilize the internal environment of the ocular surface, resulting in lack/imbalance of tear film growth factors, delayed healing of corneal cells, dry eye, and ultimately lead to corneal ulcer. As they increase the immune response, PD-1 inhibitors can act on other normal cells on the ocular surface, causing dry eye syndrome, indirectly or directly damaging corneal epithelial cells, and resulting in corneal ulcers. The development of corneal epithelial disorders in patients receiving target therapy and immunotherapy may not be reversed by reducing its dose.

Ophthalmologists should be aware of eye side effects in patients using immunotherapy to ensure appropriate treatment and minimize potential eye complications such as dry eye and conjunctivitis.
