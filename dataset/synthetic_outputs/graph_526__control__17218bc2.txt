A patient treated with pemetrexed and pembrolizumab developed immune-related pneumonitis and colitis. The patient also experienced hepatic dysfunction, characterized by elevated serum bilirubin and transaminase levels. A liver biopsy, along with negative results for other potential causes like viral infection, led to a diagnosis of immune-related hepatitis.

The patient was treated with steroids for the immune-related hepatitis; however, the hepatic dysfunction did not resolve. When the prednisolone dose was reduced to 15 mg/day, the patient developed hepatic dysfunction and was referred to the department on day 44 after the last dose of pembrolizumab. The patient did not respond to steroids for immune-related hepatitis and subsequently developed infectious enteritis due to a compromised state. The patient died of sepsis on day 107 after the diagnosis of immune-related hepatitis.

According to the manufacturer, the most frequent immune-related adverse events (irAEs) are hepatic dysfunction (all grades, 31.8%), thyroid dysfunction (27.6%), neuropathy (11.1%), and diarrhea (8.7%). This report presents a case of hepatitis induced by pembrolizumab combination chemotherapy, which was treated with steroids and multiple immunosuppressive agents.
