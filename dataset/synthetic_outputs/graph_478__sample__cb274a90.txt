A 53-year-old woman with a 35 pack-year smoking history developed progressive mid-back pain. This led to imaging, which revealed a paraspinal mass, multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules, and a dominant 1.7-cm right lower lobe mass. A biopsy performed on the lung mass revealed adenocarcinoma consistent with lung primary, harboring a KRAS G12C mutation. Treatment was initiated for the adenocarcinoma of the lung with combination ipilimumab 1 mg/kg IV every 6 weeks and nivolumab 3 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks, and the patient was transitioned to nivolumab 480 mg IV every 4 weeks as consolidation therapy after 28 months. Four months after initiating ipilimumab and nivolumab therapy, the patient developed weakness, fatigue, and orthostatic hypotension. Laboratory assessment was performed to investigate these symptoms and revealed low serum concentrations of adrenocorticotropic hormone (<5 pg/mL) and cortisol (0.8 \u03bc/dL). The patient was diagnosed with hypophysitis featuring secondary adrenal insufficiency and was treated with hydrocortisone. 21 months after the hypophysitis diagnosis, the patient experienced a rise in multiple autoantibody levels, including antivitronectin, anti\u2010\u03b22 glycoprotein, antiprothrombin, antiangiotensin receptor 2 type 1, and anti\u2010double-stranded DNA, weeks before the emergence of Raynaud's phenomenon.
