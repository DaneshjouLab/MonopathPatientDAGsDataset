A 67-year-old male with a 25-pack-year smoking history presented with left focal motor seizure and expressive aphasia. Patient's condition progressed, and brain MRI was performed, demonstrating innumerable supra- and infratentorial peripheral enhancing lesions with edema, suggesting intracranial metastases. Further investigation with PET-CT to identify the primary cancer source revealed a hypermetabolic left lung mass and mediastinal and supraclavicular lymph nodes compatible with lung cancer. Lung mass biopsy and further molecular testing were performed. Endobronchial biopsy of the lung mass revealed adenocarcinoma. PDL1 IHC (22C3) was 100%. IHC testing for HER2 expression was 2+. FISH testing demonstrated HER2 amplification with an average HER2 copy number of > 4.0 signals per cell. Next-generation DNA-based sequencing testing later revealed a HER2 exon20 insertion, reported as “ERBB2 Y772_A775dup”. The patient had received prior platinum chemotherapy. Treatment was initiated with pembrolizumab based on PD-L1 expression, followed by WBRT recommendation. However, follow-up brain MRI identified significantly increased size and number (> 60) of brain metastases. Pembrolizumab was discontinued after 1 cycle. Treatment was changed to T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg and bevacizumab 7.5 mg/kg due to disease progression and symptomatic corticosteroid-dependent cerebral edema. Repeat MRI brain 6 weeks after T-DXd revealed remarkable improvement in cerebral edema and metastases. Repeat CT chest revealed a decrease in size of the previously noted spiculated left lower lung mass.
