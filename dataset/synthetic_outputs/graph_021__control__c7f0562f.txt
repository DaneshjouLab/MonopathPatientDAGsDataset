People living with HIV (PLWH) who experience low-level viremia (LLV) face unique challenges in disease management, particularly when diagnosed with concurrent malignancies. Albuvirtide (ABT), a long-acting HIV fusion inhibitor approved in China, has shown promise in clinical trials for treatment-experienced individuals. However, its efficacy in managing LLV in the context of concurrent malignancies remains under-explored.

This report describes two cases of PLWH with LLV who developed non-AIDS-defining cancers (NADCs). The first individual developed lung squamous cell carcinoma, and the second was diagnosed with breast cancer. Both patients received ABT as part of their optimized antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen during their cancer treatment course. After treatment optimization, both cases achieved viral suppression (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL) with improvements in CD4+ T cell counts. Both patients received appropriate cancer treatments according to clinical practice guidelines. The patient diagnosed with lung cancer required an adjustment to his PD-1 inhibitor monotherapy due to intolerance to chemotherapy, whereas the breast cancer patient successfully completed her planned multimodal treatment regimen.

These cases suggest potential benefits of ABT-containing ART regimens in PLWH who have LLV and concurrent NADCs. While two cases cannot establish definitive conclusions, they highlight the need for larger studies investigating the role of ABT in this complex clinical scenario.
