In September 2019, a 74-year-old female patient presented with shortness of breath, cough, and hemoptysis. Bronchoscopic lung biopsy revealed stage IVa (cT4N2M1a) lung adenocarcinoma in the right upper lobe, with multiple ipsilateral lung metastases, and involvement of the pleura and mediastinal lymph nodes. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) identified epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) p.L858R and TP53 p.R248L mutations. This patient had stage IVa epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)L858R-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and experienced disease progression following multiple lines of EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy.

On October 11, 2019, the patient was administered first-line therapy with icotinib (125 mg orally, three times daily), pemetrexed, cisplatin (500 mg/m2 IV, on day 1 of a 21-day cycle), and nedaplatin (80 mg/m2 IV, on day 1 of a 21-day cycle). After 2 months, radiologic partial response (PR) was observed. Following six cycles of treatment, disease progression was observed. Repeat NGS did not reveal any new genetic mutations.

On April 28, 2020, the patient commenced second-line treatment with amonertinib (110 mg orally, once daily) in combination with anlotinib (12 mg orally, once daily for 2 weeks, followed by a 1-week drug-free period, with each cycle lasting 3 weeks) for 3 months. CT scans at the sixth week indicated stable disease (SD). Disease progression was observed after 3 months of amonertinib and anlotinib treatment. Whole-body PET-CT, cranial MRI, and tumor re-biopsy were performed. Disease persisted at stage IVa (cT4N2M1a) without evidence of extra-thoracic metastases. EGFR T790M mutation was identified via NGS.

On August 3, 2020, treatment was initiated with osimertinib (80 mg orally, once daily) and bevacizumab (350 mg IV, on day 1 of a 21-day cycle). Disease progression was observed 2 months after osimertinib and bevacizumab initiation.

On October 10, 2020, pembrolizumab (200 mg IV on day 1 of a 3-week cycle) with pemetrexed (500 mg/m2IV on day 1 of a 3-week cycle) and carboplatin (AUC (5 mg/mL\u00b7min) \u00d7 (creatinine clearance + 25), IV on day 1 of a 3-week cycle) was initiated. A chest CT scan after two cycles of pembrolizumab, pemetrexed, and carboplatin indicated partial response (PR) with significant reduction in multiple tumor lesions and mediastinal lymph nodes. After four cycles of pembrolizumab, pemetrexed, and carboplatin, a PET-CT scan showed significant reduction in multiple tumor lesions, disappearance of certain cavities, and marked attenuation in glucose metabolism compared to the initial assessment in August 2020.

The patient achieved a pathological complete response (pCR) and prolonged survival. Tumor microenvironment analysis showed high programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression on tumor cells and increased infiltration of immune cells, particularly PD-1+CD8+T cells and PD-L1+macrophages.
