An 88-year-old man presented to urgent care in May 2023 with a productive cough with clear phlegm, mostly at night and occasionally postprandial, pleuritic chest pain, and dyspnea on exertion. The patient had a history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension and was a lifelong nonsmoker. A chest X-ray revealed a left lower lobe consolidation, and the patient was treated with oral antibiotics for 10 days for presumed pneumonia.

Two days after completing the antibiotic treatment, the patient's symptoms of productive cough with clear phlegm persisted. CT imaging showed a dense consolidation with a cavitary lesion in the left lower lobe. The patient received a second course of antibiotics for presumed pneumonia for 14 days.

The patient was then admitted to the hospital for treatment of left lower lobe pneumonia with intravenous antibiotics. Differential diagnoses included tuberculosis and aspiration pneumonia with abscess formation. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage was performed, and cultures, including mycobacterial cultures for tuberculosis, were negative.

The patient's cough, dyspnea, and chest pain improved, and he was discharged with prolonged oral antibiotics for one month for presumed aspiration pneumonia with abscess formation.

One week after discharge, the patientâ€™s cough recurred and was productive with clear phlegm. The patient was readmitted to the hospital for further evaluation.
