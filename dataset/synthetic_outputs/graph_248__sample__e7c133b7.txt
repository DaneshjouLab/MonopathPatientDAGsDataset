A 53-year-old patient, diagnosed earlier that year with a suspected malignant tumor of the right superior pulmonary lobe, underwent a PET-CT scan to screen for metastasis.  The scan incidentally revealed an unknown cardiac mass close to the heart. The PET-CT scan also showed nuclide accumulation in the right superior lobe, the left suprarenal gland, and below the heart on top of the pericardium. An MRI of the neurocranium showed no pathological abnormalities.  An explorative thoracotomy with lobectomy of the right superior lobe and resection of the right dorsobasal inferior lobe was performed. Intraoperative biopsy revealed large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) (70%) with components of adenocarcinoma (30%) and involved visceral pleura. TNM classification of the tumor was rated as pT2b, pN0 (0/15), L0, V0, R0, G3. Surgical removal of the primary tumor in the lung and excision of the metastasis located in the left suprarenal gland was performed.  A subsequent cardio-MRI scan revealed a suspected tumor mass of 3.1 x 3.2 x 2.8 cm, borderline close to the inferior cava vein and the tricuspid valve. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) confirmed a tumor in the right atrium, originating from the lateral wall and reaching the border of the tricuspid valve.
