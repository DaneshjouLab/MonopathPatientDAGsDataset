A 57-year-old Italian man with recurrence of stage IV non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was consulted 3 weeks after his first cycle of pembrolizumab. Because of refractory stage IV non-small-cell lung cancer, pembrolizumab was started 21 days before presentation. He presented with dyspnea, pain in the right calf muscle, swelling of the lower limbs and was unable to walk for 2 days. He also presented with swelling and pain in the lower limbs, inability to walk and increasing dyspnea for 2 days. Since then, he experienced general discomfort, fatigue and bilateral weakness in the legs with exercise limitation. A diagnosis of pembrolizumab-induced grade III myositis was made based on muscle biopsy.
