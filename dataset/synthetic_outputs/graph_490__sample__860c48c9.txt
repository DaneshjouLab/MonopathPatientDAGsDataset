A 60-year-old male presented with a one-month history of moderate intensity low back pain. One day prior to admission, he experienced altered sensorium and decreased response. The patient reported unintentional weight loss of 8 kg and loss of appetite in the previous 2 months. He was a regular alcohol consumer and smoker for the last 30 years, with his last drink 5 days prior to the onset of symptoms.

The patient denied high-risk behavior and fever. He had no history of systemic hypertension or diabetes mellitus. On examination, his Glasgow Coma Scale was 8/15 (E2, V2, M4). He exhibited severe pallor, grade 3 clubbing, a heart rate of 100 bpm, a temperature of 37.4°C, and a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg.

Initial lab results revealed a hemoglobin of 7.8 g/dL (normocytic and normochromic), a leukocyte count of 18,000/mL (88% neutrophils, 10% lymphocytes, 2% monocytes), a platelet count of 220,000/µL, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 32 mm/hr, a serum alkaline phosphatase of 399 IU/L, a serum calcium of 14.0 mg/dL (serum albumin 3.8 g/dL), a phosphorus of 4.6 mg/dL, and an intact parathormone of 7.9 pg/mL. A peripheral smear showed a leukoerythroblastic blood picture. Chest X-ray and electrocardiogram were normal.

HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C serologies were negative. MRI of the brain showed multifocal lesions in bilateral parieto-occipital subcortical white matter and cerebellum.

Detailed brain MRI findings revealed multifocal lesions in bilateral parieto-occipital subcortical white matter and cerebellum. The lesions were hypointense on T1-weighted images, hyperintense on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery without any diffusion restriction and contrast enhancement, and apparent diffusion coefficient maps were hyperintense, suggesting Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES).

Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was normal.

A skeletal survey showed osteolytic bone metastases in the skull, thoracic and lumbar spine, and pelvis.

Bone marrow aspiration and trephine biopsy showed metastatic deposits from adenocarcinoma of the lung.

The patient was treated with intravenous fluids (normal saline), steroids, furosemide, and zoledronic acid.

After two weeks of treatment, the patient's serum calcium level normalized, and he regained consciousness.
