A 69-year-old woman with a history of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, and grade I obesity was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma with bilateral lung metastases harboring an HER2 exon 20 insertion (p.Tyr772_Ala775Dup). In December 2019, she received first-line treatment consisting of four cycles of carboplatin (AUC5), pemetrexed (500 mg/m2), and pembrolizumab (200 mg) every 3 weeks, achieving a partial response. In November 2020, stereotactic lung radiotherapy was delivered to the left lung lobe. In August 2021, she began maintenance therapy with pemetrexed and pembrolizumab, completing a total of 20 cycles. A CT scan in August 2021 revealed disease progression in the lung. Subsequently, the patient was included in the phase 2 randomized DESTINY-Lung02 study, with trastuzumab deruxtecan considered as a second-line therapy. In October 2021, after a cardiac evaluation revealed no morphologic or functional alterations, treatment with trastuzumab deruxtecan (blinded dose 6.4 mg/kg or 5.4 mk/kg) every 3 weeks was initiated. Twenty-one days after the first trastuzumab deruxtecan infusion, in November 2021, elevated troponin I levels were reported (1910 pg/mL) without any symptoms. An ECG was normal, and transthoracic echocardiography showed no repercussions on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Coronary angiography was performed and showed no significant lesions.
