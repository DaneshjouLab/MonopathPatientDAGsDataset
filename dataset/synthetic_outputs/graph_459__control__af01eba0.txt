Primary sarcomatoid carcinoma (SCA) is a type of rare tumor consisting of both malignant epithelial and mesenchymal components.

Here we report a 54-year-old male underwent emergency surgical resection in the small intestine due to severe obstruction and was diagnosed with multiple SCA based on postoperative pathological examination. Chemotherapy (IFO+Epirubicin) was performed after surgery while the patient died two months after the surgery due to severe malnutrition.

A 54-year-old Chinese male presented with abdominal distension, fatigue and loss of weight and was diagnosed with gastro and duodenal inflammation by gastroscopy with anemia at a local hospital. He was referred to our hospital due to symptoms aggravated within two weeks. Preoperative contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed multiple polypoid lesions in small intestine causing intussusceptions and obstruction. Laparotomy was then performed and approximately 1,000 mL ascites in the peritoneal cavity were found. Segmental resection of his whole jejunum and proximal ileum (total length of 300 cm, distal resected margin at 160 cm to the ileocecal valve) along with seven mesentery lymph nodes were performed. The final diagnosis was confirmed as jejunal SCA with mesenteric lymph nodes metastasis, pT3N2M0, stage IV.
