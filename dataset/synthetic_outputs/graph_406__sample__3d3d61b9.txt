A 78-year-old woman presented with a one-month history of anorexia, malaise, and a weight loss of 5 kg. Her CA 19-9 level was significantly elevated at 12,603 U/mL (normal range: <39 U/mL). The patient had a previous history of valvular and ischemic cardiomyopathy, status post aortic valve replacement two years prior, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and arterial hypertension. She denied smoking.

Due to these symptoms and the elevated CA 19-9, the patient was admitted for workup. Physical examination was unremarkable. Initial labs showed elevated aspartate aminotransferase at 75 U/L (normal <32 U/L), alanine aminotransferase at 62 U/L (normal <33 U/L), alkaline phosphatase at 150 U/L (normal 35-105 U/L), and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase at 200 U/L (normal <40 U/L), without hyperbilirubinemia.

Further lab results revealed: Hemoglobin 13.3 g/L (12.0-15.0), Leucocyte 5.6 x109/L (4.0-10.0), Platelets 177 x109/L (150-410), PT 11.3 seconds (9.7-11.8), INR 1.1 (<1.2), aPTT 24.9 seconds (20.6-29.5), Sodium 141 mmol/L (136-145), Potassium 3.77 mmol/L (3.5-5.1), Chloride 101.1 mmol/L (98-107), Calcium 9.3 mg/dL (8.8-10.2), Phosphate 3.5 mg/dL (2.5-4.5), Magnesium 1.8 mg/dL (1.6-2.6), Aspartate aminotransferase 86 U/L (<32), Alanine aminotransferase 50 U/L (<33), Alkaline phosphatase 175 U/L (35-105), Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase 286 U/L (<40), Total bilirubin 0.6 mg/dL (<1.2), Lactate dehydrogenase 254 U/L (135-214), Creatinine 0.87 mg/dL (0.7-1.2), Urea 46 mg/dL (<50), Albumin 4.1 g/dL (3.97-4.94), Creatine kinase 63 U/L (39-308), Reactive C protein 1.01 mg/dL (<0.5), CA 19-9 12,603 U/mL (<39).

A thoraco-abdomino-pelvic CT scan showed diffuse pulmonary emphysema and a heterogenous condensation in the lower right lobe, suggestive of an infectious process sequela. Common gastrointestinal neoplasms were excluded with a digestive endoscopy and a colonoscopy. A magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) excluded lesions in the biliary tract.

Pelvic examination and endocavitary ultrasound were normal. Urinary cytologic examination showed some atypical urothelial cells, but direct cystoscopy did not reveal pathologic findings, and a urologic CT scan excluded alterations in the urinary system. Following these investigations, the CA 19-9 decreased to 1984 U/mL. The patient regained appetite and weight.

An 18F-FDG PET/CT revealed densification in the inferior right pulmonary lobe and positive adenopathic peribronchial infiltration from that area up to the mediastinum.
