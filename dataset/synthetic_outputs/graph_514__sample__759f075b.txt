A 51-year-old non-smoking man presented for a routine physical examination due to right foot numbness. The patient had a history of hypertension managed with oral medications. A chest X-ray showed a high-density nodule located in the right upper lobe. Enhanced chest CT revealed a 31 mm nodule with enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes at 4R and 10R. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed at stations 4R and 10R through endobronchial ultrasound. Enhanced brain MRI and PET-CT showed no distant metastasis. Pathologic evaluation showed metastatic lung adenocarcinoma and the clinical stage was IIIA (cT2N2M0). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) revealed positive staining of cytokeratin AE1/AE3, thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), and Napsin A. ALK fusion status was positive by IHC (D5F3) and FISH (Vysis ALK Break Apart FISH Probe Kit; Abbott, IL, USA). The percent of rearranged cells in FISH was 45.7%. A multi-disciplinary team consultation was held by the department of respiratory, thoracic surgery, radiotherapy (RT), pathology and radiology.

The patient started on neoadjuvant alectinib at a dosage of 600 mg twice per day from April 28, 2020. After one cycle (28 days) of neoadjuvant alectinib therapy, CT and PET-CT scan confirmed a 42.2% tumor shrinkage. Clinical stage was IIIA (cT1N2M0). The patient was evaluated as partial remission (PR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. The patient did not show any side effects with alectinib treatment.

The patient underwent right upper lobectomy with mediastinal lymph node dissection by VATS after 45 days (2020/4/28â€“2020/6/11) of alectinib treatment. Mediastinal lymph node station 4R was inoperative due to severe tissue adhesion. The patient was discharged 5 days post-operation without complications. Pathologic evaluation with hematoxylin and eosin staining and IHC showed residual viable tumor cells at 15%, indicating MPR was not achieved.

The patient received adjuvant alectinib (600 mg oral BID) a week after surgery. Multi-disciplinary team consultation recommended sequential radiotherapy (RT) combined with alectinib therapy due to the patients without systematic mediastinal lymph node dissection (station 4R excluded).
