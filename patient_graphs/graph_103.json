Minimal past medical history and no known history of asbestos exposure. Palpable inguinal or pelvic adenopathy was absent bilaterally and the left testis and hemi-scrotum were clinically normal. Following failed initial conservative management with antibiotics the patient underwent urgent ultrasonography which revealed a complex cystic-solid lesion in the right scrotum invading the right testicle. Testicular tumour markers, alpha-fetoprotein, lactate dehydrogenase, and beta human choriongonadotropin levels were within normal limits.",

Macroscopic examination of the radical inguinal orchidectomy specimen revealed a hydrocele containing yellowish clear fluid and a large primarily exophytic mass (5.2 \u00d7 4.5 \u00d7 0.5 cm) on the surface of the tunica vaginalis and tunica albuginea, predominantly involving the latter. The surface of tunica vaginalis was studded by multifocal papillary tumour nodules (0.1\u20130.7 cm in diameter). Several small foci of stromal invasion and an additional 1.5 cm satellite lesion were noted. The mass was negative for invasion of the testes, epididymis, and rete testis with negative resection margins of the spermatic cord for tumour involvement; however, lymphovascular invasion was positive.",
