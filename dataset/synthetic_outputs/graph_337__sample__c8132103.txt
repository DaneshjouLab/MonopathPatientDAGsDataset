A 43-year-old female with a maternal history of breast cancer, but no personal history of smoking or neoplastic diseases, was admitted with a dry cough. On November 27, 2018, a contrast-enhanced CT scan revealed a 65.0 mm Ã— 61.5 mm mass in the right upper lobe with obstructive symptoms, along with multiple enlarged hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes. Subsequent laboratory tests showed elevated levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (157.25 ng/mL), cancer antigen-125 (81.3 U/mL), and circulating cytokeratin 19 fragments (CYFRA21-1; 19.03 ng/mL). A PET-CT scan revealed a high level of 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in the right upper lobe mass and right upper paratracheal nodes (2R), indicative of malignant disease and lymph node (2R) metastasis with no signs of distant metastasis. A CT-guided percutaneous biopsy of the right lung neoplasm was performed, and pathological analysis showed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemistry revealed positive staining of cytokeratin (CK), CD56, and thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1); napsin A was partially positive. Gene mutation testing was positive for ALK gene rearrangement. The final diagnosis was clinical stage IIIB (T3N2M0) pulmonary adenocarcinoma with hilar and mediastinal lymph node metastasis. PET-CT was performed.
