A 39-year-old middle-eastern female presented with progressive dyspnea and left shoulder discomfort. Chest x-ray revealed opacification of the left lung and computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest showed left-sided pleural effusion, and minimal pleural thickening, without accompanying parenchymal abnormalities. For further investigation of the malignant cells seen in cytology analysis, pleuroscopy was done by a pulmonologist, and multiple creamy nodular lesions were found on the visceral and parietal pleura. A second chest CT showed no signs of pulmonary emboli or pneumonia. However, the pleural effusion had been reaccumulated. Unfortunately, during the disease course in November 2021, the patient developed multiple peritoneal metastasis, pericardial effusion, and ascites and died due to the complications of the disease.
