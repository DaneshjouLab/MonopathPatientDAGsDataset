A 76-year-old woman was diagnosed with pulmonary adenocarcinoma (cT1bN0M0 stage IA) in November 2015, and right upper lobectomy was performed. The pathological stage was pT1bN2M0 stage IIIA. Genomic analysis revealed an *EGFR* mutation. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a programmed death-ligand 1 tumor proportion score of < 1%. The patient was under watchful observation without adjuvant chemotherapy. Multiple mediastinal and right hilar lymph node metastases were found in February 2018. Radiation therapy at a total dose of 60.0 Gy distributed in 30 fractions was performed over a period of 6 weeks. A computed tomography (CT) scan performed 6 weeks after irradiation therapy showed a reduction in lymph node metastases. However, left hilar and right supraclavicular lymph node metastases and multiple pulmonary metastases were newly observed outside of the irradiation field.
