A 72-year-old male was referred to our hospital complaining of progressive dysphagia for two years. The patient had a history of hypertension for several years. Endoscopy revealed a 2 cm long segment esophageal stenosis with intact mucosa and normal cardia. Computed tomography showed a right upper lung mass, and pathology of the right pleural effusion confirmed the diagnosis of right upper lung adenocarcinoma with multiple rib and mediastinal lymph node metastases and right malignant pleural effusion. The final diagnosis was changed to esophageal muscle metastasis arising from lung adenocarcinoma. Obviously, for the palliative treatment of benign or malignant esophageal strictures, flexible self-expanding metal (SEMS) can effectively provide rapid relief of dysphagia. Peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) has been widely performed as a standard treatment for achalasia; however, its efficacy and safety for treating distal esophageal segmental spasms induced by cancer metastasis remain unknown.
