In November 2020, a 57-year-old female presented with a one-month history of blurred vision and floaters. Prior to this presentation, starting in April 2020, the patient underwent four cycles of combined chemo-immunotherapy with carboplatin, etoposide, and durvalumab, achieving both clinical and radiological remission. She then continued maintenance durvalumab treatment, receiving a total of eight cycles by November 2020. After receiving the eighth cycle of durvalumab, the patient presented with blurred vision and floaters. Ophthalmic examination revealed aqueous cells 1+ and vitreous cells 1+ as well as bilateral oedema of the optic discs. Best-corrected decimal visual acuity (BCVA) was 0.7 and 0.8 for the right and left eye, respectively. Fundoscopy at presentation, on one-week and five-week follow-up showed diminishment of vitreous haze and regression of optic disc swelling. Bilateral optic nerve drusen were revealed on fundus autofluorescence (FAF) and confirmed on ocular ultrasound and optical coherence tomography (OCT). Optical coherence tomography (OCT) of optic discs at presentation and on a five-week follow-up showed no alteration in optic disc drusen size. Fluorescein angiography (FA) at presentation showed contrast blockage in the upper temporal part of the right optic disc corresponding to a peripapillary haemorrhage and hypofluorescent dots corresponded to hyperreflective spots on optical coherence tomography (OCT). The patient was treated with methylprednisolone. Fluorescein angiography five weeks on methylprednisolone treatment showed diminishment of the contrast blockage in the upper temporal part of the right optic disc corresponding to a peripapillary haemorrhage.
