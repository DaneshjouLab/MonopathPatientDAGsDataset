A patient presented with a 9 mm endometrial polyp with a feeder vessel. The patient's CA-125 level was 14 kIU/L, and the thyroid stimulating hormone serum concentration was 1.4 mIU/L. The patient underwent laparoscopy, which revealed a smooth and bulky left ovary and a small volume of green fluid in the rectovaginal pouch. During surgery, a 3 cm pink sea-anemone-like structure attached to the sigmoid peritoneum was found incidentally, adjacent to the left ovarian surface. The lesion was excised with a margin of peritoneum for histologic evaluation. The remainder of the pelvic and abdominal organs and peritoneum appeared normal. Hysteroscopy was unremarkable other than for a small endometrial polyp, which was excised. Microscopic evaluation of the peritoneal lesion showed well-defined papillary structures and benign papillary mesothelial proliferation consistent with Well-Differentiated Papillary Mesothelioma (WDPM). The pathology report of the peritoneal lesion showed no cytological atypia or infiltrative features. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated calretinin and CK 5/6 positivity within the mesothelial lining, consistent with well-differentiated papillary mesothelioma of the bowel peritoneum. The pathology report of the excised ovary demonstrated a struma ovarii consisting of benign thyroid tissue, mature fibroadipose connective tissue, and a variety of epithelia. The fallopian tube was normal. Cytological evaluation of the ascites found mesothelial cells and chronic inflammatory exudate. Ascitic microbiology was unremarkable. Retrospective review of pre-operative imaging was unable to visualize the WDPM. At the 6-week post-operative follow-up, the patient reported an uncomplicated recovery and resolution of the pelvic pain. Post-operative staging magnetic resonance imaging scan and transvaginal pelvic ultrasound scan showed no evidence of residual disease. Post-operative cross-sectional imaging did not detect any abnormality.
