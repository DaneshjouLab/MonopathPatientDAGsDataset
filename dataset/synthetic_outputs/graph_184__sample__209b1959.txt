An 80-year-old immunocompetent African-American man with a history of COVID-19 infection 6 months prior (did not require hospitalization), presented with progressively worsening dyspnea, productive cough, nocturnal sweating, anorexia, and three-month weight loss after returning from a month-long stay in Arizona. He received a 10-day course of Azithromycin followed by a 7-day course of Levofloxacin with no notable improvement immediately before admission.

Upon admission, the patient exhibited acute hypoxemic respiratory failure with oxygen saturation of 85% on room air, improved to 94% with 5L/min supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula. Vital signs were: heart rate 110 bpm, respiratory rate 27 breaths/min, blood pressure 102/85 mmHg, temperature 37.2 Â°C. Physical examination revealed bilateral basal crackles on lung auscultation, with no wheezing or accessory muscle use.

Cardiovascular and abdominal examinations were unremarkable: no murmur, peripheral edema, distended neck veins, hepatosplenomegaly, or tenderness. The skin was warm and dry, without cyanosis or clubbing. Nodular lesions were noted in the upper extremities.

The patient was alert and oriented, with no focal neurological deficits. Skin lesions included an ulcerated nodular lesion in the left hand and nodular lesions on the right arm.

Laboratory results showed: WBC 56.5 K/uL (high), RBC 3.18 M/uL (low), Hemoglobin 8.7 g/dL (low), Hematocrit 27.0 % (low), Platelet Count 330.0 K/uL, IANC 38.4 K/uL (high), Neutrophils % 67.9, Lymphocytes % 2.7 (low), Eosinophil % 4.3, Basophil % 1.2, Immature Granulocyte % 0.1 (high), C-Reactive Protein (CRP) 16.1 mg/dL (high), Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) 391 U/L (high), Procalcitonin 0.08 ng/mL, ANA Screen <1:40. Chest CT scan revealed extensive bilateral nodules exhibiting a miliary pattern and a moderate-sized pleural effusion on the right side.
