Bronchoscopy revealed an endoluminal plug with jelly-like consistency completely occluding the left upper lobe bronchus. The left upper lobe lumen was cleared using a combination of biopsy forceps and snare and a lingular growth was identified from which, biopsy was taken. Histopathology revealed necrotic fragments with colonisation of fungal organisms morphologically resembling Aspergillus, along with infiltration of the subepithelium with atypical cells. By immunohistochemistry, the latter cells were positive for vimentin and thyroid transcription factor-1, and were negative for EBV-LMP1, p63, synaptophysin and chromogranin, favouring a diagnosis of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of lung.",
