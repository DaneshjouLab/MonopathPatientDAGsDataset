In October 2017, a 79-year-old man was diagnosed with squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) stage IVA, cT3N2M1a. In November 2017, he started on docetaxel therapy (50 mg/m2). After 6 cycles of docetaxel, his right pleural effusion increased, and docetaxel was discontinued due to disease progression. In March 2018, he started on nivolumab therapy bi-weekly (1 to 10 cycles: 3 mg/kg and from 11 cycles: 240 mg/body) as second-line treatment. After 3 cycles of nivolumab, palliative radiotherapy (30 Gy) was administered for bone metastasis in the fifth vertebra. Nivolumab continued until 17 cycles. The right pleural effusion disappeared at about 7 cycles, and the patient's general condition improved. Twenty days after completing 17 cycles of nivolumab, he developed dyspnea and was urgently admitted to the hospital.

On admission, his body temperature was 36.5\u2103, blood pressure 94/58 mmHg, pulse rate 86 bpm, oxygen saturation 93% on room air and 85% on light exertion, and respiratory rate 28 breaths/min. He was classified as NYHA functional class 4. Cardiac sounds were normal, but coarse crackles were present in both lungs, along with swelling of jugular veins and pitting edema of lower extremities. Chest X-ray and CT showed edema predominantly in the right lung, bilateral slight pulmonary effusion, and cardiac dilatation. EKG revealed atrial flutter. Labs showed: WBC 8,400/\u03bcL, RBC 463\u00d710^4/\u03bcL, Hemoglobin 15.0 g/dL, Platelets 29.9\u00d710^4/\u03bcL, CRP 0.4 mg/dL, CK 76 IU/L, CK-MB 15 IU/L, Troponin I 92.7 pg/mL, BNP 1,061.5 pg/mL. Echocardiography showed diffuse hypokinesis of the left ventricular cardiac wall with LVEF of 20%. Interventricular septum thickness was 9.5 mm, and left ventricular posterior wall thickness was 9.6 mm. The LVEF had significantly decreased compared to 73% in June 2017. He was diagnosed with acute heart failure. Chest X-ray and CT scan showed cardiomegaly and bilateral pleural effusion.
