A patient presented with lung adenocarcinoma. Genetic testing revealed an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutation, specifically an exon 19 deletion and a T790M point mutation. The patient was treated with epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI) as molecular targeted therapy. Subsequently, the patient developed pneumatosis intestinalis, characterized by intra-mural air in the transverse colon and intrahepatic portal vein gas. Differential diagnoses considered included digestive tract obstruction, ischemic bowel disease, inflammatory bowel disease, autoimmune disease, infectious enteritis, intestinal tumour, and trauma. Pneumatosis intestinalis was considered a life-threatening disease.
