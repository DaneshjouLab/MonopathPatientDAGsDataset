A 59-year-old man with a 10-year history of coronary heart disease (with one stent implanted in the circumflex) was admitted to the clinic in March 2022. He presented with a persistent cough producing blood-streaked sputum for 6 months, which had worsened over the last 2 months. He had stable vital signs, no chest heartburn or pain, and no dizziness or palpitations (ECOG score: 1). Cardiac ultrasound indicated that cardiac function was lower than normal. He had no prior history of hypertension or diabetes mellitus. A CT scan with chest contrast revealed a right hilar mass enveloping the right pulmonary artery, and the right hilar lymph node was about 2.3 cm. A pathological tissue biopsy performed by tracheoscopy led to a diagnosis of stage IIIB squamous carcinoma of the right lung (pT4N2M0). A craniocerebral MRI enhancement scan and abdominal CT non-contrast scan did not reveal metastases. Cardiac ultrasound showed a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 50%. Initial electrocardiogram (ECG), cardiac enzymes, and liver and kidney functions were normal.

The patient was treated with a programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitor, tislelizumab, in combination with nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin. After one cycle of this combination therapy, the patient developed cardiotoxicity. Tislelizumab was discontinued and replaced with sugemalimab (PD-L1 inhibitor), while nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin were continued. After four cycles of immunotherapy with sugemalimab, a significant benefit was observed, and no further cardiotoxicity occurred. This case demonstrates that myocardial damage induced by tislelizumab can be improved after switching to sugemalimab and that antitumor immunotherapy is effective.
