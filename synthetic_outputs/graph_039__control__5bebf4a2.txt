A man in his 80s with comorbidities of hypertension, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease presented with shortness of breath. A chest CT scan revealed pleural effusion and a mass in the right lower lobe. The non-contrast chest CT scan showed a moderate amount of pleural effusion and a mass of 60x50x80 mm with heterogeneous internal density in the right lower lobe. He had high inflammatory reaction and was initially diagnosed as having pulmonary suppuration with empyema. He underwent antibiotic treatment. The diagnosis was pulmonary suppuration or lung cancer with infection, and surgical intervention was planned to control infection. Although the blood tests showed a decrease in inflammatory markers and the pleural effusion disappeared postoperatively, the thoracic mass continued to increase in size. High inflammatory reaction and pleural effusion caused by intratumoral infection made it difficult to distinguish from pulmonary suppuration before operation. Pathological examination, combined with clinical and radiological findings, led to the diagnosis of localized sarcoma-type malignant pleural mesothelioma. This case highlights a sarcomatoid-type LPM deriving from the visceral pleura that was preoperatively misdiagnosed as pulmonary suppuration because of high inflammatory reaction and pleural effusion.
