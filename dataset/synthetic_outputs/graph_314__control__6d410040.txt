A 69-year-old Japanese man, a current smoker with a 40 pack-year history and a family history of lung cancer, presented to the hospital with worsening shortness of breath. He had experienced shortness of breath for a month prior but delayed seeking medical attention due to the coronavirus disease pandemic.

Upon admission, his physical examination revealed a height of 166.5 cm, bodyweight of 62.0 kg, body temperature of 37.5Â°C, heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure of 146/106 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 91% (oxygen 4 l/min, at rest). His European Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) was 1. Laboratory results showed elevated levels of serum carcinoembryonic antigen (7.3 ng/ml), progastrin-releasing peptide (140 pg/ml), and neuron-specific enolase (132.0 ng/ml).

High-resolution chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a giant left lung mass with a massive left pleural effusion causing mediastinal shift to the right. Left-sided thoracentesis revealed that the pleural effusion was exudative with lymphocyte predominance. Cytological examination detected adenocarcinoma cells negative for thyroid transcription factor-1 and napsin A, but the number of tumor cells was insufficient for a definitive diagnosis.

Two thoracenteses did not allow for a diagnosis, but thoracoscopic pleural biopsy showed features of small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), adenocarcinoma, and a spindle-shaped cell tumor. Despite these findings, the patient could not be treated with chemotherapy. The patient's tumor increased by 2.59-fold in size in 20 days. He eventually died from a rapidly progressive tumor. Autopsy led to a diagnosis of combined small cell lung carcinoma (C-SCLC) with three different components: SCLC, adenocarcinoma, and a spindle-shaped cell tumor. The combination of C-SCLC with spindle-shaped cell tumor suggested rapid progression and a poor prognosis.
