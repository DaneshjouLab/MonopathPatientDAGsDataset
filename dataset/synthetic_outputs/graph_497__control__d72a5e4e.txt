A 79-year-old woman who had undergone surgery for recurred non-small cell lung cancer developed immune-related adverse events (irAEs) following ICI monotherapy. During ICI treatment, monthly measurements of serum antibody levels were conducted, including tumor-specific (anti-p53 antibody) and nonspecific (immunoglobulins) antibodies. Anti-p53 antibodies and IgM did not increase during ICI treatment. However, the serum levels of IgG and IgA gradually increased before the occurrence of irAEs. After seven cycles of ICI treatment, the patient developed a skin rash. Although treatment was stopped, pneumonitis occurred one month after the development of the skin rash. IgG antibodies gradually increased during irAEs. The serum levels of IgG and IgA increased before the occurrence of irAEs.
