A patient presented with a complex medical history involving both oncological and cardiovascular complications. The patient was diagnosed with lung cancer, which subsequently metastasized to the bone, resulting in bone metastasis. The patient also developed several cardiovascular issues, including cardiomyopathy, specifically dilated cardiomyopathy, leading to Heart Failure and acute heart failure episodes. Further cardiac complications included atrial flutter, arrhythmia, hypo-kinesis, cardiac fibrosis, cardiomegaly, myocarditis, and cardiotoxicity, ultimately culminating in cardiac arrest. The patient also experienced orthostatic hypotension. The patient also developed pleural effusion and pulmonary effusion. The constellation of these conditions suggests a challenging clinical course.
