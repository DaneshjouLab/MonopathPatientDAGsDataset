We present a case of a 33-year-old immunocompetent man diagnosed with invasive pulmonary cryptococcal disease with spread to the brain. The patient had been previously treated for tuberculosis. His presentation included typical bronchopulmonary thoracic and extra-thoracic features, as well as computed tomography (CT) scan features suggestive of lung cancer. Cryptococcosis was diagnosed by identification of oval thick-walled yeast on histology of a lung biopsy specimen. This case is unique because the patient's presentation contrasted with the typical presentation of Cryptococcal pneumonias and Cryptococcal meningitis. Invasive cryptococcosis affecting the lung and brain may present with a clinical picture similar to metastatic lung cancer. Pulmonary cryptococcosis patients often present as cryptococcal pneumonia, whereas intracranial cryptococcosis presents with meningitis. Pulmonary cryptococcosis may have intracranial dissemination and may show a variety of radiological features.
