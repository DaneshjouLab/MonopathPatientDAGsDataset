A 40-year-old Caucasian male with a past medical history of smoking presented with a 5-year history of occasional abdominal discomfort. He reported the onset of acute, stinging pain in the right upper abdomen. Clinical presentation of Benign Multicystic Peritoneal Mesothelioma (BMPM) usually includes chronic abdominal discomfort and mass-related symptoms like abdominal distension, tenderness or dyspareunia. Physical examination may reveal an abdominal mass. At the time of diagnosis, the mean diameter of BMPM is 13 cm. Ultrasound of the abdomen usually shows anechoic to mildly echogenic, multiseptated cystic structures in the pelvis composed of some lobulations and cysts.
