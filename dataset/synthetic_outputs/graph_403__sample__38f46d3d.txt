A 71-year-old male presented for a routine prostate gland consultation and was found to have a large hydrocele on clinical examination. Testicular ultrasound showed a right hydrocele with echogenic material, indicating chronicity, and a 3 cm heterogeneous, hyper-vascularized testicular tumor on the antero-inferior wall. The contralateral testis was normal.

The patient's history included 20 pack-years of smoking, arterial hypertension, sleep apnea syndrome treated by CPAP since the age of 55, primary tuberculous infection in childhood with a sequelae of pulmonary subpleural nodule, idiopathic sideroblastic anemia under erythropoietin since 2012, treated hypothyroidism, and dyslipidemia. Thoracic auscultation was normal. Tumor markers HCG and Î±-FP were normal. Thoraco-abdomino-pelvic CT showed no metastasis.

Surgical exploration revealed many hard and fleshy nodules on the testicular vaginalis. A radical orchidectomy was performed without lymph node excision. Histology noted a malignant mesothelioma of epithelioid type consisting of papillary and tubular structures. The tumor expressed the typical mesothelial markers of Calretinin, CK 5/6 and WT1.

Postoperative PET-CT showed no metastasis. The patient was followed with PET-CT every three months without further treatment.

Twenty-four months after initial treatment, CT showed a 14 mm lower mediastinal lymphadenopathy, which was hypermetabolic (SUV max at 8.7) on PET.
