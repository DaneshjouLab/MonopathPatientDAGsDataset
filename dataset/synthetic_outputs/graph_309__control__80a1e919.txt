A 43-year-old female patient presented to a local hospital with paroxysmal acanthesthesia of the tip of the tongue for more than 10 years, accompanied by a lisp in her speech. She was initially diagnosed with trigeminal neuralgia, but surgery did not improve her symptoms. The patient had no history of hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, or thyroid disease.

Later, the patient developed stiffness and painful spasms of the trunk axis and lower limb muscles, characteristic of Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS), a rare autoimmune disease of the central nervous system. Further investigation, including a CT-guided percutaneous lung biopsy, revealed focal alveolar epithelial dysplasia, diagnosed as adenocarcinoma in situ, a type of lung cancer. The possibility of withdrawal syndrome from clonazepam, which she had stopped taking six months prior, was excluded based on her medical history, clinical manifestations, laboratory, and imaging findings.

Ultimately, the patient was diagnosed with both Stiff Person Syndrome and lung adenocarcinoma. SPS is characterized by stiffness and painful spasms of the trunk axis and lower limb muscles with constant fluctuation and aggravation. Benzodiazepines are typically the first-line treatment for SPS. The case was considered a paraneoplastic stiff-person syndrome associated with lung cancer.
