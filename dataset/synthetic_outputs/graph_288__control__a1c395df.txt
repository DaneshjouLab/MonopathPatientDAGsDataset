A 60-year-old man with locally advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) underwent concurrent chemoradiotherapy. During the second course of chemoradiotherapy, he experienced grade 3 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, requiring dose reduction. Despite this, he completed the chemoradiotherapy.

Maintenance therapy with durvalumab was planned, but postponed due to sustained thrombocytopenia. A month later, after the platelet count recovered to 142 × 103/μL, durvalumab was initiated. Soon after, thrombocytopenia re-emerged, reaching a minimum level of 55 × 103/μL, despite normal hemoglobin concentration and white cell counts.

Durvalumab was discontinued after five cycles because the thrombocytopenia did not improve. Bone marrow specimen showed normoplasticity with marked megakaryocyte depletion, leading to a diagnosis of acquired amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenic purpura, inconsistent with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). The durvalumab-induced thrombocytopenia was attributed to this amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenic purpura, characterized by dysregulated immunity against thrombopoietin or its receptor.

Six months after discontinuing durvalumab, the platelet counts recovered to 110 × 103/μL. The case highlights the rare occurrence of hematological immune-related adverse events (irAEs), specifically immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, following durvalumab maintenance therapy after concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Although hematological irAEs are rare, occurring at a frequency of 0.5% for grade 2 or more, thrombocytopenia is the most common type. While immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are generally considered more tolerable than cytotoxic agents regarding hematological toxicity, fatal immune-mediated thrombocytopenia has been reported.
