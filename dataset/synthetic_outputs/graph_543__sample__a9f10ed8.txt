A 76-year-old male was diagnosed in 2021 with stage IV adenocarcinoma (cT2bN2M1b) without targetable genomic alterations (EGFR, ALK, ROS1). The initial diagnosis was based on a right abdominal muscle surgical resection, a chest CT showing a tumor shadow in the right lower lobe of the lung and multiple swollen lymph nodes in the mediastinum, and an 18F-FDG PET/CT revealing multiple 18F-FDG uptake in the right abdominal muscle, L4, and right iliac bone. Blood tests were normal, and the patient's ECOG score was 1.

The patient was enrolled in the IMpower 132 clinical study and received 6 cycles of carboplatin, pemetrexed, and atezolizumab (every 3 weeks). A CT scan after these 6 cycles revealed right lower pulmonary lesions and swollen lymph nodes, but also indicated a partial response of the lesions in the right lower lobe and swollen lymph nodes.

Subsequently, the patient underwent 36 cycles of maintenance therapy with pemetrexed and atezolizumab.

During maintenance therapy, the patient developed thrombocytopenia (platelet level: 91 x 10^3/uL) with normal hemoglobin and normal white cell counts. He was initially treated with interleukin-11 (IL-11) for 2 weeks to enhance the proliferation of megalokaryocytes. However, the platelet count slightly declined, and no autoimmune or coagulation disorders were displayed after IL-11 therapy. Atezolizumab-induced immune thrombocytopenia was suspected, and the patient was treated with prednisone (0.5mg/kg) for 2 weeks. The thrombocytopenia worsened, with a sudden decrease in platelet level to 35 x 10^3/uL. Pemetrexed and atezolizumab were discontinued. A bone marrow biopsy showed no morphological abnormalities, phagocytosis, or malignant invasion. Antinuclear antibodies and other laboratory tests were negative, but antiphospholipid and antiplatelet antibodies were abnormal, leading to a diagnosis of atezolizumab-induced immune thrombocytopenia.

The patient was then treated with a high-dose steroid for 6 consecutive days and recombinant human thrombopoietin (TPO). Despite four platelet transfusions, mycophenolate mofetil, and IVIG infusion, the platelet count remained low at 23 x 10^3/uL, with a recorded lowest level of 20 x 10^3/uL. Serum IL-6 level was significantly increased. Tocilizumab (400 mg), an IL-6 receptor antagonist, was added to the treatment regimen in addition to mycophenolate mofetil.

One week after tocilizumab treatment, the platelet counts started to increase and reached the normal range (100 to 300 x 10^3/uL).
