A 61-year-old female patient with no prior history of smoking, alcohol consumption, or exposure to specific substances presented with a lung mass in March 2019. She underwent a right middle and lower lobectomy with systematic lymph node dissection and chest tube placement at an outside hospital. Intraoperatively, a tumor approximately 4 cm x 3 cm was found at the opening of the right lower lobe bronchus. Postoperative pathology revealed poorly differentiated large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) with metastasis to lymph node groups 3, 7, and 11. The tumor stage was T2aN2M0, stage IIIA.

Histopathological examination using hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining led to the diagnosis of large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed the following results: TTF-1 (+), Napsin A (-), Vimentin (-), CKp (+), CK5/6 (-), CK7 (+), P40 (-), Syn (+), CgA (+), CD56 (+), Ki-67 (proliferation index: 60%), and ALK (+). Further testing revealed an echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (EML4-ALK) fusion mutation.

Neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) is a highly proliferative neuroendocrine tumor characterized by aggressive behavior and poor prognosis. The 2021 World Health Organization classification includes typical carcinoid (TC), atypical carcinoid (AC), small cell lung cancer (SCLC), and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) under the umbrella of neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC).
