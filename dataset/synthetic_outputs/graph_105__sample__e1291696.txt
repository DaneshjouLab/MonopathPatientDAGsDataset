A 38-year-old male smoker presented with stage 4, cT1bN3M1b, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) adenocarcinoma. Initial diagnostic workup to determine the specific EGFR mutation involved an initial biopsy from the mediastinal lymph node, which showed an EGFR exon 19 deletion using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Based on the EGFR exon 19 deletion, afatinib was administered as a first-line treatment. The patient showed a very good partial response with 7.1 months of progression-free survival. Disease progression occurred, and a subsequent biopsy from the newly progressed metastatic lymph node identified an acquired EGFRT790M mutation. Due to the acquired EGFRT790M mutation, the patient enrolled in a clinical trial (NCT03046992, YH25448-201) and received lazertinib, resulting in a partial response for 6.2 months. The patient subsequently developed malignant ascites. Deep-targeted sequencing of ascites samples demonstrated an acquired EGFRC797S mutation in cis (VAF 9.4%), EGFRT790M (VAF 3.5%), and EGFR exon 19 deletion (VAF 9.2%). Patient-derived cells (PDCs) established from the ascites sample showed EGFR exon 19 deletion.
