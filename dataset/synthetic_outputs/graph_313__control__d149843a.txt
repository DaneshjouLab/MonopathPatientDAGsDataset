A patient presented with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), specifically lung adenocarcinoma. Initial symptoms included chest discomfort. Chest computed tomography revealed pleural effusion and enlarged lymph nodes. Further investigation with positron emission tomography using fluorodeoxyglucose confirmed lymph node involvement. Magnetic resonance imaging was also performed. Diagnostic procedures included ultrasound-guided needle biopsy, thoracic drainage, and endobronchial ultrasound-transbronchial needle aspiration. Immunohistochemistry and polymerase chain reaction were used to analyze tissue samples. Genetic testing was performed to assess for mutations in EGFR, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, HER2, MET, PIK3CA, ALK, RET, and ROS1. The patient was found to have an EGFR delE709_T710insD mutation. Treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor dacomitinib was initiated, resulting in a partial response. Progression-free survival was monitored. Carcinoembryonic antigen levels were also tracked as a biomarker. The patient's lung adenocarcinoma, an EGFR-mutated NSCLC, was treated with dacomitinib, targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).
