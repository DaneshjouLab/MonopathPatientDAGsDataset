A 78-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital with a right lung tumor. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed a 4.0-cm right upper lobe tumor, leading to a diagnosis of right lung cancer (cT3N0M0, stage IIB). The patient underwent a right upper lobectomy and lymph node dissection. Pathological examination revealed the tumor to be pleomorphic carcinoma (pT3N0M0, stage IIB). Six months after surgery, tumor recurrence was observed in the lung, pleura, adrenal gland, and bone. Molecular profiling revealed high expression of PD-L1 without other molecular mutations. The patient received pembrolizumab monotherapy. After five cycles of pembrolizumab, the recurrent tumors showed shrinkage (Figure 1a,b). A skin rash developed after seven cycles of pembrolizumab, leading to the cessation of treatment. One month after the development of the skin rash, the patient developed pneumonitis (Figure 1c,d).
