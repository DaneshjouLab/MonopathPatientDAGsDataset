In May 2019, a 60-year-old male presented with cough, backache, and fatigue. He was subsequently diagnosed with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). A CT scan revealed a 25 x 31 mm primary tumor in the upper lobe of the left lung, invading mediastinal tissue and surrounding the aorta. The mediastinum showed several lymph nodes, the largest being 5 x 15 mm. The upper lobe of the right lung indicated two nodes, 5 mm and 7 mm respectively. A CT-guided percutaneous biopsy of the nodule confirmed adenocarcinoma by histopathological examination. The pathological stage was determined to be T4N2M1a (stage IV). Tumor marker CA125 was slightly increased (55U/ml), while CA199 and CEA were within normal limits. Molecular analysis showed no EGFR mutation. Due to the large size of the lesions and invasion of the mediastinum, surgery was not considered an option. From June 2019 to December 2019, the patient received first-line treatment consisting of 3 cycles of carboplatin 650mg (AUC5) plus paclitaxel 300 mg (175mg/m2) in combination with radiotherapy at the third cycle, achieving a partial response. A PET/CT scan in December 2019 showed a reduction in the size of the primary tumor to 12 x 7 mm, and the tumor marker values had returned to normal.
