In 2005, the patient underwent surgery and was diagnosed with stage IA pT1N0M0 lung adenocarcinoma. Five years after initial diagnosis, the patient presented with an endobronchial tumor near the postoperative margin and heterogeneous thickening of the pleura. Bronchoscopic tumor biopsy and pleural biopsy with video-assisted thoracic surgery detected adenocarcinoma, determined to be a recurrence. EGFR and ALK mutations were not detected. The patient received first-line chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel for four cycles, along with focal radiation therapy to the recurrent intratracheal tumor (30 Gy/10 fractions) and one pleural nodule (30 Gy/10 fractions). The patient received second-line therapy with cisplatin and docetaxel for four cycles but experienced disease progression. The patient was treated with tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil (S-1), but it was ineffective. Two years after recurrence of lung adenocarcinoma, brain metastasis was found. The patient's performance status (PS) was zero, and she had no neurological symptoms. Gadolinium contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI of the head showed a 4 mm strongly contrasted nodule in the left parietal lobe with surrounding edema. Gamma-knife treatment was started. Chest X-ray showed thickening of the right paratracheal line and protrusion of the right first arch and decreased permeability of the right lower lung field due to pleural effusion. PET-CT revealed a mass near the end of the right lower lobe bronchus with strong 18F-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose accumulation in the same area. Right pleural dissemination, eighth and ninth rib metastasis, and multiple mediastinal lymph node metastasis were observed. The patient received pemetrexed (PEM), resulting in improved clinical symptoms, decreased tumor size, and decreased CA125 levels. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography showed a marked improvement. Initial examination: PET-CT image was taken.
