In patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-sensitive mutations, acquired resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) remains the main cause of treatment failure. Although osimertinib, a third-generation EGFR-TKI, is effective for patients whose tumors acquire T790M mutations, cytotoxic chemotherapy is often chosen for several reasons.

Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LM) is a severe condition associated with lung cancer, and which occurs in 9.4% of patients with EGFR-mutated lung cancer. The median survival time (MST) of patients with LM is reported to be 8.9 months, with conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy only having limited efficacy. Recent reports have suggested that erlotinib (E) and bevacizumab (B) combination treatment (E + B treatment) could be a useful option for treating patients harboring EGFR-sensitive mutations who develop LM after first-generation EGFR-TKI therapy. However, there are currently no published reports on the usefulness of E + B therapy in patients who developed LM after treatment with a second-generation EGFR-TKI, afatinib. We herein report a case in which E + B was effective for treating LM after the development of acquired resistance to afatinib.
