A 42-year-old male with a history of complex active autoimmune disease presented with joint swelling and tenderness of fingers and ankles, rash, photosensitivity, and shortness of breath (SOB) consistent with antisynthetase syndrome. The patient was found to be ANA+ and dsDNA+ and received the final diagnosis of dermatomyositis. Subsequently, the patient was diagnosed with cT2aN1M0 NSCLC adenocarcinoma of the left lower lobe (LLL). CT chest revealed a 2-3 cm cavitary mass in the left lower lobe (LLL). Biopsy revealed NSCLC adenocarcinoma and left hilar adenopathy (N1). The patient received postoperative proton therapy (PT) to the lung cancer's positive bronchial margin. Following proton therapy, the patient developed a Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Effects Version 5.0 grade 5 tracheoesophageal (TE) fistula. The patient had MDA5+ and PL7-positive dermatomyositis and was placed on prednisone 15 mg every day and hydroxychloroquine. Mycophenolate was offered, and surgery was recommended. The patient underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery which was converted to an open procedure due to tissue adhesion. Mediastinal structures had dense desmoplastic reactions. Lung parenchyma was disintegrating. A vascularized pedicle soft-tissue flap (intercostal muscle flap) was bolstered to the bronchial stump following lobectomy for hemostasis control.
