Chest pain started 12 hours prior to the presentation and was described as mid-sternal, pressure-like, and squeezing in nature. The patient rated the pain as 8-9/10 in severity, with radiation to the left arm and jaw. The pain was transiently relieved by nitroglycerin and had no identifiable aggravating factors. Patient experienced shortness of breath (SOB) and occasional diaphoresis. He denied nausea, vomiting, palpitations, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND), or leg swelling. A cardiac workup (including an echo/ stress test) was done a year prior at an outside facility due to persistent dyspnea which was unremarkable. The patient reported regular annual physicals.",
