In January 2016, a 49-year-old male presented with left lower extremity proximal pain. Initial lumbar spine imaging suggested lumbar disc herniation. The patient subsequently developed periumbilical distension and pain. Abdominal CT revealed acute pancreatitis, multiple low-density nodules in the liver (nature pending), a left adrenal gland nodule (likely metastasis), and osteolytic destruction of the left ilium, acetabulum, left side of the pubic symphysis, and left pubic branch (likely metastasis). Further imaging with a chest CT showed a right upper lobe mass, multiple mildly enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, and bilateral pleural effusion. A head MRI demonstrated abnormal enhancement in the left frontal and parietal cortex (likely metastasis), with abnormal enhancement also present in the right frontal lobe (metastasis cannot be ruled out). A bone scan indicated abnormal tracer uptake in the left hip, proximal femur, and right scapula (likely metastasis). A percutaneous lung biopsy was performed. The lung biopsy confirmed non-small cell carcinoma, favoring adenocarcinoma, with immunohistochemistry positive for CK7, NaspsinA, TTF-1, and CK9, and negative for CK20. Gene testing revealed an EGFR 19 exon deletion mutation, with no ALK rearrangement and no KRAS mutation. The patient was started on erlotinib 150 mg daily.
