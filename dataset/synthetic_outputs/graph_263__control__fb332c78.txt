A 67-year-old woman presented with chest pain in September 2018. In April 2019, she developed progressive dyspnea, and chest ultrasonography revealed massive right-side pleural effusion. The patient was subsequently treated with pembrolizumab. On the day of pembrolizumab administration (day 0), she developed fever, nausea, vomiting, and chest pain. On day 8, the patient experienced sudden hypotension, hypoxemia, tachycardia, and rash. Laboratory examination showed transaminase elevation, acute kidney injury, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. The patient developed Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) after pembrolizumab initiation and presented with fever, rash, hypotension, hypoxemia, tachycardia, and multiple organ dysfunction. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is a rarely reported immune‐related adverse event in the field of immune checkpoint inhibitors therapy, raising challenges given the paucity of data with such presentations. Patients with CRS can present with fever, hypotension, and multiple organ dysfunction, the severity of which ranges from mild to life‐threatening.
