A 76-year-old woman, a former smoker with a 35 pack-year history, was referred for a long history of bilateral lung consolidation. Her past medical history included breast cancer 10 years prior, treated with surgery and radiotherapy. Radiological suspicion arose for lipoid pneumonia, and the patient reported using a nasal decongestant (hypertonic solution at 2.2% with hyaluronic acid). The left lung consolidation progressed, becoming more solid, and was positive on PET-FDG. A bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed but yielded negative results. Subsequently, a fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) of the consolidation was performed and was positive for lipoid pneumonia. A chest CT scan revealed bilateral pseudonodular lesions consistent with lipoid pneumonia with low central attenuation. The right lower lobe lesion measured 21 mm x 16 mm x 18 mm with ground-glass changes, while the left lower lobe showed a 33 mm x 24 mm x 35 mm pseudonodular image with irregular margins. Bilateral lung lesions measured nearly 6 cm in the postero-basal segment of the left lower lobe adjacent to bronchiectasis and reticulum-nodular thickening of the interstitium. Following surgery, the patient stopped using the nasal decongestant. A subsequent chest CT scan showed a 15 mm middle lobe lesion with low central attenuation and adjacent interstitial thickening. A 12-month follow-up showed a radiological profile consistent with the surgical resection performed, and no new suspicious consolidations were detected over time.
