A 70-year-old man with a 10 pack-year history of smoking, allergic rhinitis, and bronchial asthma (stable without inhaled corticosteroids) was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung cT4N3M1a stage IVA. Due to the EGFR mutation negative status and PD-L1 < 1%, the patient received two courses of cisplatin (60 mg/m2, day 1) and tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil (TS-1) (120 mg/body, days 1-14) as first-line treatment. No GCSF drugs were used during the initial chemotherapy course, and the eosinophil count did not exceed 300. Despite this treatment, the primary tumor enlarged, and diagnostic evaluation indicated progressive disease (PD). Atezolizumab (1500 mg every 3 weeks) was initiated as second-line therapy, resulting in a partial response (PR). After 19 cycles of Atezolizumab, the patient developed daily coughing, wheezing, and nocturnal symptoms. Fluticasone furanecarboxylate (200 \u03bcg)/umeclidinium bromide (62.5 \u03bcg)/vilanterol (25 \u03bcg) and a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) were administered. The eosinophil count increased from approximately 580 to 710. 30 mg prednisolone (PSL) was administered frequently as a burst dose, and continuous PSL was required. Respiratory function tests showed forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV1) of 1.59\u2009L, FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) of 64.37% and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) of 78\u2009ppb (normal range: 15\u201337\u2009ppb). The patient was subsequently diagnosed with severe asthma.
