A patient presented with chest distress and shortness of breath. The patient had a past medical history significant for hypertension, coronary heart disease, diabetes, hepatitis, typhoid fever, and tuberculosis. The patient was diagnosed with double primary lung cancer (DPLC). Further characterization revealed synchronous DPLC. The patient's lung cancers were identified as colloid adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma.

The patient underwent lobectomy with lymph node dissection. Postoperative chemotherapy was administered, consisting of pemetrexed and lobaplatin. Targeted therapy was also considered as part of the treatment plan.

Pathological examination revealed lymph node metastasis and pleural invasion. Further investigation identified the presence of solid predominant lung adenocarcinoma and invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma, in addition to the previously diagnosed colloid adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. The patient was ultimately diagnosed with multiple primary lung cancer, including triple primary lung cancer. The specific subtypes included adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Other potential diagnoses considered included bronchial adenoma and mucinous adenocarcinoma. The patient's condition was classified as Pulmonary CA.
