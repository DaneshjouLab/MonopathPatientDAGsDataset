Axillary ultrasound showed a 3.7 cm enlarged lymph node (LN) in the right axilla with effacement and hypervascularity. LN biopsy showed carcinoma with cytokeratin 7 (CK-7) and thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) positivity. P40 focally positive, findings consistent with lung adenocarcinoma, with a possibility of squamous component. PET scan showed multiple F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) avid nodes in the right hilum, thoracic inlet, mediastinum, and right axilla concerning metastatic disease. Brain MRI did not show intracranial metastatic disease. NGS showed high tumor mutational burden (TMB) with no other targetable mutations.",
