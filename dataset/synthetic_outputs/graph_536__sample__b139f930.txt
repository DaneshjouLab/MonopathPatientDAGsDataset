A 30-year-old woman, 6-months pregnant, presented with a complaint of chronic headaches that were relieved by pain relievers. After the seventh month of pregnancy, she developed slowly progressing left hemiparesis accompanied by numbness in the left side of her body, and right eyelid ptosis. She also reported that her mouth felt tilted to the right side and was then referred to the hospital for delivery.

Postpartum, a head CT scan revealed multiple intracranial masses. A chest X-ray showed vague opacification on the left lung, suspected as a lung mass. The patient subsequently complained of progressing diplopia and diabetes insipidus.

An MRI showed multiple intracranial lesions with a morphological cerebrospinal fluid cleft sign in the concavity of the parietal area, indicative of dural metastasis, along with multiple lesions on the sellar and suprasellar regions. MR spectroscopy showed lipid peaks. Serum cancer antigen (CA) 125 was measured at 81.0 U/mL, and serum carcinoembryonic antigen was 41.06 ng/mL.

The patient underwent a craniotomy for tumor removal. The pathology report confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma in the right parietal area. A chest CT revealed a spiculated mass with cavitation sized 1.9 \u00d7 2.5 \u00d7 2.05 cm in the apicoposterior segment of the left lung. A previous chest X-ray showed a small opaque lesion superior to the left hilum. Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma with multiple intracranial metastases.

Further characterization included MR spectroscopy, which showed a prominence lipid peak, with low choline in the central lesion. Pathology anatomy from the intracranial mass showed a tumor mass consisting of round, oval-shaped cells that grow hyperplastic lesions and in groups, some of which are in the structure of the gland and were concluded as metastatic adenocarcinoma. Axial chest CT soft tissue window showed an enhancing lesion in the lung parenchyma, and the axial chest CT lung window showed a cavitating mass.
