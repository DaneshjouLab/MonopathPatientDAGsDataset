A 77-year-old asymptomatic man with a 2.5-pack-year smoking history and a past medical history of prostate cancer surgery at age 61 and inguinal hernia surgery at age 75 presented with an abnormal shadow in the right middle lung field detected on a radiograph. His initial vital signs were: blood pressure, 117/53 mmHg; pulse rate, 59 beats/min; body temperature, 35.8Â°C; percutaneous oxygen saturation, 98%.

Physical examination revealed non-palpable neck and supraclavicular lymph nodes. Tumor markers (carcinoembryonic antigen, cytokeratin 19 fragment, pro-gastrin-releasing peptide, prostate-specific antigen) were within normal limits. Chest radiography revealed an ill-defined patchy shadow, 20 mm in size, in the right middle lung field. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a 20 mm subpleural ground-glass opacity with pleural indentation and spiculation in the superior segment of the right lower lobe (S6) area.

Further imaging with FDG-PET/CT showed FDG uptake (SUVmax=2.0) in the nodular shadow in the right S6. Abnormal FDG accumulation (SUVmax=approximately 6.0) was also noted in the bilateral ribs, lumbar vertebrae, bilateral femurs, and left ilium. No FDG accumulation was observed in regional lymph nodes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed no intracranial metastases but showed enhancements in the parietal bone, left temporal bone, and cervical spine, suggestive of bone marrow reversion.

A CT-guided percutaneous biopsy of the lung nodule was performed, revealing fibrosis of the alveolar tissue and moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with an acinar pattern within the fibrosis.

Based on these findings, the patient was initially diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma [positive for an epidermal growth factor receptor mutation (L858R)] and staged as clinical stage IVB (cT1bN0M1c) with multiple bone metastases. MRI of the pelvic cavity showed lesions diffusely spread over the lumbar spine, pelvis, and femur with a high signal intensity on T2-weighted, short TI inversion recovery, and diffusion-weighted imaging and a low signal intensity on T1-weighted phase contrast imaging, suggesting the possibility of re-conversion to the red marrow.

Given the abnormal FDG uptake in the red bone marrow, a CT-guided biopsy of the left iliac bone was performed. The biopsy revealed infiltration with small atypical lymphocyte-like cells (CD5-positive, CD20-positive, CD43-positive, CD3-negative, CD10-negative, CD33-negative, and cyclin D1-negative) along the bone trabeculae without lung cancer metastases, leading to a diagnosis of a low-grade B-cell lymphoma. Bone marrow examination confirmed B-cell clusters in some areas, CD20 positivity, and CD5 positivity, consistent with low-grade B-cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL).

Following the diagnosis of the second primary malignancy, the lung cancer was restaged to cT1bN0M0, stage IA2. MRI of the pelvic cavity showed diffuse high-signal lesions in the lumbar spine, pelvis, and femur on T1-weighted in-phase images and diffusion-weighted images; these lesions had a low signal on T1-weighted out-of-phase images. FDG-PET/CT showed uptake of FDG in the left ilium. A CT-guided percutaneous needle biopsy of the left iliac bone was performed.

The iliac biopsy confirmed infiltration of small tumor cells positive for CD20 and CD5 and negative for CD3.
