A 68-year-old white female cadaver, whose cause of death was recorded as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, was found to have an enlarged left-sided supraclavicular lymph node, or Virchow node (VN), during neck dissection. The VN, measuring 3.7 × 2.4 × 1.4 cm, was situated at the jugulo-subclavian venous junction (venous angle), a typical location for a VN. It was deep to the platysma and clavicular head of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, underlying what would otherwise be considered the lesser supraclavicular fossa. The superior pole of the VN was under the inferior aspect of the superior omohyoid muscle at its attachment with its intermediate tendon. The VN was located immediately lateral to the internal jugular vein and, along with the thoracic duct, was located just superior to the subclavian vein. Underlying the VN was the phrenic nerve, transverse cervical artery, and anterior scalene muscle.

The VN was resected and macroscopically assessed, revealing that the node was enlarged by tumor. Histological studies revealed evidence of neoplastic cells, with a high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio and aberrant nuclei and nucleoli, embedded within residual lymphoid tissue. Intra- and extra-cellular mucin was also identified. Comparison of the histopathology of the VN and a parahilar mass revealed marked similarities, indicative of a primary parahilar adenocarcinoma metastatic to the left supraclavicular VN.

The VN was in close proximity to several anatomical structures. The anterior scalene was located posterior to the VN, suggesting that enlargement of the VN may have compressed the anterior scalene muscle. Because the anterior scalene forms the anterior boundary of the scalene triangle, through which the brachial plexus of nerves and the subclavian artery pass, enlargement of the VN may have caused left-sided brachial plexopathy and decreased blood flow into the left upper extremity. The left phrenic nerve was located between the VN and the anterior scalene muscle. Therefore, enlargement of the Virchow node could have encroached upon the left phrenic nerve, potentially contributing to unilateral phrenic neuropathy. It is possible that the VN compressing the phrenic nerve may have contributed to dyspnea in this individual, whose cause of death was listed as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease but was determined to have pulmonary adenocarcinoma and increased alveolar dead space.
