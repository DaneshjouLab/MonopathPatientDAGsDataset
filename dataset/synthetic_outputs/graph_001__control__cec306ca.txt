A 44-year-old male was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung.  The patient was found to have pituitary and renal metastasis, detected via <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT.  Metastases from squamous cell carcinoma of the lung typically occur in the brain, liver, adrenal glands, bone, and regional lymph nodes. Pituitary and renal metastases from squamous cell carcinoma lung are rare, with incidences of symptomatic pituitary and renal metastasis being &lt;1% and 5%, respectively.  <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT is the standard of care for clinical staging of patients with lung cancer and enabled the identification of these occult metastases.
