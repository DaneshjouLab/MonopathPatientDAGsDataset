An 81-year-old never-smoker man with a history of nonischemic heart disease, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and dyslipidemia presented with discolored skin lesions on the chest and abdomen. In October 2022, a computed tomography (CT) scan revealed thickening in the retrohilar and paramediastinal regions of the lower right lobe, bilateral pleural effusion, carcinomatous lymphangitis, axillary, mediastinal, and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathies, and a solid pancreatic lesion with infiltration of the spleen and left adrenal gland. After comprehensive evaluation, including skin biopsy and molecular profiling, the patient was diagnosed with enteric-type adenocarcinoma of the lung (lung-ETAC) with a BRAF p.V600E mutation. Lung-ETAC is a rare form of lung cancer with histologic similarities to colorectal cancer, with aggressive behavior and unfavorable prognosis. Treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib initially resulted in positive results, with improvement in skin lesions and overall clinical condition, achieving complete cutaneous response. Nevertheless, approximately 6 months after, the disease had progression with new skin lesions reappearing. This case highlights the potential for targeted therapy in patients with lung-ETAC harboring a BRAF p.V600E mutation.
