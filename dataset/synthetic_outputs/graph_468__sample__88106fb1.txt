A 69-year-old Japanese woman was diagnosed with clinical stage IV (T2aN2M1b in 7th edition) lung adenocarcinoma with pleural and bone metastasis. EGFR gene mutation was not detected in malignant pleural effusion by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). She started carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab as the first-line treatment. Following progression on first-line treatment, pemetrexed was administered as second-line treatment. After progression on second-line treatment, erlotinib was administered as third-line treatment. Following progression on third-line treatment, docetaxel was administered as fourth-line treatment. Lung cancer progressed with increased pleural effusion after one cycle with gemcitabine (fifth-line treatment). EGFR gene mutation studied in pleural effusion using PCR fragment analysis/PCR clamp method revealed a deletion in exon 19 and a T790M point mutation in exon 20. Afatinib was started as sixth-line treatment with a PFS of 4.0 months. Afatinib treatment continued for 15.3 months (458 days). At 74 years old, the patient started osimertinib (80 mg/day) as seventh-line treatment. Her BMI was 16.2 kg/cm2, and performance status was 1. She developed grade 1 cutaneous pruritus and stomatitis (CTCAE ver 4.0) as adverse events from osimertinib. She experienced gradual improvement in shoulder pain from bone metastasis while on osimertinib. Oxycodone was stopped on the 87th day after osimertinib was started. The best response to osimertinib was stable disease. Follow-up CT at day 97 after treatment with osimertinib showed intra-mural air in the transverse colon and intra-hepatic portal vein gas, suggestive of pneumatosis intestinalis. No free air in the abdominal cavity. Lung cancer did not progress. Abdominal computed tomography showed intra-mural gas in the wall of the transverse colon and intra-hepatic portal vein gas in the peripheral area of the liver. White blood cell count was 3500/\u03bcL (normal range: 3400-9200/\u03bcL).
