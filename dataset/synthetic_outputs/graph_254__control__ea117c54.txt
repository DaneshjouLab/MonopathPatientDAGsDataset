A 53-year-old man, a resident of a Mediterranean coast area (south of France), was admitted with a history of fever, fatigue, no weight loss, and prolonged pancytopenia. The pancytopenia began three weeks after a first cycle of maintenance chemotherapy with pemetrexed (500 mg/m2). Prior to this, he had received 4 cycles of chemotherapy combining cis-platinum and pemetrexed for non-progressive advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. Maintenance chemotherapy is a standard treatment in patients with this condition after induction therapy.

Despite filgrastim injections, the pancytopenia persisted. A bone marrow aspiration revealed a macrophage activation syndrome with Leishmania amastigotes. A Polymerase Chain Reaction test confirmed the diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis (kala azar). The prolonged pancytopenia, initially presumed to be drug-induced, was in fact related to the visceral leishmaniasis. Treatment with liposomal amphotericin B was started.

While pemetrexed has a low incidence for bone marrow toxicity, pancytopenia can occur, leading to delays in further cycles. Nevertheless, other causes of anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia can be found in immunocompromised patients.
