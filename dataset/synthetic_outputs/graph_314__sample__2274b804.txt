A 69-year-old Japanese man, a current smoker with a 40 pack-year history and a family history of lung cancer, presented with worsening shortness of breath. His height was 166.5 cm and bodyweight 62.0 kg.

On admission, his temperature was 37.5°C, heart rate 110 bpm, blood pressure 146/106 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 91% on 4 l/min oxygen at rest. His ECOG performance status was 1. Laboratory data revealed: WBC 11700 /µl, Neutrophils 86.5 %, Lymphocytes 7.7 %, Eosinophils 0.3 %, Monocytes 5.2 %, RBC 4.65 × 106 /µl, Hb 14.4 g/dl, Ht 41.9 %, Platelets 30.9 × 104 /µl, TP 6.2 g/dl, Alb 2.8 g/dl, T-bil 1.4 mg/dl, CRP 6.46 mg/dl, AST 51 IU/l, ALT 38 IU/l, Glucose 258 mg/dl, HbA1c 7.8 %, LDH 737 IU/l, BUN 4.2 mg/dl, Cre 0.72 mg/dl, Na. Serum carcinoembryonic antigen was 7.3 ng/ml, progastrin-releasing peptide 140 pg/ml, and neuron-specific enolase 132.0 ng/ml. A chest CT scan revealed a giant left lung mass with massive left pleural effusion causing mediastinal shift to the right.

Left-sided thoracentesis was performed, revealing exudative pleural effusion with lymphocyte predominance. Cytology showed adenocarcinoma cells, negative for thyroid transcription factor-1 and napsin A, but there were insufficient tumor cells for a definitive diagnosis. Dyspnea improved after left-sided chest tube drainage on the fifth day.

Further cytological examination of the left pleural effusion revealed round tumor cells negative for adenocarcinoma. A subsequent left pleural effusion cytology was nondiagnostic. A transbronchial lung biopsy from left S4 on day 12 was also nondiagnostic.

On day 21, a thoracoscopic pleural biopsy revealed features of small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), adenocarcinoma, and spindle-shaped cell tumor, consistent with combined small cell lung carcinoma (C-SCLC). The PD-L1 tumor proportion score was less than 1%.

Post-thoracoscopy, the patient's respiratory and general conditions rapidly worsened. The patient died on day 34. Autopsy revealed a large, erupted tumor occupying almost the entire lower lobe of the left lung with circumferential adhesion and infiltration of the left chest wall and diaphragm.

Microscopic findings confirmed the presence of SCLC (60%), spindle-shaped cell tumor (30%), and adenocarcinoma (10%), leading to a final diagnosis of combined small cell lung carcinoma (C-SCLC) including three tumor components. The pleural biopsy specimen also showed small-cell lung carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and spindle-shaped cell tumors. The small-cell lung carcinoma lesion was positive for insulinoma-associated protein 1. The tumor increased in size rapidly, and the patient's respiratory condition and performance status worsened.
