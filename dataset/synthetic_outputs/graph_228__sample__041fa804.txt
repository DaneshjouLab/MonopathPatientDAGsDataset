A 61-year-old man was diagnosed with clinical T3N2M0 stage IIIC lung squamous cell carcinoma with a PD-L1 expression of 1% in June 2018. He was started on first-line treatment with chemotherapy consisting of carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel. Subsequently, he developed difficulty breathing with symptoms of superior vena cava syndrome caused by enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes and carcinomatous pericarditis. He received 1 mg of oral dexamethasone and palliative radiotherapy for lymph node metastases and pericardium with a total dose of 30 Gy in daily fractions of 3 Gy. A follow-up CT scan showed progression of adrenal metastasis. He was then treated with 1,200 mg intravenous atezolizumab. Twenty-one days after atezolizumab administration, the patient was admitted with relatively well-circumscribed erythema at the previously irradiated skin field. A skin biopsy showed interface dermatitis with perivascular lymphocytic inflammatory cell infiltration. He was diagnosed with a severe skin disorder (CTCAE version 5.0, Grade 3) related to radiation recall dermatitis (RRD) induced by atezolizumab treatment. Histopathology included Hematoxylin and Eosin staining, and Immunohistochemical staining for CD8 and PD-L1. Atezolizumab treatment was discontinued. Intravenous methylprednisolone (2 mg/kg/day) was initiated for 3 days, followed by intravenous methylprednisolone (1 mg/kg/day) for 4 days, and then oral prednisolone was reduced to 40 mg/day.
