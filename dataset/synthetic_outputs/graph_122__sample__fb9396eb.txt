A 45-year-old man with a significant smoking history (56 pack-years) and daily alcohol intake of 60 g presented with left shoulder pain. Further investigation led to a diagnosis of stage IV (cT4N3M1c) adenocarcinoma with brain and bone metastases, confirmed by lung biopsy, computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography-CT, and head magnetic resonance imaging. Genetic tests revealed negative driver gene mutations and PD-L1 expression. Pre-treatment blood tests showed the following results: white blood cell count, 10,320/\u03bcL; hemoglobin, 12.9 g/dL; platelets, 473 \u00d7 103/\u03bcL; total protein, 6.9 g/dL; albumin, 3.3 g/dL; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 75 U/L; alanine aminotransferase, (ALT) 35 U/L; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 353 U/L; and C-reactive protein, 4.19 mg/dL. The patient was started on a first-line chemotherapy regimen consisting of Carboplatin (CBDCA), pemetrexed (PEM), and pembrolizumab. Five days after chemotherapy initiation, blood tests revealed grade 2 hepatitis (AST 155 U/L; ALT 258 U/L) based on the Common Terminology for Adverse Events (CTCAE) ver. 5.
