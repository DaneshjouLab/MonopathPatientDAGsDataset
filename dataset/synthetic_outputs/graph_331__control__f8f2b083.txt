A patient presented with disease progression and a thrombotic diathesis. The patient subsequently developed a pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis. Further investigation revealed intracerebral infarcts and hepatic metastases, indicating advanced disease. The patient also exhibited hypofibrinogenemia, suggestive of disseminated intravasal coagulopathy. The patient's condition was further complicated by intracerebral thromboses, confirming the presence of a thrombotic diathesis. The overall clinical picture was consistent with disease progression complicated by a severe thrombotic diathesis and disseminated intravasal coagulopathy.
