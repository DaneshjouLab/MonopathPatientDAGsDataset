In October 2020, an 81-year-old man was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma (T4N2M1). In November 2020, he received gyroknife radiotherapy for left and right lung malignancies 12 times. Due to tumor progression, he started anlotinib 8mg orally once daily for 14 days every 3 weeks in September 2022. After 14 cycles of anlotinib treatment, on July 12th 2023, the patient presented with a fasting plasma glucose of 26.1 mmol/L and urine ketone (+++). He was admitted to the Endocrinology Department of Chongqing General Hospital. Laboratory findings included: GADA > 2000 IU/ml, ICA 43.4 COI, IAA < 1 CDI, Fasting blood glucose 24.3 mmol/L, Fasting insulin 0.83 uIU/L, Fasting C-peptide 0.13 ng/ml, Hemoglobin A1c 9.0 %, Hemoglobin 96 g/L, Serum albumin 27.2 g/L, TC 4.17 mmol/L, TG 0.67 mmol/L, LDL-C 2.43 mmol/L, Crea 87.7 umol/L, AST 16 U/L, ALT 11.6 U/L, TSH 5.32 mIU/L, FT3 4.41 pmol/L, FT4 18.0 pmol/L, pancreatic amylase 63.6 U/L, lipase 14.5 U/L. He was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and treated with insulin degludec in combination with insulin aspartate. On July 19th, 2023, he was discharged with the hypoglycemic regimen (insulin degludec 5 units in the morning and insulin aspartate 4 units three times a day). One week after discharge, he reported a significant increase in blood glucose levels after re-starting anlotinib. The highest blood glucose level recorded was 30.1 mmol/L, and the insulin dose was increased to maintain his glucose levels. During anlotinib treatment, blood glucose decreased significantly, and the dosage of injected insulin was decreased. After two cycles of anlotinib treatment, anlotinib was discontinued due to tumor progression and its significant negative impact on glucose metabolism. After 16 cycles of anlotinib treatment, laboratory parameters showed improvement: GADA < 10 IU/ml, ICA < 1 COI, IAA < 1 CDI, Fasting blood glucose 8.7 mmol/L, Hemoglobin A1c 8.1 %, Hemoglobin 113 g/L, Serum albumin 30.4 g/L, TC 4.39 mmol/L, TG 0.58 mmol/L, LDL-C 2.15 mmol/L, Crea 90.1 umol/L, AST 17.8 U/L, ALT 12.3 U/L.
