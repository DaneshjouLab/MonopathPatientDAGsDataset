An 82-year-old man with a 6-year history of type 2 diabetes, managed with oral medication, was referred to the hospital in March 2018 following a routine chest X-ray that raised suspicion for interstitial lung disease. The patient was an ex-smoker, having smoked 1.5 packs per day from ages 20 to 55. He reported no history of asbestos exposure, bird rearing, or family history of interstitial lung diseases. There was no suspicion of new medication use or connective tissue disease.

Hematology results showed WBC 7500/μL with Neutrophils 46.6%, Lymphocytes 40.4%, Monocytes 6.1%, Eosinophils 5.6%, and Basophils 1.1%.
