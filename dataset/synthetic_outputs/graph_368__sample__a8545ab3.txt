A 68-year-old Japanese man, a current smoker with a 50 pack-year history and a heavy drinker, with an ECOG performance status of 0, was diagnosed with stage IVB (T3N2M1c) lung adenocarcinoma. The primary lung cancer lesion, with a maximum diameter of 59 mm, was located in the right lower lobe. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy and two brain metastases, 7.0 and 4.0 mm in size, were also observed. Pathological examination of a biopsy specimen from the primary lesion, obtained by bronchoscopy, confirmed adenocarcinoma. The tumor had neither an epidermal growth factor receptor gene mutation nor an echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4-anaplastic lymphoma kinase fusion. Ten months prior to the lung cancer diagnosis, the patient had a history of bleeding from a cavernous hemangioma in the brain.

The patient's PD-L1 expression tumor proportion score was 1-24%. Serum hepatitis B virus (HBV)-DNA was detected (<0.1 IU/mL), and the patient was treated with entecavir until negative conversion. Stereotactic ablative surgery was performed on the two small brain metastases. First-line chemotherapy, consisting of 4 cycles of carboplatin (area under the curve =5) and pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) and pembrolizumab (200 mg/body), was initiated, followed by pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) and pembrolizumab (200 mg/body) maintenance therapy.

Pemetrexed was stopped after two cycles of maintenance therapy due to worsening anemia, and pembrolizumab was continued as monotherapy.

Approximately 4 months after pembrolizumab monotherapy initiation, a 1.9-mm nodule appeared in the right S3 lesion. The lung cancer showed some response to the treatment. Very small nodules were confirmed in the right S3 lesion at the time of the diagnosis of lung cancer.

Seven months after anticancer therapy initiation, the right S3 nodule showed no significant change in size or lung cancer. The patient's CRP level was 0.09 mg/dL. Three consecutive sputum tests for acid-fast bacilli were performed: all smears were negative, but the culture was positive for acid-fast bacilli 17 days after incubation, and confirmed to be M. tuberculosis by PCR. The QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus (QFT) test was negative.
