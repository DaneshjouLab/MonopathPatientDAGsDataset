In May 2018, a 37-year-old never-smoker woman was diagnosed with stage IIIB (cT3 cN2 according to TNM, VIII edition) adenocarcinoma of the left lung. Her ECOG performance status was 0, and she had no family history of cancer.

The patient underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin AUC 2 and paclitaxel at 50 mg/sm with concurrent radiotherapy of the left lung (64 Gy in 32 fractions).

Following neoadjuvant therapy, the patient underwent lobectomy of the left upper lobe, with a final diagnosis of adenocarcinoma ypT1b N2, EGFR and ALK wild type, and PD-L1 (tumor proportion score) of 60%.

In June 2019, multiple nodules of the thoracic wall, pleural nodes, and pleural effusion were detected, indicating disease recurrence.

A liquid biopsy was performed, excluding the presence of EGFR mutations.

The patient started treatment with cisplatin at 75 mg/sm and pemetrexed at 500 mg/sm for four cycles, followed by pemetrexed maintenance, with partial response of disease.

In February 2021, a radiological examination revealed a volumetric increase of the pleural nodes and effusion, indicating disease progression.

Thoracoscopy with rebiopsy of the pleural nodes confirmed adenocarcinoma metastasis; no alterations of EGFR, ALK, or ROS1 were detected.

From April to July 2021, the patient was treated with pembrolizumab at 200 mg, achieving a disease progression in lymph nodes and pleural nodes.
