A 62-year-old Black American male with a medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, small-cell lung cancer, and a 30-pack-year smoking history (ceased 30 years ago) presented to the emergency department (ED) with acute chest pain. The chest pain started 12 hours prior to the presentation and was described as mid-sternal, pressure-like, and squeezing in nature. The patient rated the pain as 8-9/10 in severity, with radiation to the left arm and jaw. The pain was transiently relieved by nitroglycerin and had no identifiable aggravating factors. The patient experienced shortness of breath (SOB) and occasional diaphoresis. He denied nausea, vomiting, palpitations, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND), or leg swelling. A cardiac workup (including an echo/ stress test) was done a year prior at an outside facility due to persistent dyspnea which was unremarkable. The patient reported regular annual physicals.

The patient visited the ED earlier that day for similar symptoms but was discharged after no acute findings were observed. Blood pressure (BP) of 124/76 mmHg, heart rate (HR) of 64 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99-99% on room air. EKG revealed normal sinus rhythm with a ventricular rate of 84 beats per minute (bpm), T-wave inversion in lead V2, and no ST-segment elevation or depression. Laboratory studies showed a troponin level of 62 ng/L, which increased to 63 ng/L six hours later (reference range: 0-20 ng/L), indicating a stable trend. The patient returned to the ED due to persistence of symptoms. Glucose level of 108 mg/dL (reference range: 74-106 mg/dL), total cholesterol of 224 mg/dL (reference range: <200 mg/dL), and LDL cholesterol of 146 mg/dL (reference range: <100 mg/dL). Vital signs: blood pressure of 167/110 mmHg, heart rate of 139 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Physical examination revealed tachycardia but no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Respiratory examination was unremarkable with clear breath sounds bilaterally.

A repeat EKG revealed ST elevation in the anterior leads (V1-V4) and reciprocal changes in the inferior leads (II, III, AVF). Cardiology consultation was obtained, an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) protocol was activated, and the patient was transferred emergently to the catheterization laboratory. Coronary angiography revealed extensive thrombus in the proximal left anterior descending (LAD) artery, proximal circumflex artery, and high obtuse marginal (OM) branch.

Drug-eluting stents were successfully placed in the LAD and circumflex OM branches. Post-procedure left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) was estimated at 25%, down from 30% to 35% on an echocardiogram (2D echo) performed two weeks earlier. Anterior wall hypokinesis was also observed. The patient stabilized in the intensive care unit (ICU) on a regimen of aspirin, prasugrel, and tirofiban. Goal-directed medical therapy was initiated to manage blood pressure. A wearable defibrillator was placed for cardiac protection. The patient was discharged on apixaban and prasugrel due to suspected hypercoagulable state secondary to malignancy and recent cancer treatments.

The patient's oncological history is significant for small-cell lung cancer diagnosis in March 2023, following identification of a left neck mass. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy was revealed. Biopsy confirmed small-cell lung cancer with neuroendocrine differentiation. Initial treatment included cisplatin, etoposide, and durvalumab. Radiation therapy was completed in June 2023.
