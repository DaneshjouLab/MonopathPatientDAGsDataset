A 13-year-old female dog presented with dyspnea and lethargy on day 1. Thoracic X-ray revealed a large, bulging heart, suggesting pericardial effusion. Ultrasound examination confirmed a high amount of fluid between the heart and pericardium. The patient underwent pericardiocentesis, resulting in the drainage of 220 ml of bloody fluid. Analysis of this fluid was inconclusive.

Fifteen days later, the dog returned with the same ailment, and 440 ml of bleeding pericardial effusion was drained. Analysis of this fluid was suggestive of neoplasia. On day 23, the patient returned and was referred to the hospitalâ€™s video-surgery department, where another pericardiocentesis was performed, draining 295 ml.

To minimize the risks of death due to cardiac tamponade and to provide a definitive diagnosis, a thoracoscopic pericardiectomy involving intercostal and paraxiphoid accesses was performed on day 27.

The patient was diagnosed with mesothelioma, a very aggressive malignant tumor. Pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade were consequences of the mesothelioma. Later, the dog underwent thoracoscopic implantation of a fully implantable catheter to function as a thoracic drain. The authors considered that there was an improvement in the quality of life.
