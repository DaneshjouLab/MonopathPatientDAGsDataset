A 76-year-old woman with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma presented with acute onset fevers, dyspnea, and cough. Three months prior to this presentation, she had been diagnosed with lung cancer after presenting with hypoxemia on exertion. Computed tomography (CT) at that time showed a right upper lobe mass with evidence of lung and liver metastases. Biopsy of the lung and liver revealed metastatic adenocarcinoma consistent with lung origin and no actionable mutations on standard tumor molecular profiling. Palliative systemic therapy with carboplatin, pemetrexed, and pembrolizumab administered intravenously every 21 days was commenced. Imaging following the first two cycles of therapy showed stable disease.

The patient had a past medical history remarkable for invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast treated with lumpectomy followed by an aromatase inhibitor, which was diagnosed eight months prior to the lung cancer. She had a prior 20 pack-year tobacco use history, but had ceased smoking 35 years ago. She had recently traveled to the Southwest United States. She had no known occupational or environmental exposures. Notably, there was no history of chest radiation.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors are known to cause a variety of immune-related adverse events, including pneumonitis. After treatment with high-dose corticosteroids failed to produce a response, a course of intravenous immunoglobulin catalyzed rapid and durable improvement.
