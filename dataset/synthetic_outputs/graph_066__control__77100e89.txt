A 59-year-old woman presented with a cough and underwent a lung CT scan, which revealed a 52x53 mm space-occupying lesion in the left lower lobe, accompanied by peripheral obstructive inflammation, atelectasis, and multiple enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. Lung cancer with hilar lymph node metastasis was diagnosed following consultation with a multidisciplinary team (MDT), who determined that R0 resection was not possible. A lung puncture biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of keratinized squamous cell carcinoma. Immunohistochemical staining showed positivity for CK5/6, P63, P40, and Ki-67 (10% positivity), and negativity for Napsin A and CK7. The patient was diagnosed with left lower lobe squamous cell carcinoma (T3N2bM0, IIIB, clinical stage). Subsequently, she received six cycles of albumin-bound paclitaxel (100 mg/m² on day 1, day 8, and day 15), cisplatin (75 mg/m² on day 1), and carrelizumab (200 mg on day 1). During this treatment, the patient experienced some common side effects, which were successfully alleviated with conventional methods. The patient’s lung tumor gradually shrank. After completing six cycles of chemotherapy plus immunotherapy, a chest CT reexamination revealed that the left lower lung lesion had significantly reduced to approximately 23x25 mm, while the lymph nodes remained visible.
