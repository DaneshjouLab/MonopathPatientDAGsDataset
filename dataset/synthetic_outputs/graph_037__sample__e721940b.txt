A 62-year-old patient with a history of deep vein thrombosis, hypertension, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and a 20 pack-year smoking history (quit 20 years ago) was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma after a supraclavicular lymph node biopsy. On admission, the patient's performance status was 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale. Thoracic CT revealed a 46 × 47 mm mass in the second and sixth segments of the left lung, with multiple metastases in both lungs, and bilateral supraclavicular, subcarinal, and hilar lymphadenopathy.

Over the two months prior to diagnosis, the patient complained of dyspnea on exertion and a dry cough. They also reported a weight loss of 4 kg over six months. Auscultation revealed basilar crackles on the left side. The adenocarcinoma diagnosis was confirmed (CKAE/AE3+, CK7+, TTF-1+).

EGFR variant testing (cobasEGFRmutation test v2 assay) was negative. ALK protein expression immunohistochemistry (VENTANA ALK CloneD5F3) was negative. ROS1 rearrangement FISH (ZytoLight FISH-Tissue Implementation Kit and SpecROS1Dual Color Break Apart Probe) was also negative.

PD-L1 expression was found on 20% of tumor cells (TPS) using Ventana antibody. A thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic CT with contrast (RECIST 1.1 criteria) showed target lesions: a tumor in the left hilum measuring 46 mm, right hilar lymph nodes measuring 47 mm, and a celiac lymph node measuring 17 mm, with a sum of the longest diameter (SLD) of 110 mm. Nontarget lesions included enlarged subcarinal, upper and lower paratracheal lymph nodes; multiple lung nodules; ground glass opacities, septal thickening, and small nodules with perilymphatic distribution.

A subsegmental pulmonary embolism was revealed, and the patient was started on an anticoagulant. A cranial CT revealed no abnormalities. The disease clinical stage was initially classified as IVA (cT2bN3M1a) by the 8th Edition of TNM UICC.

The patient was started on immunochemotherapy with cisplatin, pemetrexed, and pembrolizumab for 4 induction courses, followed by pembrolizumab and pemetrexed continuation.

A thoracic CT scan after 3 months of treatment showed a partial response (SLD 63 mm). Treatment continued for a total of 11 courses.

Subsequent CT scans (every 3 months) showed an initial partial response (SLD 63 mm) then progressive disease (SLD 76 mm).

Treatment with cisplatin, pemetrexed, and pembrolizumab was discontinued due to progressive disease. A supraclavicular biopsy was performed with RNA-based targeted NGS analysis (FusionPlex®Lung v2). An EGFR exon 19 variant was detected (NM_005228.5:c.2236_2253delinsATT p.Glu746_Thr751delinsIle). No ALK; NTRK1; NTRK2; NTRK3; RET; ROS1 fusions; MET exon 14 skipping; BRAF, ERBB2, KRAS single-nucleotide polymorphisms; or insertions/deletions were observed.
