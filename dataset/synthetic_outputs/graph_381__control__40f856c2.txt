A patient presented with dyspnea, nonproductive cough, thoracic pain, and wheezing. Initial investigations included a complete metabolic panel, hemoglobin and platelet counts, N-terminal pro-b-type natriuretic peptide, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate measurements. A CT scan revealed a heterogeneous mass-like consolidation causing bronchi occlusion in the lung.

Bronchoscopy was performed, and a biopsy was taken from the lung mass. Initial pathology suggested a spindle cell sarcoma with leiomyosarcomatous features. Immunohistochemistry was performed, evaluating for desmin. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was also conducted, revealing murine double minute 2 (MDM2) translocation and MDM2 gene amplification. The final diagnosis was dedifferentiated liposarcoma of the lung, confirmed by the presence of lipoblasts on biopsy.

The patient underwent tumor cryoprobe debulking via bronchoscopy to alleviate the airway obstruction. Surgical intervention, including resection and ultimately pneumonectomy, was performed. Adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy were administered to address potential metastases.

The patient also had a history of menorrhagia and uterine leiomyomata, for which a hysterectomy was performed. Additionally, the patient had a thyroid Hurthle cell neoplasm. The lung mass was initially suspected to be a solitary lung mass or another form of malignancy before the final diagnosis of dedifferentiated liposarcoma was established.
