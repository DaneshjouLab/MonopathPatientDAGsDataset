A 67-year-old woman with locally advanced EGFRm NSCLC (exon 19 mutation) was treated with lobectomy, mediastinal node dissection, and 4 cycles of adjuvant cisplatin and vinorelbine. She declined brain radiation therapy or surgery and began treatment with afatinib. Three months later her brain lesion progressed radiographically, though she remained asymptomatic, and a decision was made to proceed with surgical resection. She was treated with whole-brain radiation (WBRT) and continued afatinib.

A 62-year-old man with early-stage EGFRm NSCLC (exon 19 deletion) was initially treated with a left lower lobectomy. Thirty-four months later, he developed pulmonary metastases and began treatment with gefitinib. He was treated with WBRT and continued gefitinib. The FLIP lesion was targeted with focal radiation therapy, and 3 months later, MR imaging showed stable disease.

A 49-year-old man with early-stage EGFRm NSCLC (exon 20 mutation) was treated with lobectomy. He was treated with WBRT followed by carboplatin and pemetrexed, and his hemiparesis resolved. The lesion was treated with salvage stereotactic radiosurgery; however, an MR imaging 3 months later showed progression. During that same period, he progressed extracranially and began treatment with pembrolizumab.
