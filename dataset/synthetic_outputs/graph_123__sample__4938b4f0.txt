A 72-year-old former smoker with cT2aN3M1c stage IVB lung squamous cell carcinoma presented with dyspnea and cough. The patient reached complete response to pembrolizumab treatment but suffered from grade 2 chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIP). Pembrolizumab treatment was discontinued due to pembrolizumab-related pneumonitis. The patient was then started on prednisolone (PSL, 50 mg/day). CIP was partially relieved by steroid treatment. The steroid dose was reduced by 5-10 mg every 2 weeks and finally reduced to 5 mg/day. On admission, the patient was hypoxemic (SpO2 88% at room air) but had no fever. Blood tests revealed high white blood cell (WBC) (12,900/μL) and C-reactive protein (CRP) (15.1 mg/dL) levels. Serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LD) and Krebs von den Lungen (KL)-6 were normal. Serological tests for autoantibodies against specific antigens were all negative. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed new bilateral diffuse infiltrative and ground-glass opacification in both lung fields, with partial attenuation of a previous infiltrative shadow in the right upper lobe. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was negative for microbes. Histological examination of a transbronchial lung biopsy specimen revealed organization and lymphocyte infiltration in the alveolar spaces. No malignant findings were observed. The patient was diagnosed with grade 3 ICI-related steroid-refractory organizing pneumonia caused by pembrolizumab. Chest CT 3 months before admission showed consolidation and ground-glass opacities with an air.
