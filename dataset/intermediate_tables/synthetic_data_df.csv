The patient reported no prior Antitubercular treatment (ATT) and had a history of tobacco chewing for over 20 years. Physical examination revealed decreased air entry on the right side of the lung.

Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of the thorax revealed a heterogeneous lesion in the mediastinal region abutting the horizontal fissure with cavitation. Chest imaging also showed multiple centrilobular nodules arranged in a linear branching pattern.

To investigate the lesion, bronchoscopy with bronchoscopic-guided biopsy and Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed. BAL fluid was negative for malignant cells, but the biopsy was suggestive of squamous cell carcinoma.

The patient subsequently reported decreased and blurring of vision. An ophthalmology opinion was obtained, which was within normal limits.

An 18F-FDG PET/CT scan was performed to assess the extent of the disease. The scan revealed an FDG-avid well-defined soft tissue primary mass measuring 5.6 cm x 7.7 cm x 8.3 cm with spiculated margins in the upper lobe of the right lung with collapse and consolidation of the right lung. FDG avid metastases to mediastinal, abdominopelvic lymph nodes and right-sided pleural deposits with multiple sub-centimetric to centimetric-sized bilateral lung nodules were noted. Multiple FDG avid brain lesions involving the bilateral cerebral cortex, cerebellum and pituitary were also identified. The PET/CT scan also showed FDG avid bilateral hypodense renal masses (largest measuring 2.8 cm x 2.6 cm), multiple lytic skeletal lesions with soft tissue component involvement, FDG-avid right-sided lung mass with abdominal lymph node, and FDG-avid soft tissue lesion in the pituitary. Another peripheral enhancing hypodense soft tissue lesion was noted in the left cerebral hemisphere. CT and fused PET/CT axial images showed a right parietal-occipital bone lytic lesion with soft tissue component involvement. Metabolically active soft tissue lesions were noted involving bilateral kidneys with extensive metastasis.

She underwent a right middle and lower lobectomy with systematic lymph node dissection and chest tube placement at an outside hospital. Intraoperatively, a tumor approximately 4 cm x 3 cm was found at the opening of the right lower lobe bronchus. Postoperative pathology revealed poorly differentiated large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) with metastasis to lymph node groups 3, 7, and 11. The tumor stage was T2aN2M0, stage IIIA.

Histopathological examination using hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining led to the diagnosis of large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed the following results: TTF-1 (+), Napsin A (-), Vimentin (-), CKp (+), CK5/6 (-), CK7 (+), P40 (-), Syn (+), CgA (+), CD56 (+), Ki-67 (proliferation index: 60%), and ALK (+).

graph_003,True,"A 73-year-old male patient was admitted to the emergency department with dyspnea and severe edema in the lower extremities. He had been diagnosed with extensive small-cell lung cancer 15 months previously. Contrast-enhanced CT revealed suprahepatic compression of the inferior vena cava (IVC) at the level of its entry into the right atrium, caused by a space-occupying, infiltrating right lung lesion. This resulted in Inferior vena cava syndrome (IVCS), which occurs after obstruction of venous flow through the IVC. Trunk and lower limb edema are the most common manifestations of this syndrome, and cardiac function may be compromised in more severe cases. Given the patient's performance status, disease stage, and symptom acuity, endovascular stenting of the IVC was preferred over surgery or radiotherapy. The superior vena cava (SVC)-to-IVC bridging stent approach was employed to address the severe mass effect and location of the IVC stenosis at its junction with the right atrium. Three uncovered self-expandable stents were deployed in tandem from the SVC to the IVC. Overlap between stents minimized the risk of collapse within the right atrium, possibly leading to cardiac conduction disorders or even perforation of the heart wall. The patient experienced alleviation of IVCS symptoms over the next 48 h but unfortunately passed away 8 days later from his primary disease.

graph_003,False,"A 73-year-old male with a history of extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), diagnosed 15 months prior, presented to the emergency department with dyspnea, abdominal distension, and lower-extremity edema due to severe IVC stenosis. The patient had received 6 cycles of carboplatin/etoposide chemotherapy, followed by thoracic radiotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation. He had also experienced a 20 kg weight loss within the past 12 months.

Upon presentation, the patient's ECOG performance status was 4. Vital signs were: BP 100/70 mmHg, HR 90 bpm, SpO2 89%, and Temp 36.9°C. Laboratory results included: Hemoglobin 12.6 g/dL, platelets 260 x 10^3/μL, alkaline phosphatase 94 U/L, ALT 40 U/L, AST 34 U/L, total bilirubin 0.88 mg/dL, and INR 1.3. A CT scan of the chest and abdomen revealed a heterogeneously enhancing mass in the right lower and middle lung (17.6 cm), mostly solid with large necrotic areas, multiple enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, infiltration of the visceral pleura and right hemidiaphragm, ascites, and peritoneal metastases. Significant compression and stenosis of the suprahepatic segment of the IVC prior to insertion into the right atrium (RA) was also noted. The large tumor involving the right lower and middle lung lobe measured (17.6 x 19.3 x 18.6) mm (maximal axial x coronal x sagittal dimension), which caused significant compression of the IVC.

Due to the IVC stenosis, an endovascular intervention was planned, and written informed consent was obtained. A 5F sheath was inserted into the right basilic vein and a 10F sheath into the right common femoral vein under local anesthesia. Venography showed significant compression of the suprahepatic IVC.

The IVC stenosis was passed using a 0.035-inch hydrophilic guidewire and a multipurpose catheter. Mechanical thrombectomy was performed, but no thrombotic material was extracted. A stiffer exchange guidewire was placed with its distal tip positioned in the right subclavian vein. Three uncovered self-expanding nitinol sinus-XL stents (OptiMed, Ettlingen, Germany) were deployed in tandem from the SVC to the IVC with overlap. Stent sizes were: 18 × 80 mm, 18 × 60 mm, and 16 × 80 mm, placed in a cephalic-to-caudal orientation.

Final venography revealed adequate flow through the vena cava and bridging stents. Digital venography illustrated significant stenosis of the suprahepatic inferior vena cava (IVC) due to compression. Low-molecular-weight heparin was administered.

Following the intervention, the patient's IVCS symptoms, mainly trunk and lower limb edema, were significantly alleviated within 48 hours. However, the patient died 8 days later from his primary disease (SCLC)."

Additional symptoms included cough and back pain. Chest computed tomography (CT) imaging revealed a large left-sided pleural effusion. Contrast-enhanced imaging demonstrated irregular enhancement patterns suggestive of a left lung tumor. Pulmonary window analysis identified multiple nodular high-density foci scattered across both lungs, raising suspicion for bilateral pulmonary metastases. Mediastinal window assessment further revealed bilateral mediastinal lymphadenopathy and enlarged lymph nodes at the left pulmonary hilum, consistent with lymph node metastasis. An abdominal CT scan detected multiple low-density hepatic nodules of varying sizes, with the largest lesion (2.9 cm × 2.6 cm) located in the right hepatic lobe. Annular enhancement was noted in the arterial phase, while marked hypodensity was observed in the portal venous phase, demonstrating a “bull’s eye sign” characteristic of multiple hepatic metastases. Additionally, an enhanced brain CT identified an irregular heterogeneously enhancing mass within the right frontal lobe, with a maximum cross-sectional area of 2.1 cm × 1.6 cm, consistent with brain metastasis. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining ruled out malignant mesothelioma, epithelioid sarcoma, plasmacytoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Based on the integration of IHC findings and morphological features, a pathologic diagnosis of INI-1-deficient undifferentiated carcinoma was established. Further analysis of the pleural effusion identified an EGFR 19del mutation. Correlating the imaging findings with the pathologic diagnosis, the clinical assessment confirmed metastatic INI-1-deficient undifferentiated carcinoma of the left lung, associated with malignant pleural effusion, bilateral pulmonary metastases, pleural involvement, multiple hepatic metastases, brain metastasis, and extensive mediastinal lymphadenopathy.

Histopathological findings revealed multiple papillary thyroid microcarcinomas (pT1a [m], pEx0, pN1b 4/10, pStage IVA) with negative surgical margins. Two years ago, a nodule in the right upper lobe of the lung was identified and followed up with chest CT scans. Based on these findings, the patient was suspected of having primary lung cancer. The diagnosis of adenocarcinoma was confirmed, and a right upper lobectomy with mediastinal lymph node dissection (ND-1b) was performed. The histopathological examination findings revealed atypical cells with hyperchromatic nuclei of variable sizes and eosinophilic cytoplasm, proliferating in papillary, acinar, micropapillary, and lepidic patterns. The findings were consistent with papillary adenocarcinoma (papillary 60%, acinar 20%, micropapillary 10%, lepidic 10%; WHO Grade 2), leading to a diagnosis of secondary lung cancer (pT1cN0cM0, pStage IA3). Additionally, scattered clusters of tumor cells with nuclear grooves, intranuclear inclusions, and ground-glass nuclei, proliferating in a papillary pattern, were observed near the secondary lung cancer. Immunohistochemistry showed thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) positivity, paired box 8 (PAX8) positivity, and thyroglobulin positivity. Similar findings were observed in the resected right upper lobe specimen, suggesting multiple pulmonary metastases from PTC.

An initial MRI performed two months after the NSCLC diagnosis was unremarkable. One year later, the patient presented to the emergency department with neurological weakness. A follow-up CT scan revealed metastatic spread throughout the brain.

A CT head showed multifocal intracranial lesions with vasogenic edema, indicative of metastases. The patient was admitted to the hospital and started on dexamethasone 4 mg twice daily, along with continued treatment for hypokalemia. Neutropenic precautions were initiated, with orders to start an infectious protocol and broad-spectrum antibiotics if the temperature exceeded 100.4°F. Pantoprazole and enoxaparin sodium were initiated for gastrointestinal and deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, respectively.

An MRI confirmed multiple new brain metastases with vasogenic edema and possible hemorrhagic components. The oncologist was consulted and confirmed metastasis to the brain and bone. Dexamethasone was increased to 6 mg every eight hours. Enoxaparin sodium was discontinued due to possible hemorrhages, and mechanical prophylaxis was started with thromboembolic deterrent stockings and sequential compression devices. The patient was discharged home and began whole brain external radiation therapy dosed at 30 Gy over 10 fractions, while docetaxel was held.

The patient tolerated radiation therapy well, and docetaxel was re-initiated. However, subsequent CT scans revealed new developments in the liver and possibly the pancreas, indicating refractory disease to second-line docetaxel. The oncologist discussed a third-line option and recommended hospice care. A brain MRI displayed numerous intracranial lesions involving bilateral cerebral hemispheres, including lesions in the anterior right frontal lobe, left frontoparietal region, and left temporal lobe, with multiple smaller lesions scattered throughout."
graph_013,True,"A patient with advanced-stage lung carcinoma presented with neurological symptoms. The primary concern was differentiating between stroke and brain metastasis. Metastasis, particularly to the brain, is a significant contributor to mortality and morbidity in advanced lung cancer, often rendering the disease incurable upon discovery. The clinical course involved repeated evaluations to distinguish between stroke and brain metastasis, as both conditions can present with similar neurological deficits. The diagnostic and therapeutic approach focused on differentiating these two conditions to optimize treatment strategies.

graph_015,True,"A 76-year-old male with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the lung developed obstructive shock and a transient ischemic attack (TIA) due to intracardiac metastasis. The patient presented with hemodynamic instability and a fall. A TIA with right facial droop and left pronator drift developed, which resolved within six hours. Given his poor performance status (ECOG 3), he was started on palliative radiation therapy and discharged to hospice care. Intracardiac metastasis, a rare complication of lung cancer, led to severe hemodynamic issues and neurological events like stroke. In this case, the tumor thrombus caused obstructive shock and increased the risk of ischemic stroke. Cancer-associated stroke is more common in patients with thoracic malignancies, underscoring the need for a multidisciplinary approach to manage these complex cases.

graph_016,False,"A 51-year-old female patient (born in 1970) presented in April 2013 with a subsolid pulmonary lesion incidentally detected during a routine follow-up for malignant melanoma. The patient had previously undergone resection of malignant melanoma. During this time, a suspicious lymph node in the left axilla was detected on ultrasound. Biopsy confirmed a metastasis of malignant melanoma in the left axillary lymph node, which was also confirmed by PET/CT as a solitary finding in the left axilla. In late April 2013, the patient underwent a left axillary dissection, revealing 1 of 19 lymph nodes with metastasis. Molecular genetic testing revealed a BRAF mutation at codon 600, and targeted therapy with BRAF inhibitors was initiated. Follow-up at another institution assessed the disease as stable. In November 2017, a routine CT scan of the lungs detected a new asymptomatic 7 mm lesion in segment S10 of the right lower lobe, with a density consistent with a pure ground glass nodule. A follow-up CT scan in June 2020 showed the lesion changed character to a subsolid lesion with the presence of a solid component. A PET/CT scan in July 2020 confirmed the persistence of the lesion without increased metabolic activity. By April 2021, follow-up confirmed persistence and slight size progression of the solid component of the lesion, with a lesion size of 12 mm and a solid component of 7 mm. In May 2021, the patient was indicated by the multidisciplinary pulmonary committee for surgical resection.

graph_018,False,"A 52-year-old male, diagnosed with primary lung adenocarcinoma in 2023, presented with severe, debilitating shoulder pain (VAS 9) in the low dorsal area. This prompted a CT scan, which revealed a compression fracture of the T8 vertebral body with multiple fracture lines and a mixed lytic-sclerotic tumor component, with the lytic aspect being more prominent in the anterior portion of the vertebral body. The CT scan also showed mild posterior wall prominence without significant stenosis of the vertebral canal. Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with a pathological fracture of the T8 vertebra due to metastasis. The patient was treated with microwave ablation and the SpineJack system due to an isolated, irregular compression fracture. An initial CT scan was performed to assess the lesion’s size, location, and radiological characteristics. The patient was positioned prone, and conscious sedation was administered using continuous intravenous infusion of fentanyl citrate (0.1 mg/2 mL diluted 1:10 with saline). Lidocaine (1–2%) was administered subcutaneously at the incision site using a 22-gauge intramuscular needle.

Abdominal computed tomography revealed diffuse dilatation and gas accumulation in the bowel, indicative of an incomplete intestinal obstruction. Gastroscopy showed chronic atrophic gastritis (C2) with bile reflux. Colonoscopy revealed a subpedunculated polyp approximately 1.5 cm in size, 20 cm from the anus, with smooth mucosa in the sigmoid colon. The colonoscopy also examined the descending colon at 40 cm, where the mucosa and colonic haustra were smooth; however, due to severe pain and copious dry feces, the procedure was terminated.

Laparoscopic exploration and mesenteric lymph node biopsy were performed, revealing significant bowel dilation and gas accumulation with no evidence of small bowel tumors or inflammatory diseases. Slight swelling of the small bowel mesentery and numerous enlarged lymph nodes were observed. Pathological examination of the lymph nodes revealed reactive hyperplasia.

The patient was diagnosed with a functional gastrointestinal disorder, later determined to be ICI-related GIPO (gastrointestinal immune-related adverse event). The patient tested positive for anti-Hu antibodies, leading to a diagnosis of anti-Hu antibody-related GIPO induced by serplulimab.

Treatment included intravenous methylprednisolone sodium succinate, but this provided no symptom relief. High-dose steroid pulse therapy was then administered. Ultimately, the patient died. An autopsy was performed.

In April 2021, the patient was diagnosed with HIV infection, with an HIV-1 RNA level of 1.04 x 10^5 copies/mL and a CD4+ T cell count of 64.66 cells/µL. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) was initiated in May 2021, consisting of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, lamivudine, and efavirenz.

By February 2023, the patient's HIV-1 RNA level had decreased to 113 copies/mL, and the CD4+ T cell count had improved to 283 cells/µL. However, low-level viremia persisted. Genotypic resistance testing revealed a K103N mutation. Medication adherence assessment showed an 82% self-reported adherence rate.

In August 2023, chest imaging revealed a left lung mass, which was confirmed as lung squamous cell carcinoma with 40% PD-L1 expression. Contrast-enhanced chest CT demonstrated a left hilar tumor measuring 89 mm × 66 mm, multiple pulmonary nodules, and evidence of hepatic metastases, corresponding to stage IVB (cT4N2M1c) disease.

In November 2023, the patient began combination therapy with carboplatin (AUC 5, day 1) and paclitaxel (175 mg/m², day 1) administered in 21-day cycles, combined with pembrolizumab (200 mg, day 1). The patient subsequently developed Grade 3 myelosuppression (neutrophil count 0.8 × 10^9/L) and Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy.

Also in November 2023, the patient's HIV-1 RNA increased to 233 copies/mL, and the CD4+ T cell count declined to 22.82 cells/µL. The antiretroviral regimen was modified to incorporate albuvirtide (320 mg per dose, administered on days 1, 2, 3, and 8, followed by weekly maintenance doses) in combination with efavirenz, lamivudine, and tenofovir alafenamide. Due to chemotherapy intolerance, the cancer treatment was adjusted to PD-1 inhibitor monotherapy.

The absolute neutrophil count (ANC) recovered from the lowest value of 0.8 × 10^9/L to 1.6 × 10^9/L. Hepatic function parameters were within normal range (ALT 32–45 U/L and AST 28–39 U/L)."
graph_021,True,"People living with HIV (PLWH) who experience low-level viremia (LLV) face unique challenges in disease management, particularly when diagnosed with concurrent malignancies. Albuvirtide (ABT), a long-acting HIV fusion inhibitor approved in China, has shown promise in clinical trials for treatment-experienced individuals. However, its efficacy in managing LLV in the context of concurrent malignancies remains under-explored.

This report describes two cases of PLWH with LLV who developed non-AIDS-defining cancers (NADCs). The first individual developed lung squamous cell carcinoma, and the second was diagnosed with breast cancer. Both patients received ABT as part of their optimized antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen during their cancer treatment course. After treatment optimization, both cases achieved viral suppression (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL) with improvements in CD4+ T cell counts. Both patients received appropriate cancer treatments according to clinical practice guidelines. The patient diagnosed with lung cancer required an adjustment to his PD-1 inhibitor monotherapy due to intolerance to chemotherapy, whereas the breast cancer patient successfully completed her planned multimodal treatment regimen.

These cases suggest potential benefits of ABT-containing ART regimens in PLWH who have LLV and concurrent NADCs. While two cases cannot establish definitive conclusions, they highlight the need for larger studies investigating the role of ABT in this complex clinical scenario.

Laboratory tests showed normal Span-1 and DUPAN2 levels, but elevated ProGRP (698 pg/mL) and NSE (31.1 ng/mL). Pure-tone audiometry (PTA) revealed bilateral mixed hearing loss, averaging 72.5 dB in the right ear and 78.8 dB in the left ear (500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz).

Biopsies were obtained from the EAC mass, lung mass, and pancreatic mass to differentiate between primary and metastatic EAC carcinoma. The red mass occupied the external auditory canal before chemotherapy. Computed tomography findings showed a mass in the right upper lobe of the lung and a mass in the pancreatic body. Destruction of the left mastoid was also noted.

Pathology from all lesions revealed small cell tumors with a high nuclear\u2010to\u2010cytoplasmic ratio on Hematoxylin and eosin staining. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated positivity for synaptophysin, chromogranin A, and cytokeratin AE1/3, whereas CK20 was negative in all lesions. Biopsy specimens confirmed small cell lung cancer (SCLC), and thyroid transcription factor\u20101 (TTF\u20101) positivity in the EAC and pancreatic lesions suggested a primary tumor in the lung.

Positron emission tomography-CT (PET-CT) showed right upper lung cancer with multiple tiny nodules in both lungs, suspected to be metastatic foci. Aspiration biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the right lung. The right upper lung nodule was further diagnosed as lung adenocarcinoma (PD-L1 TPS=2%) by computed tomography (CT)-guided puncture.

During the same period, thyroid nodules were detected by ultrasound and puncture, and papillary thyroid cancer was confirmed by pathology. Abnormal ultrasound of lymph nodes in the V region of the neck, with puncture suggesting a spindle cell soft tissue tumor, prompted a multidisciplinary team to evaluate the case.

After chemotherapy and targeted therapy, multidisciplinary evaluation ruled out the possibility of lung metastasis. Puncture pathology of the supraclavicular mass favored the diagnosis of myxoinflammatory fibroblastic sarcoma (MIFS). Ultimately, the patient underwent radical surgery, including resection of the upper lobe of the right lung, systematic lymph node dissection, and enlarged resection of the neck mass.

This case highlights the potential for misdiagnosis of supraclavicular masses in patients with lung cancer, emphasizing the importance of considering non-metastatic lesions and the crucial role of multidisciplinary collaboration and precise pathological diagnosis in differentiating complex tumors.

Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed on biopsies from 2022 (initial RML lesion) and 2024 (new RUL lesion), revealing significant molecular evolution over time, with a marked increase in single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and copy number variants (CNVs) and distinct changes in key mutations such as ALK-EML4 and EGFR.

The patient received stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for the new RUL lesion while continuing alectinib. This resulted in significant improvement, which has been maintained until the time of this report.

This case represents the first documented occurrence of metachronous L858R and T790M EGFR mutations following ALK inhibitor therapy, highlighting the emergence of distinct driver mutations over time and reflecting temporal and spatial tumor heterogeneity.

graph_027,True,"A 74-year-old man with a history of lung cancer was admitted to the hospital on January 9, 2024, due to blood in the stool. He presented to the emergency department with a 5-hour history of black stools, reporting three large bowel movements of black stool without vomiting blood. He also reported panic, weakness, and no abdominal pain or distension. Initial assessment revealed a hemoglobin level of 58 g/L, indicating active bleeding. He was diagnosed with acute upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage.

The patient was admitted to the gastroenterology department and treated with blood transfusions, fluid supplementation, hemostasis, and acidic gastric protection. A CT scan of the chest and abdomen revealed localized thickening of the small bowel wall in the left lower abdomen with multiple surrounding lymph nodes, suggesting small bowel occupancy with peripheral lymph node metastasis. Oral small bowel imaging showed gastritis, but no significant abnormalities in the jejunum, ileum, and ileocecum region. Double-balloon enteroscopy revealed small bowel occupation and bleeding, along with submucosal elevation, possibly representing lipoma. Esophageal lesions were diagnosed as non-atrophic gastritis.

Immunohistochemistry results showed P53 (wild type expression), Ki67 (basal high expression), SMARCA4 (deletion), CK7 (+), TTF-1 (-), Napsin A (-), SPA (-), SP-B (-), CK20 (-), Villin (focal +), CDX-2 (-), SATB2 (individually weakly plus), CK5/6 (-), P40 (-), and Ki67 (+ 65%). These findings supported a diagnosis of small bowel metastasis from lung adenocarcinoma causing gastrointestinal bleeding.

On January 20, 2024, the patient underwent laparoscopic radical resection for small bowel cancer. During surgery, a small bowel tumor was found 200 cm from the beginning of the jejunum. The distal lumen of the small bowel and lumen of the colon were covered with black blood, confirming gastrointestinal hemorrhage.

Currently, the patient's overall condition is good, and he is undergoing combined chemotherapy. The long-term prognosis remains to be observed and followed.

Thoracoscopic wedge resection of the right upper and lower lung nodule was performed under general anesthesia. Postoperative pathology revealed invasive adenocarcinoma in the upper lobe of the right lung, with two masses that did not invade the lung membranes, and no cancerous involvement of the anastomotic margins. The lower lobe of the right lung showed microinvasive adenocarcinoma without invasion of the lung membranes, and no cancer involvement at the anastomotic end margins.

Four years later, the patient, with a history of right lung cancer surgery, was found to have a nodule in the right lung that had increased in size over the past 3 days compared with the previous one. Complete blood examination revealed no significant abnormalities. A CT-guided percutaneous lung nodule aspiration biopsy was performed on July 28, 2023. Thermal ablation of the lung nodule was performed under local anesthesia on August 8, 2023. Regular follow-up chest CT scans of the upper and middle lobe lesions in the right lung were conducted, alongside thermal ablation treatment to reduce the lesions compared to those of the previous scan.

On January 9, 2024, the patient was admitted to the emergency department for acute upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage after having 3 black stools for 5 hours, large in total amount, without vomiting blood, accompanied by obvious panic and weakness, without fainting, and without abdominal pain and distension.

graph_029,True,"A 65-year-old woman was diagnosed with extensive-disease small cell lung cancer (ED-SCLC). The initial treatment plan involved durvalumab and etoposide. However, during the first course of treatment, specifically on day 1 during an etoposide infusion, the patient experienced anaphylactic shock. Following the administration of durvalumab, etoposide was discontinued due to an anaphylactic reaction immediately after its initiation. The patient was unable to continue the same regimen and was switched to cisplatin and irinotecan therapy. A FoundationOne panel test was submitted, and TMB-high was detected. After four courses of cisplatin and irinotecan therapy, pembrolizumab was introduced, and a complete response (CR) was maintained for 18 months. One week after initiating Pembrolizumab treatment, the patient developed papules and pustules on both palms and soles. This was diagnosed as an exacerbation of the patient’s pre-existing palmoplantar pustulosis. The patient achieved long-term remission lasting over 18 months with pembrolizumab treatment.

Biopsy specimens from both the lung mass and the breast mass revealed small cell carcinoma (SCLC) in both lesions. The breast mass was determined to be a metastatic lesion from primary SCLC. Comprehensive staging, including contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain and FDG-PET, led to a diagnosis of stage cT2aN3M1c. PET-CT scan revealed multiple bone metastases, peritoneal metastases, and skin metastases in addition to the primary lesion in the right upper lobe and the right breast. Enhanced chest CT examination revealed a primary lesion in the right upper lobe, as well as a heterogeneous mass in the right breast. Histological analysis revealed diffuse proliferation of small tumor cells with a high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic (N/C) ratio on Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining. Immunohistochemistry showed Synaptophysin staining negative, Chromogranin staining negative, and INSM1 staining positive. First-line treatment was initiated with carboplatin (CBDCA), etoposide (ETP), and durvalumab, administered in the sequence of durvalumab, followed by ETP, and then CBDCA. During the first course of treatment, the patient experienced anaphylactic shock while receiving an ETP infusion on day 1. ETP administration was immediately discontinued. The anaphylactic shock was treated with cimetidine, dexamethasone, and chlorpheniramine, along with a saline infusion.

Her past medical history included breast cancer 10 years prior, treated with surgery and radiotherapy. Radiological suspicion arose for lipoid pneumonia, and the patient reported using a nasal decongestant (hypertonic solution at 2.2% with hyaluronic acid). The left lung consolidation progressed, becoming more solid, and was positive on PET-FDG. A bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed but yielded negative results. Subsequently, a fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) of the consolidation was performed and was positive for lipoid pneumonia. A chest CT scan revealed bilateral pseudonodular lesions consistent with lipoid pneumonia with low central attenuation. The right lower lobe lesion measured 21 mm x 16 mm x 18 mm with ground-glass changes, while the left lower lobe showed a 33 mm x 24 mm x 35 mm pseudonodular image with irregular margins. Bilateral lung lesions measured nearly 6 cm in the postero-basal segment of the left lower lobe adjacent to bronchiectasis and reticulum-nodular thickening of the interstitium. Following surgery, the patient stopped using the nasal decongestant. A subsequent chest CT scan showed a 15 mm middle lobe lesion with low central attenuation and adjacent interstitial thickening.

Coronary angiography confirmed stenosis, leading to percutaneous coronary intervention with stent placement.

Further investigation, possibly prompted by the recurrent cough and expectoration, revealed a peripheral lung cancer. A fine-needle aspiration confirmed lung adenocarcinoma. Genetic testing and immunoassay were performed to characterize the tumor. Positron emission tomography and bone scan revealed bone metastases, indicating advanced disease.

The patient was treated with bisphosphonates for anti-osteolysis and pain relief related to the bone metastases. Immunotherapy and radiotherapy were also initiated as part of the lung cancer treatment. The patient also had a history of pulmonary emphysema, interstitial lung disease, and herpes zoster.

graph_036,False,"The patient was born in 1945. At age 53, the patient was diagnosed with acquired von Willebrand syndrome (AVWS) after repeated episodes of lower gastrointestinal bleeding due to digestive angiodysplasia. The patient had no personal or family history of bleeding prior to diagnosis. Laboratory findings revealed a qualitative deficiency of VWF, with Factor VIII activity (FVIII:C) at 40%, VWF antigen (VWF:Ag) at 20%, and VWF activity using the ristocetin cofactor (VWF:Rco) less than 10%.

In 2005, etiological assessment for VWD revealed a low abundance IgM kappa monoclonal spike in serum protein electrophoresis. Biological diagnosis of AVWS was confirmed using advanced diagnostic techniques, including VWF multimer electrophoresis, revealing a loss of high-molecular-weight multimers (HMWMs) and a VWF propeptide-to-VWF: Ag ratio of 3.95 (normal range < 2.4) in a patient with group O blood. No antibodies against VWF were detected.

The patient received iterative transfusions for bleeding. Immunoglobulin infusions were ineffective. VWF concentrates administered showed mixed efficacy, with poor recovery and a short half-life. The patient underwent partial gastrectomy for fundic angiodysplasia, ileal resection, repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm complicated by hemorrhagic shock, electrocoagulation, and ethmoidectomy.

graph_036,True,"A 79-year-old male, born in 1945, with a prolonged history of recurrent lower gastrointestinal bleeding attributed to digestive angiodysplasia, which had persisted for over 30 years, was investigated. He was diagnosed with acquired von Willebrand syndrome (AVWS) at the age of 53, after experiencing repeated episodes of lower gastrointestinal bleeding due to digestive angiodysplasia. Notably, there was no personal or family history of bleeding prior to the diagnosis. Initial biological investigations revealed a qualitative deficiency of von Willebrand factor (VWF), with abnormal values for factor VIII activity (FVIII:C), VWF antigen (VWF:Ag), and VWF activity using the ristocetin cofactor (VWF:Rco), respectively, 40%, 20%, and <10% (normal range 50–150%).

For the first 10 years, the clinical picture was predominantly dominated by digestive bleeding. Thus, the patient was diagnosed with Heyde syndrome, defined by the triad of severe aortic stenosis, recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding due to angiodysplasia, and AVWS. In 2005, an etiological assessment for VWD revealed a low abundance IgM kappa monoclonal spike in serum protein electrophoresis, suggesting monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Simultaneously, the biological diagnosis of AVWS was confirmed using advanced diagnostic techniques, including VWF multimer electrophoresis. This revealed a loss of high-molecular-weight multimers (HMWMs) and a VWF propeptide-to-VWF:Ag ratio of 3.95 (normal range < 2.4) in a patient with group O blood, supporting the acquired etiology of the patient’s VWF deficiency. Furthermore, no antibodies against VWF were detected.

Therapeutically, in the event of bleeding, the patient received iterative transfusions, but immunoglobulin infusions were unsurprisingly ineffective, given the presence of an IgM spike. The various VWF concentrates administered showed mixed efficacy, with poor recovery and a short half-life. The patient underwent multiple major interventions, including partial gastrectomy for fundic angiodysplasia, ileal resection, repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm complicated by hemorrhagic shock, electrocoagulation, and ethmoidectomy.

Due to the onset of angina, a transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) was performed urgently in 2020, but this did not resolve the VWF deficit. In 2022, the patient was diagnosed with non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) harboring the KRAS G12C mutation and initiated second-line treatment with sotorasib. Notably, one year after the initiation of sotorasib therapy, the patient’s hemostasis had normalized, accompanied by significant improvements in VWF levels. VWF multimer electrophoresis demonstrated the restoration of high-molecular-weight multimers (HMWMs), and serum protein electrophoresis no longer detected MGUS. These improvements were likely attributable to the indirect effects of sotorasib on the bone marrow microenvironment. By inhibiting KRAS in stromal cells and osteoclasts, sotorasib may have disrupted the supportive niche necessary for malignant plasma cell survival, resulting in a reduction in the monoclonal spike. Unfortunately, the patient eventually succumbed to carcinogenic pleurisy.

On admission, the patient's performance status was 1 on the ECOG scale. He complained of dyspnea on exertion and a dry cough for two months. He had lost 4 kg of weight in six months. Auscultation revealed basilar crackles on the left side. A diagnostic workup of predictive biomarkers was ordered on the patient's histopathological specimens.

A diagnosis of adenocarcinoma was confirmed (CKAE/AE3+, CK7+, TTF-1+). DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue and tested for *EGFR* variants using the cobas *EGFR* mutation test v2 assay. Immunohistochemistry for *ALK* protein expression was performed using VENTANA ALK (CloneD5F3). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was carried out using the ZytoLight FISH-Tissue Implementation Kit and Spec *ROS1* Dual Color Break Apart Probe. No clinically relevant variants were found in any of these tests. PD-L1 was assessed using Ventana antibody, revealing expression on 20% of tumor cells (TPS).

Thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic CT with contrast, performed according to RECIST 1.1 criteria, revealed the following target lesions: a 46 mm tumor in the left hilum, 47 mm right hilar lymph nodes, and a 17 mm celiac lymph node, with a sum of length diameter (SLD) of 110 mm. Nontarget lesions included enlarged subcarinal lymph nodes; upper and lower paratracheal lymph nodes; multiple nodules in both lungs; and radiological features of lymph vessels invasion, namely ground glass opacities, septal thickening, and small nodules with perilymphatic distribution. Moreover, a subsegmental pulmonary embolism was revealed. The patient was started on an anticoagulant. A cranial CT revealed no abnormalities.

The disease clinical stage was initially classified as IVA (cT2bN3M1a) by the 8th Edition of TNM UICC. He commenced immunochemotherapy with a regimen of 4 induction courses of cisplatin, pemetrexed, pembrolizumab, and a continuation with pembrolizumab and subsequently pemetrexed.

The patient was stabilized with Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) intervention and initiated glucocorticoid reduction. The patient was tapered off methylprednisolone (80mg/day intravenously for ten days) over four months to stop new blister formation, along with topical ointment. Subsequently, the patient developed a pulmonary fungal infection, suspected to be related to prolonged glucocorticoid use. Initially, the patient received a TCM prescription with Yu-Ping-Feng. After a week of intravenous methylprednisolone sodium succinate, the patient developed thirst, self-consciousness of dryness and heat, hyperphagia, and irritability. Damp-dispelling herbs were removed to protect Yin, and herbs clearing the Qi system were replaced with Bubali Cornu and Sophorae Flavescentis Radix to enhance the removal of heat-toxin. Mori Cortex, Aurantii Fructus, and Ophiopogonis Radix were added.

graph_038,True,"A 70-year-old man with advanced squamous lung cancer developed dermatologic toxicities after receiving Pembrolizumab-based therapy. He presented with blisters and papules distributed covering 60% of the trunk and extremities, along with more than 90% coverage of the hands and feet, graded as a cutaneous immune-related adverse event (irAE) of 3–4 levels. The dermatologic toxicities were accompanied by pruritus, infections, hypercoagulation, hypoproteinemia, and electrolyte disturbance. During the acute phase, the patient was treated with an integrative treatment of intravenous glucocorticosteroids synchronized with traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) decoctions for seven days. This treatment effectively intercepted the appearance of fresh cutaneous lesions, with noticeable alleviation of pruritus and other complications. He then began to taper his glucocorticoid dosage with the assistance of TCM. Antihistamines and topicals were used in the first three weeks. As a result, the cutaneous symptoms were well controlled, and he was subsequently transferred for further anti-tumor therapies. The integrated glucocorticoids and TCM successfully brought the patient out of the acute phase of high-grade irAE dermatologic toxicity. The cutaneous symptoms were resolved more rapidly, with earlier glucocorticoid tapering and fewer adverse hormonal effects, without tumor progression.

graph_039,True,"A man in his 80s with comorbidities of hypertension, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease presented with shortness of breath. A chest CT scan revealed pleural effusion and a mass in the right lower lobe. The non-contrast chest CT scan showed a moderate amount of pleural effusion and a mass of 60x50x80 mm with heterogeneous internal density in the right lower lobe. He had high inflammatory reaction and was initially diagnosed as having pulmonary suppuration with empyema. He underwent antibiotic treatment. The diagnosis was pulmonary suppuration or lung cancer with infection, and surgical intervention was planned to control infection. Although the blood tests showed a decrease in inflammatory markers and the pleural effusion disappeared postoperatively, the thoracic mass continued to increase in size. High inflammatory reaction and pleural effusion caused by intratumoral infection made it difficult to distinguish from pulmonary suppuration before operation. Pathological examination, combined with clinical and radiological findings, led to the diagnosis of localized sarcoma-type malignant pleural mesothelioma. This case highlights a sarcomatoid-type LPM deriving from the visceral pleura that was preoperatively misdiagnosed as pulmonary suppuration because of high inflammatory reaction and pleural effusion.

A non-contrast chest CT scan confirmed a 60x50x80 mm mass with heterogeneous internal density in the right lower lobe, along with moderate pleural effusion. Initial blood work showed an elevated WBC count of 9130/\u00b5L and a CRP concentration of 2.5 mg/dL.

The patient was admitted to the hospital and underwent intercostal tube drainage. Cytological analysis of the pleural effusion, which was yellow and cloudy, was classified as class \u2161, leading to a diagnosis of pulmonary suppuration with empyema. Antibiotic treatment was initiated.

After two weeks of antibiotic treatment, the patient's inflammatory reaction worsened, with the WBC count increasing to 11160/\u00b5L and the CRP concentration rising to 13.0 mg/dL. Follow-up CT images showed an increase in the size of the mass.

After three weeks of antibiotic treatment with no improvement, the patient was referred to our department for surgical intervention. Blood examination at this time revealed a high inflammatory reaction, with a WBC count of 18500/\u00b5L and a CRP concentration of 25.41 mg/dL. Tumor markers (carcinoembryonic antigen, cytokeratin 19 fragment, and pro-gastrin-releasing peptide) and markers of infectious disease (tuberculosis, aspergillus, and fungus) were not elevated.

There were no complications during her procedure and her mediastinal lymph node biopsy confirmed metastatic renal cell carcinoma. However, 23 days after her procedure, she presented to the emergency department with sepsis and cardiac tamponade. Pericardial fluid cultures and computed tomography imaging confirmed polymicrobial pyogenic pericarditis and mediastinitis. While complications from EBUS-TBNA are rare, clinicians need to be aware that pericarditis and mediastinitis are possible life-threatening complications in order to facilitate early recognition and interventions.

Twenty-three days after undergoing EBUS-TBNA, the patient presented to the emergency department with hypotension, elevated leukocyte count, lactate, creatinine, and liver enzymes. The patient was not in respiratory distress and was in room air. A chest X-ray revealed new opacities in the left lower lung field, leading to a diagnosis of pneumosepsis. The patient subsequently developed unstable, narrow complex tachycardia. A bedside echocardiogram diagnosed a large pericardial effusion and features of tamponade. Emergent pericardiocentesis was performed with insertion of a pericardial drain and evacuation of 350 mL of purulent fluid. Pericardial fluid cytology was negative, but cultures grew Streptococcus mitis-group, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Prevotella melaninogenica, and Lancefieldella rimae. A repeat CT scan of the chest revealed a large loculated rim-enhancing fluid collection within the mediastinum and pericardium, with multiple internal locules of gas and thickening with enhancement in the pericardium and mediastinal soft tissue. The patient developed progressive septic shock due to the inability to obtain source control. The mediastinal fluid collection was not amenable to drainage via interventional radiology. HRCT of the chest at the level of the aortic arch demonstrated a large loculated fluid collection within the mediastinum, with the necrotic station 4R appearing indistinguishable from the collection. HRCT of the chest at the level of the carina showed visible mediastinal gas and loculations. HRCT of the chest also showed multiple internal locules of gas within the pericardial effusion, and HRCT of the lower chest demonstrated pericardial thickening and bilateral pleural effusions.

graph_041,False,"**Clinical Case Report**

In April 2021, a patient presented with recurrent lower abdominal pain that had persisted for 6 months. Initial gastrointestinal color Doppler ultrasound and abdominal CT at an external hospital suggested a space-occupying lesion in the small intestine, raising suspicion for a potential malignant tumor. Further investigation with contrast-enhanced abdominal CT at a tertiary (3A) hospital in Chongqing revealed thickening of the small intestinal wall in the left mid-to-lower abdomen, accompanied by mass formation and multiple surrounding lesions. This was suggestive of small intestinal malignancy with lymph node metastasis and possible pelvic peritoneal involvement. The patient reported no respiratory symptoms such as cough, sputum production, or shortness of breath. However, a comprehensive chest CT identified a space-occupying lesion in the apical-posterior segment of the left upper lobe, highly indicative of lung cancer, with enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes (stations 5 and 10L), suggesting potential metastasis. To confirm the diagnoses, needle biopsies were performed on the lung, mediastinal lymph nodes, and the small intestinal mass. All three lesions demonstrated features of high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma, with suspected small-cell carcinoma based on morphological and immunohistochemical (IHC) findings."

The patient received curative radiotherapy and IC chemotherapy, including carboplatin and irinotecan. Later, the disease progressed to extensive-stage SCLC.

During the course of the illness, the patient developed gastrointestinal metastases, specifically small intestinal metastasis. These metastases led to complications including intestinal obstruction and, ultimately, intestinal perforation. The intestinal perforation resulted in diffuse peritonitis.

The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy, ileal resection, and anastomosis to address the intestinal perforation and peritonitis. Intestinal necrosis was noted during the surgical procedure. Post-operatively, the patient developed leukopenia and was treated with the antibiotic piperacillin/tazobactam.

Due to the extensive-stage SCLC, the patient was considered for further treatment options, including immunotherapy. However, the gastrointestinal metastases were deemed unresectable. The patient also received prophylactic brain radiation therapy. A CT scan was performed to assess the extent of the disease. The patient experienced further episodes of gastrointestinal perforation and intussusception.

graph_043,True,"A 45-year-old female, a smoker for 25 years with no other comorbidities, and metastatic lung cancer developed colitis after the seventh cycle of pembrolizumab. Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICIs) like pembrolizumab, which target the PD-1 receptor of lymphocytes, can cause immune-related adverse events (irAEs) due to loss of immunoregulatory control. ICIs-induced colitis, a common irAE, typically develops 6–8 weeks after ICI initiation. The case highlights the importance of early recognition and intervention to prevent permanent interruption of checkpoint inhibitor treatment and colitis complications. Colonoscopy is recommended for patients with grade 2 or higher symptoms, along with systemic corticosteroids and potentially biologic therapy based on response. The colon mucosa may show normal macroscopic findings, but microscopically, immunotherapy-induced autoimmune colitis could be present. Colitis is an important IrAE and a leading cause of hospitalization and quality of life deterioration during ICI treatment.

graph_047,True,"Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 85% of lung cancer cases. Common metastatic sites include the liver, bones and adrenal glands, while intra-abdominal lymph node metastases (ALNM) are less frequently recognized and often underestimated. Gastrointestinal and intra-ALNM are rare but likely underdiagnosed, with hematogenous and lymphatic pathways, including the thoracic duct, playing key roles. ALNM occurs in 6%–11% of NSCLC patients, with the porta hepatis being an exceptionally rare site. Advanced staging and follow-up are crucial for detecting ALNM, as they impact prognosis and therapy. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) has shown superior sensitivity compared to CT in detecting extrathoracic metastases, influencing management in up to 25% of NSCLC cases.

The patient had a history of smoking 20 cigarettes per day until the age of 50 but had abstained for the past 16 years. CT imaging suggested lung cancer in the left lower lobe. PET-CT showed mild uptake in the left lower lobe mass, with no evidence of distant metastasis. Contrast-enhanced brain MRI showed no abnormalities suggestive of metastasis. Bronchoscopy was performed, but transbronchial lung biopsy and brushing/irrigation cytology yielded no evidence of malignancy. Based on these findings, stage IB primary lung cancer was suspected, and a surgical biopsy followed by lobectomy was planned. Intraoperative needle biopsy confirmed adenocarcinoma, leading to left lower lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node dissection. Immediately after chest wound closure, a large volume of air leakage was observed, along with pneumatocele formation and perforation on the mediastinal side of the upper lobe. Postoperatively, a mild air leak persisted, requiring a single session of adhesive therapy. Cases of pneumatocele formation following pulmonary resection are increasingly reported, yet its underlying pathogenesis and optimal treatment remain unclear. Lung fragility and increased negative intrathoracic pressure following resection are key risk factors for pneumatocele formation. While most cases can be managed conservatively, surgical intervention should be considered in symptomatic cases, particularly those presenting with pneumothorax or hemoptysis.

SMARCA4-deficient non-small cell lung cancer (SMARCA4-dNSCLC) typically lacks target-driven gene alterations and is primarily resistant to cytotoxic drugs. There is currently no standard treatment.

This case reports a chemotherapy-free strategy with tislelizumab and fruquintinib utilized as a first-line treatment for a patient with SMARCA4-deficient NSCLC. The patient achieved remarkable partial remission and lasted more than two years of disease control without severe adverse events.

In February 2022, a 67-year-old man with ECOG PS 1 who had smoked 1 pack per day for 40 years presented to the hospital for chest tightness. Physical examination showed left supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, about 1 cm in size. Chest CT examination revealed a mass of about 2 cm in size in the posterior basal segment of the left lower lobe, with multiple burrs on the edge and enhancement. Multiple lymph nodes in the mediastinum were enlarged and fused, surrounding the left main bronchus. To further clarify the diagnosis, a CT-guided lung puncture biopsy was performed on March 10, 2022. Preliminary pathology suggested poorly differentiated carcinoma.
The patient was treated with first-line tislelizumab combined with fruquintinib. The patient achieved remarkable partial remission and lasted more than two years of disease control without severe adverse events. Unfortunately, cervical lymph node progression occurred. The patient was subsequently treated with a combination of local radiotherapy and previous systemic therapy.

A 71-year-old male was diagnosed with left superior lobe squamous cell carcinoma (cT4N3Mx) on September 20, 2023.

From October to November 2023, the patient received radiotherapy for lung and mediastinal lesions, with a target dose of 54Gy and an average cardiac dose of 3.4Gy, achieving a partial response (PR).

From December 2023 to July 2024, the patient underwent 5 cycles of albumin-bound paclitaxel + cisplatin chemotherapy, among which the 4th cycle was combined with recombinant human endostatin (Endu). Due to cardiac reactions related to Endu, the treatment was not completed, and the efficacy was stable disease (SD).

In October 2024, the disease progressed, leading to gemcitabine and sintilimab treatment starting on October 21, 2024. Baseline assessment before immunotherapy: Myocardial injury markers and BNP were normal. ECG showed sinus rhythm, unbiased electrical axis, low extremity conduction voltage, complete right bundle branch block, and prolonged Q-TcF interval. Cardiac ultrasound indicated reduced left ventricular diastolic relaxation function but normal systolic function (EF 63%). The patient had a history of cerebral infarction for over 10 years, characterized by mild right-sided limb weakness and intermittent numbness in the upper extremities. He was diagnosed with coronary heart disease in May 2024 (without coronary CTA) and was on long-term management with aspirin and atorvastatin.

On November 28, 2024, the patient manifested shortness of breath, accompanied by cough, yellow sputum, fatigue, and bilateral knee pain.

On December 1, 2024, the patient was admitted to the hospital for worsening shortness of breath. Electrocardiogram showed abnormal Q waves in leads II, III, aVF, and V1-V6, along with ST-segment elevation. Lab results: hypersensitive troponin at 6456.6 pg/ml (reference range: 0–34.2 pg/ml), BNP at 650.8 pg/ml (reference range: 0–100 pg/ml), and myoglobin > 1,200 ng/ml (reference range: 0–146.9 ng/ml). Initial treatment included antiplatelet agents (aspirin, clopidogrel), cardioprotective medications (Coenzyme Q10, polarizing solution, nicotinamide), ventricular rate control drugs (metoprolol tartrate, esmolol), heart failure management drugs (recombinant human brain natriuretic peptide), and anti-infective agents (piperacillin-tazobactam, meropenem), without corticosteroids. ECG showed extensive ST-T changes in leads II, III, aVF, and V1-V6, with abnormal Q waves and ST segment elevation. Ectopic rhythm mean ventricular rate, wide QRS tachycardia.

Pathological examination revealed intestinal lesions, initially leading to a misdiagnosis as primary intestinal tumors with ALK rearrangement. Further investigation revealed the intestinal lesions to be intestinal metastasis originating from pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma, specifically intestinal metastasis of ALK-positive pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma, or intestinal metastasis of an ALK-rearranged pulmonary adenocarcinoma. The patient was diagnosed with Small intestine metastasis in ALK-rearrangement lung cancer. The initial misdiagnosis was due to the resemblance of the intestinal lesions to inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT), ALK-positive IMT, epithelioid inflammatory myofibroblastic sarcoma (EIMS), or other ALK-positive gastrointestinal neoplasms. The differential diagnosis also included inflammatory spindle cell lesions of the cavum abdominals, IMT and anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). The patient was treated with ALK-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) therapy. Despite treatment, the patient experienced metastasis or recurrence, reflecting the poor prognosis of ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer. The patient's condition ultimately resulted in small bowel obstruction caused by lung carcinoma and local or distant metastases.

graph_055,True,"A clinical case report details the presentation, diagnosis, and potential treatment strategies for a patient with Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (LUSC), a subtype of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). LUSC, also referred to as lung squamous cell carcinoma, is a type of lung cancer often associated with smokers and carries a poor prognosis.

The patient's LUSC was characterized by a TP53 mutation and the presence of a PLPP5‐FGFR1 fusion gene. FGFR fusions, including the PLPP5‐FGFR1 fusion, are known to play a role in tumor initiation and progression in some cancers. FGFR1 amplification and other FGFR fusion variants are also relevant in cancer.

The presence of the PLPP5‐FGFR1 fusion suggests a potential therapeutic target. FGFR inhibitors are a class of treatments that may be effective in tumors harboring fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) alterations. The treatment outcomes and prognosis impacts associated with FGFR fusions in LUSC are areas of active investigation. The TP53 mutation is also a factor that can influence prognosis. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of translocation partners and fusion genes in LUSC and to optimize treatment strategies for patients with these genetic alterations.

graph_060,True,"A patient with a history of early-stage lung cancer surgery seven years prior presented with a constellation of neurological symptoms including behavior abnormalities, altered consciousness, and seizures over the preceding five months. Initial investigations, including head CT and MRI, revealed multiple punctate calcifications in the brain. After ruling out infectious and autoimmune encephalitis through relevant testing and ineffective treatment trials, the patient's symptoms were suspected to be related to brain and meningeal metastasis from lung cancer. Further diagnostic workup, including a brain biopsy and genetic testing, confirmed the diagnosis of metastatic lung adenocarcinoma with an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) L858R mutation. The patient was subsequently treated with osimertinib, a targeted therapy, which resulted in significant improvement of their symptoms. The patient had no history of brain radiation and no evidence of extracranial recurrence or metastasis until the onset of neurological symptoms.

Biopsy results and further imaging revealed multiple bone and brain metastases, leading to a diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma (cT4N2M1c, stage IVB). Molecular profiling was performed to guide treatment decisions. No driver gene mutations or rearrangements were detected, but the programmed death–ligand 1 tumor proportion score was 60%. Based on the tumor proportion score, the patient was started on palliative radiation for spinal and brain metastases and first-line chemotherapy with cisplatin, pemetrexed, and pembrolizumab. After 13 cycles of chemotherapy, imaging revealed ascites and progressive disease. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed ascites, confirmed as adenocarcinoma by cytological analysis. Due to disease progression, docetaxel and ramucirumab (DTX + RAM) were introduced as second-line therapy. Despite second-line therapy, the patient's condition continued to decline. Ascites worsened, necessitating frequent abdominal paracentesis, and activities of daily living (ADL) declined. Performance status (PS) was 1, and her abdomen was markedly distended (91 cm).

graph_067,True,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) frequently presents with overt metastatic spread, portending a negative prognosis. Conventional treatments include chemotherapeutic agents and molecularly targeted and/or immunotherapeutic agents. Most responders to systemic chemotherapy in metastatic disease experience progression shortly after treatment discontinuation and it is very unusual for a patient to continue to manifest ongoing regression of malignant lesions unless treatment is continued. Moreover, responses occur early during therapy, typically within two to four months, and rarely continue beyond that time frame.

In this study, we describe a 67-year-old man with stage IV spindle cell cancer (initially diagnosed as NSCLC) who demonstrated ongoing radiographic regression over 20 months after receiving only a single dose of an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) without any additional systemic therapy. Conventional approaches would have continued the ICI and credited any ongoing response to multiple doses. However, this case emphasizes that short exposure to ICI may be sufficient in select circumstances. Given that the five-year survival rate for stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has historically been below 5%, observing such a durable response highlights the potential for more individualized immunotherapy strategies.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) frequently presents with overt metastatic spread, which generally confers a dismal prognosis. In metastatic disease, most responders to chemotherapy relapse soon after therapy ends. Responses are also traditionally expected to appear early in treatment - within the first few months - and seldom continue to deepen if therapy is discontinued.

In the era of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), clinicians commonly maintain treatment for prolonged periods, assuming that ongoing exposure is needed for sustained immune-mediated tumor control. This case challenges that assumption. A 67-year-old man with stage IV spindle cell lung cancer experienced a 20-month progression-free interval after just a single dose of ICI, with no other anticancer treatment. Histopathological analysis ultimately confirmed a metastatic spindle cell component, diverging from a typical primary adenocarcinoma of the lung.

Conventional approaches would have persisted with ICI dosing, thereby crediting long-term remission to continued therapy. In contrast, this single-dose scenario underscores the possibility that short ICI exposure can prompt a robust and durable immune response. These observations may inform future strategies that reduce treatment burden, toxicity, and costs, given that they are validated by broader studies.

A 67-year-old male originally presented in 2016 with stage IIIA NSCLC (adenocarcinoma) treated by right middle lobectomy, followed by adjuvant carboplatin/paclitaxel and postoperative radiotherapy (PORT). In 2022, he developed metastatic disease in the right lung, liver, and brain. An upper and lower GI endoscopy was performed due to microcytosis, which suggested a possible gastrointestinal primary, but no lesions were identified.

After stereotactic radiation to the single brain metastasis, the patient received infusional 5-fluorouracil/oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) empirically. Histopathological analysis of liver lesions identified a spindle cell carcinoma likely pulmonary in origin despite atypical features. Because of a high proliferative Ki-67 index (90%), the patient received nine weekly doses of docetaxel. However, the disease displayed only modest shrinkage (approximately 10-15%).

In August 2022, a single dose of pembrolizumab (200 mg IV) was administered. Radiographic imaging soon demonstrated more pronounced regression in both lung and liver lesions than had been achieved by chemotherapy alone. The response deepened over the subsequent months without any further anticancer therapy. As of his most recent CT scan in November 2024 - over 20 months after the single ICI dose - he continues to exhibit stable disease, with no new metastatic lesions. He has not reported any immune-related adverse events.

Further investigation with chest CT revealed a 3.1 cm right lower lobe tumor, lymphadenopathy, right pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, and scattered nodules in bilateral breasts. Her CA19-9 level was 282 U/mL. Approximately 20 scattered tumor shadows, measuring up to 1.2 cm, were observed in both breasts. Molecular analysis of a transbronchial lung biopsy of the lung adenocarcinoma specimen using the Oncomine Dx Target Test (ODxTT) Multi-CDx System detected an EML4-ALK fusion gene. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining of the specimen revealed positivity for AE1/AE3, CAM5.2, E-cadherin, and thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) according to the IHC analysis. A needle biopsy of bilateral breast tumors was performed, and the histological findings on HE staining corresponded to adenocarcinoma derived from the lungs or breasts. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) of lung and bilateral breast specimens showed positivity for TTF-1 and E-cadherin, and negativity for ER, PgR, and HER2. ALK immunostaining was positive. FISH analysis detected ALK rearrangement with isolated red and green signals along with fused red/green signals. ALK copy number gain was noted in both specimens. Based on these findings, the bilateral breast tumors were diagnosed as metastases from lung adenocarcinoma. Oral treatment with alectinib (600 mg once a day) was initiated. With alectinib treatment, tumor sizes reduced to 1.2 cm, and the breast metastases nearly disappeared, shrinking to a maximum size of 4 mm. Chest CT findings at six months after alectinib treatment showed tumor size reduction in the lower right lobe and resolution of the pleural effusion. Follow-up CT imaging showed resolution of shadows in bilateral breasts. Lymphadenopathy, pleural effusions, and pericardial effusions decreased. The CA 19-9 level decreased to 3.7 U/mL. Alectinib therapy is ongoing, with no evidence of recurrence. The patient was diagnosed with ALK rearrangement-positive pulmonary adenocarcinoma with bilateral scattered breast metastases."
graph_084,True,"A patient presented with a constellation of symptoms including cough, chest pain, and intermittent fever. Physical examination revealed coarse breathing sounds, rales, and pleural friction sounds. Notably, cardiac dullness was detected on the right side of the chest, indicating a right-sided heart, suggestive of visceral inversion.

The patient's history revealed a prior diagnosis of Kartagener syndrome, characterized by visceral inversion, sinusitis, and bronchiectasis. Imaging studies revealed signs of chronic inflammation and bronchiectasis, as well as nodules, pleural thickening, and calcification. Further investigation of the sinuses revealed right maxillary sinusitis and ethmoid sinus involvement, along with a nasal soft tissue shadow, deviated nasal septum, and turbinate hypertrophy, suggestive of polyps.

Given the respiratory symptoms, a lung infection was suspected. Bronchial phlegm embolism and a foreign body obstruction were considered. A bronchoscopy was performed to visualize the bronchial tubes. This revealed a polypoid neoplasm with necrosis. The lesion was biopsied.

Histopathological examination of the biopsied tissue revealed cancer cells. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was collected and examined using H&E stain. This revealed heterogeneous epithelioid cells, dense cells, and deeply stained nuclei with little cytoplasm, further supporting the diagnosis of Small-cell lung cancer.

Initial presentation of right locus coeruleus, visceral inversion, sinusitis and bronchial dilatation led to further cardiac evaluation. Electrocardiography showed a right-sided heart. Electrocardiography showing a right-sided heart prompted further imaging with chest CT and 3D reconstruction of the ribs to evaluate lung and organ positioning. Chest CT + 3D reconstruction of the ribs revealed chronic inflammation of both lungs, multiple bronchiectasis in both lungs, nodules in the upper lobe of the right lung, a flaky high-density shadow in the right main bronchus, bilateral pleural thickening, localized calcification of the right pleura and a right-sided heart with transposition of thoracic and abdominal organs. Chest CT findings of chronic lung inflammation, bronchiectasis, nodules, pleural thickening, and organ transposition prompted further investigation of the paranasal sinuses. Paranasal sinus CT revealed right maxillary sinusitis, ethmoid sinus, nasal soft tissue shadow, polyps, deviated nasal septum, and bilateral middle and lower turbinate hypertrophy. Paranasal sinus CT findings of sinusitis, polyps, and turbinate hypertrophy led to bronchoscopy to evaluate the bronchial tubes. Bronchoscopy revealed normal bronchial tubes in the right lung. Normal bronchial tubes in the right lung led to further bronchoscopic evaluation of the left lung. Bronchoscopy revealed a polypoid neoplasm in the opening of the upper lobe of the left lung, incompletely obstructing the lumen and spreading along the middle segment to the opening of the middle and lower lobes of the left lung, with necrosis on the surface. Bronchoscopy revealing a polypoid neoplasm in the left lung prompted bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cytology. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cytology revealed cancer cells. H&E stain revealed heterogeneous epithelioid cells with dense cells, deeply stained nuclei and little cytoplasm. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cytology showing cancer cells led to immunohistochemistry to determine the type of cancer. Immunohistochemistry: CK7(+), CD56(+), TTF-1(+), Syn(+), CgA(-), NapsinA(-) and LCK(+). Diagnosis of small cell lung cancer confirmed. Diagnosis of small cell lung cancer prompted auxiliary examination for metastasis. Extrapulmonary auxiliary examination suggested bone metastasis.

graph_095,True,"Initially, the patient was diagnosed as early stage LCLC and underwent a radical resection of the right lower lobe. Just one month later, multiple fulminant body and mouth lesions appeared in the right upper arm, right elbow, right waist, and tongue root. Meanwhile, serum neuron specific enolase (NSE) concentration dramatically increased from 12.12 to 30.14 ng/ml. Immumohistochemistry findings demonstrated moderate PD-L1 expressions with tumor proportion score (TPS), while next-generation sequencing indicated moderate tumor mutational burden (TMB) levels and gene mutations in *PBRM1* L1230P and *TP53* L194R of both foci. Besides, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I (HLA-A*02:03, HLA-B*55:02 and HLA-C*12:03) were detected in the right upper arm metastasis, which may facilitate malignant postoperative metastases in this case. Notably, this patient received combination therapy with anti-PD-1 antibody sintilimab plus anlotinib, and achieved a partial response for at least 12 months. Using an integrated computational method, the mutant peptide TEIPENDIPL derived from PBRM1 L1230P was predicted to be a specific neoantigen and could still be presented by HLA-B*40:01. This case suggests that immunotherapy plus antiangiogenic drug may provide an alternative therapeutic option for advanced LCLC patients without common gene mutations.

A 74-year-old Japanese man developed interstitial pneumonia and was followed up at our hospital. Chest computed tomography (CT) performed six months before admission showed dense infiltrations mainly below the ventral subpleural area in the right upper lobe and right middle lobe. As these shadows did not improve with oral antibiotic therapy, he was admitted to our hospital for a further examination and treatment. The shadows were enlarged on admission; thus, we suspected exacerbation of chronic lung inflammation or organizing pneumonia. On auscultation, a pleural friction rub was heard in the right chest.

Therefore, bronchoscopy was performed to target pulmonary infiltrations for further investigation. No microorganisms or malignant cells were identified in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. A pathological analysis of the transbronchial lung biopsy specimen did not reveal any malignancy or specific inflammation. Chest MRI showed no abnormalities in the spine or spinal cord but did show some nodules around the right pleura and right pleural effusion.

Subsequent thoracoscopy revealed multiple white nodules in the right parietal pleura, some of which were in the right thoracic area as one of the first clinical manifestations of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. We should consider the possibility of pleural diseases, including metastatic lung cancer, when encountering patients presenting with unilateral thoracic hyperhidrosis.

Full body CT and positron emission tomography showed stage IIIB adenocarcinoma with metastatic involvement of numerous hilar, mediastinal, and supraclavicular lymph nodes, as well as a subpleural nodule in the right lower lobe. The patient had plans to initiate chemotherapy, but suffered a stroke several weeks after initial presentation. The patient elected to go to hospice and passed away prior to receiving chemotherapy."
graph_108,True,"Examining the differential of digital ischaemia and review of paraneoplastic ischaemia.

There is a broad differential diagnosis of digital ischaemia that includes commonly encountered conditions of vascular or thromboembolic nature as well as less commonly seen such as those of vasculitic or rheumatological origin. A less frequently encountered pathology is digital ischaemia associated with malignancy. This paraneoplastic process is rare and infrequently described in the literature, though it has been observed in various solid and haematological malignancies. Here, we describe a patient case with an atypical presentation of digital ischaemia and present a brief review on prior reports of digital ischaemia related to cancer.

Background: The differential diagnoses of digital ischaemia include atherosclerotic vascular disease, thromboembolic disease, toxic metabolite-induced ischaemia, rheumatological disease, vasculitis and less commonly recognised disease processes such as paraneoplastic syndromes. Digital ischaemia associated with cancer (DIAC) is thought to be a rare paraneoplastic pathology that has previously been reported to coincide with, follow or precede a diagnosis of malignancy in a patient. Little is known of the pathophysiology with literature limited to a small number of case reports, case series or cohort studies with proposed mechanisms including vasospasm caused by overproduction of vasoconstrictive factors, intraluminal thrombosis, vasculitis, immune complex deposition or drug toxicity associated with treatment of the malignancy. Initially described in gastrointestinal and gynaecological malignancies, cases in both haematological malignancy and other solid tumours have since been reported with adenocarcinoma as the most frequently found underlying histopathology. We present a case of a patient with an atypical presentation of digital ischaemia, examine the differential and review a less commonly considered diagnosis of DIAC.

graph_109,True,"# Malignant Peritoneal Mesothelioma Presenting as a Mass in a Spigelian Hernia: Report of a Case

Cancers that occur within the abdomen and pelvis may present within a hernia. This case report describes a patient who presented with a large (11 cm greatest diameter) mass in the left lower quadrant. The mass was located within a Spigelian hernia belt and was composed of malignant peritoneal mesothelioma. At the time of cytoreductive surgery, numerous other sites of malignant peritoneal mesothelioma were present within the abdomen and pelvis.

The patient's left lower quadrant mass was a malignant peritoneal mesothelioma presenting within a Spigelian hernia defect. This phenomenon has not been previously reported. Cancer presenting within a Spigelian hernia has also not been previously reported.

Gastrointestinal cancer, gynecologic cancer, and malignant peritoneal mesothelioma may disseminate widely to the surfaces of the abdomen and pelvis. In some patients, this spread of the disease may find its way into a hernia sac. When cancer disseminates within the abdominal and pelvic space as peritoneal metastases, it does so by a definite pattern that is characteristic of a particular cancer diagnosis. Hernia defects of the parietal peritoneal lining of the abdomen and pelvis are sites for cancer cells to be trapped and then progress. Peritoneal mesothelioma progressed rapidly within a hernia sac.

graph_109,False,"A 70-year-old white woman presented in November 2002 with pain in a left lower quadrant abdominal mass. Physical examination revealed a mass fixed within the abdominal wall musculature within the left lower quadrant of the abdomen.

On March 4, 2003, the patient underwent a 9-hour surgical procedure to remove mesothelioma from the abdominal wall, abdomen, and pelvis. Resection of the mass from the left lower aspect of the abdominal wall required resection of the lower one-half of the rectus abdominus muscle and adjacent abdominal wall musculature to the iliac crest.

On November 11, 2003, a CT scan showed an 11 cm mass within the anterior abdominal wall and a 5 cm by 2.9 cm mass associated with the right colon. No disease was seen outside the abdomen and pelvis. Biopsy of the abdominal wall mass showed malignant peritoneal mesothelioma.

The resected specimen measured 15 cm × 12 cm × 7 cm. Greater omentectomy and splenectomy, peritoneum from beneath the right hemidiaphragm, tumor nodules from small bowel and its mesentery, and complete pelvic peritonectomy with resection of rectosigmoid colon, uterus, Fallopian tubes and ovaries were performed.

The patient was treated with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) after complete cytoreduction.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful.

Eighteen months postoperatively, a CT scan showed multiple lung metastases.

The patient died of progressive malignant mesothelioma in July 2005, 29 months after cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC. The malignant mesothelioma tumor was located in the left lower quadrant of the abdominal wall at the anatomic site of a Spigelian hernia.

Malignant peritoneal mesothelioma was widely distributed on the peritoneal surfaces of the abdomen and pelvis. The largest tumor accumulation was within the Spigelian hernia sac. Tumor was present within the omentum in large volume. Malignant mesothelioma was layered out on the peritoneal surface of the right hemidiaphragm, surface of the spleen and pelvic peritoneal surfaces."
graph_110,False,"A 64-year-old male presented in April 2022 with blood-tinged sputum of unknown etiology, estimated volume approximately 5 ml. In May 2022, the patient experienced a recurring episode of hemoptysis with similar characteristics and volume, prompting a chest CT scan at Xingyi People's Hospital (Xingyi, China). The imaging examination identified a lesion in the posterior segment of the right lower lobe, accompanied by slight bronchial dilation and distal infection, measuring approximately 2.8 x 3.2 cm.

The patient was administered antitussive (10 mg codeine, taken orally twice daily), hemostatic (10 units posterior pituitary hormone dissolved in 250 ml 10% glucose solution for intravenous infusion) and anti-infective therapies (1.5 g cefuroxime sodium in 100 ml 0.9% sodium chloride solution administered via intravenous infusion, once every 8 h), but the patient's clinical status did not demonstrate any notable improvement.

Five days prior to admission to the Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, axial and coronal CT scans of the chest showed a mass in the right lower lung. One day post-admission, axial and coronal CT scans of the chest showed a right lower lung patch with cavitation. Lung cancer was suspected, and infectious lesions complicated with abscess formation could not be ruled out.

Six days after the recurrence of hemoptysis, the patient was transferred to the Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University for further evaluation. The patient had a smoking history of over 40 years, consuming approximately 15 cigarettes daily, and had abstained from smoking for 1 week. Physical examination revealed diminished breath sounds on the right side. Blood cell evaluations showed elevated inflammatory markers, including white blood cells, absolute neutrophils, and neutrophil percentage.

Post-admission, coagulation parameters, pulmonary function tests, whole-body bone scintigraphy, and cranial CT findings all exhibited normal results. A chest CT scan exhibited patchy opacities in the right lower lobe with the presence of a cavity, measuring approximately 5.7 x 4.5 cm. The lesion was suspected to be indicative of lung cancer.

Two days post-admission, the patient developed a high fever, with a maximum temperature reaching 39.2°C.

Post-admission, empirical antibiotic therapy with cefuroxime sodium was initiated (1.5 g cefuroxime sodium in 100 ml 0.9% sodium chloride solution administered via intravenous infusion, once every 8 h).

On day 3 post-admission, the antibiotic treatment was switched to piperacillin (4.5 g piperacillin sodium in 100 ml 0.9% sodium chloride solution administered via intravenous infusion, once every 8 h) due to persistent fever."
graph_110,True,"A patient presented with symptoms including cough, high fever, and blood-tinged sputum (hemoptysis). Initial investigations revealed a lung abscess (LA). Further evaluation was necessary to differentiate between benign and malignant LAs, as pulmonary tumors, including lung cancer (specifically squamous cell carcinoma), can manifest as lung abscesses. The patient's condition was complicated by the possibility of cancer recurrence.

The differential diagnosis included pulmonary infections such as pulmonary cryptococcosis and pulmonary actinomycosis, as well as aspergillomas. Imaging revealed parenchymal consolidation and diffuse interstitial infiltration, raising concerns for infection and potential distal infection due to bronchial dilation and bronchial obstruction leading to atelectasis. Fat liquefaction and necrotic lesions were also observed within the abscess.

The patient's case was further complicated by the potential for postoperative infections, especially given the possibility of surgical intervention. Immunosuppressive signaling could also contribute to the development or persistence of the infection. Bacterial infections were a significant concern.

Unfortunately, the patient experienced treatment delays and diagnostic errors, potentially due to oversight. Therapeutic inefficacy was noted, and the case ultimately resulted in postoperative mortality. The presence of pathogens contributed to the severity of the condition. The possibility of secondary acute LA was also considered.

graph_111,False,"A 34-year-old male presented with a tumor in the upper lobe of the right lung and an enlarged right upper paratracheal lymph node detected via CT and PET. He was diagnosed with stage IIIB adenocarcinoma (ADC) of the lung (cT3N2M0) after pathological assessment of a CT-guided biopsy. Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of 14 genes detected an EML4-ALK rearrangement (EML4: exon6-ALK:exon20) with an allele frequency of 26.2%.

The patient received one cycle of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with pemetrexed (800 mg) and carboplatin (AUC=5), but the tumor did not shrink.

Due to the lack of response to chemotherapy, the patient received 8 weeks of neoadjuvant targeted therapy with ceritinib (450 mg/day).

Chest CT after 4 weeks of ceritinib treatment revealed a partial response (PR) with a 38% tumor shrinkage.

After another 4 weeks of neoadjuvant ceritinib treatment, the lung tumor further shrank by 55%, with a decrease in SUVmax from 28.04 to 9.51. Enlarged lymph nodes subsided. Mild diarrhea was reported as an adverse effect of ceritinib treatment.

After one cycle of chemotherapy, the tumor and the lymph node remained stable. After eight weeks of ceritinib treatment, the maximum diameters of primary lung (PL) tumor and right upper paratracheal lymph node (LN2R) were 25.2 and 6.4 mm, respectively, with an SUVmax of 9.51 and 2.88. Hematoxylin\u2013eosin (HE) staining of samples punctured before neoadjuvant ceritinib showed nests of tumor cells with necrosis. IHC examinations revealed positive ALK (D5F3), CK7, P63, P40, and negative TTF\u20101, supporting a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma (ADC).

Following neoadjuvant ceritinib treatment, the patient underwent surgical resection. Post-operative pathology revealed a significant decrease in tumor cells, interstitial fibrosis, and scattered lymphocytes in the tumor bed. Round tumor cell nests with eosinophilic cytoplasm and vesicular nuclei were seen. IHC: ALK (D5F3)+, CK7+, TTF-1+, P63+, P40+; histology was consistent with adenocarcinoma (ASC). The right upper paratracheal lymph node also showed scattered nests of tumor cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and vesicular nuclei. IHC: ALK (D5F3)+, CK7+, TTF-1+, P63+, P40+; histology was consistent with adenocarcinoma (ASC).

Baseline biopsy revealed adenocarcinoma (ACC). Comparison of the tissue NGS sequencing results before and after ceritinib administration revealed a decrease in the allele frequency of EML4\u2010ALK, from 26.2 to 2.3%."
graph_111,True,"A patient presented with locally advanced adenosquamous carcinoma (ASC). A pretreatment biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of ASC, which included components of both adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) revealed an EML4-ALK fusion. The tumor was ALK-positive.

Initially, the patient received neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by neoadjuvant ceritinib treatment. The patient achieved a partial response (PR) to ceritinib.

Subsequently, the patient underwent complete surgical resection (R0) via video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). The surgery was complicated by mild adhesions and bleeding.

Post-surgical pathology confirmed the initial diagnosis. The patient tolerated ceritinib, although diarrhea was noted as a side effect. The patient achieved surgical R0 resection.

graph_112,True,"A 73-year-old male with lung cancer underwent bone scintigraphy for disease staging. Planar whole-body bone scintigraphy was performed in the anterior and posterior projections 3 hours after the injection of 740 MBq (20 mCi) of 99m technetium hydroxymethylene diphosphonate (<sup>99m</sup>Tc-HMDP). The bone scintigraphy images incidentally demonstrated diffuse myocardial tracer uptake. A diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis was suspected, although the patient had no symptoms at this time. Cardiac uptake on the planar image at 3 hours was evaluated using a semiquantitative visual scoring method in relation to bone (rib) uptake: grade 0 =no cardiac uptake and normal bone uptake; grade 1=cardiac uptake less than rib uptake; grade 2=cardiac uptake equal to rib uptake; and grade 3=cardiac uptake greater than rib uptake with mild/absent rib uptake. The cardiac uptake of this patient corresponded to grade 3 (uptake greater than rib uptake with mild rib uptake). Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) showed particularly strong uptake in the ventricular septum. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) showed widespread subendocardial and partly transmural enhancement of the left ventricular myocardium on delayed postcontrast T1-weighted images.

A PET-CT scan revealed fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in a 6-cm tumor shadow in the upper lobe of the left lung, metastatic tumors in the left lung and right adrenal gland, and a retroperitoneal tumor. Increased diffuse bone marrow FDG uptake was also observed.

The patient underwent wedge resection of the left upper lung with the tumor shadow and was diagnosed with T4N0M1c stage IVB primary NSCLC-NOS. Immunohistochemistry was negative for thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1), napsin A, p40, chromogranin A, synaptophysin, and CD56 staining. Lung tumors showed a tumor proportion score (TPS) of 50–60% for programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) (22C3) and no expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements. Blood testing on admission showed leucocytosis (48,800/μL) and neutrophilia (43,600/μL) with abnormally high expression of serum G-CSF (502.2 pg/mL, normal range: <39.0 pg/mL). The patient was diagnosed with advanced G-CSF-producing NSCLC-NOS that was compatible with diffuse uptake of FDG into the bone marrow owing to G-CSF-producing carcinoma.

Treatment with the anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) antibody pembrolizumab (200 mg/body) was started and repeated every three weeks. After seven courses of pembrolizumab, the patient developed grade 3 type 1 diabetes, and pembrolizumab treatment was discontinued."

His initial vital signs were: blood pressure, 117/53 mmHg; pulse rate, 59 beats/min; body temperature, 35.8°C; percutaneous oxygen saturation, 98%.

Physical examination revealed non-palpable neck and supraclavicular lymph nodes. Tumor markers (carcinoembryonic antigen, cytokeratin 19 fragment, pro-gastrin-releasing peptide, prostate-specific antigen) were within normal limits. Chest radiography revealed an ill-defined patchy shadow, 20 mm in size, in the right middle lung field. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a 20 mm subpleural ground-glass opacity with pleural indentation and spiculation in the superior segment of the right lower lobe (S6) area.

Further imaging with FDG-PET/CT showed FDG uptake (SUVmax=2.0) in the nodular shadow in the right S6. Abnormal FDG accumulation (SUVmax=approximately 6.0) was also noted in the bilateral ribs, lumbar vertebrae, bilateral femurs, and left ilium. No FDG accumulation was observed in regional lymph nodes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed no intracranial metastases but showed enhancements in the parietal bone, left temporal bone, and cervical spine, suggestive of bone marrow reversion.

A CT-guided percutaneous biopsy of the lung nodule was performed, revealing fibrosis of the alveolar tissue and moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with an acinar pattern within the fibrosis.

Based on these findings, the patient was initially diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma [positive for an epidermal growth factor receptor mutation (L858R)] and staged as clinical stage IVB (cT1bN0M1c) with multiple bone metastases. MRI of the pelvic cavity showed lesions diffusely spread over the lumbar spine, pelvis, and femur with a high signal intensity on T2-weighted, short TI inversion recovery, and diffusion-weighted imaging and a low signal intensity on T1-weighted phase contrast imaging, suggesting the possibility of re-conversion to the red marrow.

Given the abnormal FDG uptake in the red bone marrow, a CT-guided biopsy of the left iliac bone was performed. The biopsy revealed infiltration with small atypical lymphocyte-like cells (CD5-positive, CD20-positive, CD43-positive, CD3-negative, CD10-negative, CD33-negative, and cyclin D1-negative) along the bone trabeculae without lung cancer metastases, leading to a diagnosis of a low-grade B-cell lymphoma. Bone marrow examination confirmed B-cell clusters in some areas, CD20 positivity, and CD5 positivity, consistent with low-grade B-cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL).

Following the diagnosis of the second primary malignancy, the lung cancer was restaged to cT1bN0M0, stage IA2. MRI of the pelvic cavity showed diffuse high-signal lesions in the lumbar spine, pelvis, and femur on T1-weighted in-phase images and diffusion-weighted images; these lesions had a low signal on T1-weighted out-of-phase images. FDG-PET/CT showed uptake of FDG in the left ilium. A CT-guided percutaneous needle biopsy of the left iliac bone was performed.

On March 13, 2019, the patient underwent a total hysterectomy with double appendages. Pathological examination revealed a 3.5 x 2.5 cm highly differentiated endometrial adenocarcinoma that invaded the superficial myometrium (<1/2 of the myometrium). No metastasis was found in bilateral pelvic lymph nodes, and the endometrial cancer was staged as pIA. No adjuvant therapy was administered, and the patient was advised to seek treatment for the mediastinal tumor.

Six months post-radical operation, the patient was admitted to the Department of Thoracic Surgery, asymptomatic. A thoracoabdominal CT scan showed a solitary 5.2 x 8.0 x 7.1 cm tumor in the right mediastinum near the pericardium. A bone scan showed no bone metastasis.

On September 7, 2019, the patient underwent video-assisted thoracoscopy. The tumor was found in the right cardiophrenic angle, approximately 8 cm in maximum diameter, with a hard texture and clear boundary, adhering to the pericardium and lower lobe of the right lung. It was determined that the tumor had grown in the diaphragm rather than in the mediastinum.

A thoracotomy was performed through the right fifth intercostal space. The diaphragm was resected along with a 1 cm margin of the tumor. The tumor had grown into the abdominal cavity and was stripped from the liver’s surface. The tumor was removed with the invaded diaphragm. The diaphragmatic defect was repaired by a Dacron patch.

graph_120,True,"After adenocarcinoma, squamous cell lung cancer is the most common type of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) among non-smokers. Diagnosis and staging of lung diseases, including adenocarcinoma, squamous cell lung cancer, and NSCLC, are best achieved through a tissue biopsy followed by imaging, including chest X-ray, computed tomography (CT) of the lung, and positron emission tomography (PET) scan.

Sometimes, the histopathological appearance of squamous cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) can be confused with organizing pneumonia. Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP), formerly known as bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), occurs secondary to injury to the alveolar wall and typically presents in the fifth or sixth decade of life, affecting both males and females in equal proportions. COP may mimic several different disease pathologies, including community-acquired pneumonia, idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIPs), and lung carcinoma.

Any lung mass that is highly suspicious for carcinoma should be closely monitored with imaging, and a repeat tissue biopsy should be done for a confirmation of the diagnosis to start appropriate therapy as soon as possible.

graph_124,False,"A 69-year-old male with a 10-year history of arterial hypertension presented with chest tightness and shortness of breath for 2 months and a dry cough for half a month. Chest CT revealed an infection in the upper lobe of the left lung and a lesion in the left hilar region. Antibiotic treatment was administered, but repeat chest CT scan revealed no significant changes in the mediastinum or left hilar mass. Chest contrast-enhanced CT revealed a lesion in the left hilar region measuring approximately 43 \u00d7 63 mm and encroaching on the left pulmonary artery, suggesting malignancy. CT-guided percutaneous core needle biopsy of the left hilar lesion was performed. CT scan revealed hypodense lesions in a small portion of the ill-defined part of the left hilar mass. Morphological analysis of the left hilar biopsy tissue revealed nests, beams, and chrysanthemum-shaped clusters of arranged cells. The tumor cells were small, with little cytoplasm, indistinct cell boundaries, fine chromatin, and a lack of nucleoli. IHC staining of the left hilar lesion biopsy revealed that the tumor cells were positive for CK, TTF-1, CD56, and Syn, and the Ki-67 index was approximately 90%.

graph_132,True,"An 80-year-old man with non-small cell lung cancer developed IgG4-related retroperitoneal fibrosis after receiving treatment with nivolumab and ipilimumab (NI therapy). Eight months after NI therapy was initiated, the patient developed lower abdominal pain. Although the primary lung lesion maintained its reduced size on computed tomography, there was an increase in the soft tissue shadows intensity around the abdominal aorta, bladder, and seminal vesicles, suggesting retroperitoneal fibrosis. Blood tests showed elevated IgG4 levels. Computed tomography-guided biopsy of the retroperitoneum showed B cell-dominant lymphocyte infiltration consistent with IgG4-related retroperitoneal fibrosis and characteristic CD8-positive lymphocyte infiltration, suggestive of the involvement of cytotoxic T cells. Based on the clinical, imaging, and pathological findings, the patient was diagnosed with IgG4-related retroperitoneal fibrosis due to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). Immunotherapy discontinuation alone did not result in improvement; therefore, steroid therapy was initiated. Systemic steroid therapy was initiated, and imaging showed reduction in size of the retroperitoneal fibrosis. This case highlights that IgG4-related retroperitoneal fibrosis can occur as an immune-related adverse event when administering anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies for cancer immunotherapy. Early steroid therapy could be effective in controlling this immune-related adverse event.

Molecular biology testing did not detect driver gene mutation/translocation, and the PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) was <1%. The tumor stage was cT4N3M1a (stage IV A).

On February 1, 2022, immunotherapy with nivolumab (360 mg/bodyweight) and ipilimumab (1 mg/kg) was initiated for advanced cell lung cancer with PD-L1 level <1%.

Eight months after the initiation of nivolumab and ipilimumab, a chest CT showed a reduction in the size of the primary lung lesion around the left pulmonary artery. However, a pelvic CT revealed soft tissue shadows around the abdominal aorta, bladder, and seminal vesicles that had increased in size. A PET-CT scan showed accumulation around the abdominal aorta and bladder.

One month after the initiation of steroid treatment, a CT scan showed a reduction in the soft tissue shadow around the abdominal aorta.

In late October 2022, the patient developed lower abdominal pain. A CT scan revealed an increased change in the soft tissue shadow around the abdominal aorta, bladder, and seminal vesicles, suggesting retroperitoneal fibrosis.

A PET-CT revealed fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) accumulation in the retroperitoneal area. Blood tests revealed a decrease in the CEA levels (CEA, 173.5 to 3.5 ng/mL), but an increase in the IgG4 levels (IgG4, 132 to 250 mg/dL; normal range, 80–140 mg/dL). Antinuclear antibodies were positive at a low titer of 1/40, whereas ACE and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were negative.

Four months prior to the nivolumab infusion, she was found to have progressive disease in the left hilum, and she underwent palliative radiation therapy in May and June 2017. In late August 2017, she was found to have further progressive disease on imaging with metastasis to the liver, bones, and right upper lobe. Biopsy of the liver confirmed small-cell carcinoma. She subsequently underwent 4 cycles of carboplatin and etoposide starting in September 2017. Her treatment was complicated by severe fatigue and hospital admission for febrile neutropenia requiring significant dose reductions. Despite these complications, she had a very good response on imaging after the second cycle of therapy in October 2017. She completed treatment in December 2017 and was placed on observation to allow for recovery time following treatment.

graph_137,True,"In patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-sensitive mutations, acquired resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) remains the main cause of treatment failure. Although osimertinib, a third-generation EGFR-TKI, is effective for patients whose tumors acquire T790M mutations, cytotoxic chemotherapy is often chosen for several reasons.

Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LM) is a severe condition associated with lung cancer, and which occurs in 9.4% of patients with EGFR-mutated lung cancer. The median survival time (MST) of patients with LM is reported to be 8.9 months, with conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy only having limited efficacy. Recent reports have suggested that erlotinib (E) and bevacizumab (B) combination treatment (E + B treatment) could be a useful option for treating patients harboring EGFR-sensitive mutations who develop LM after first-generation EGFR-TKI therapy. However, there are currently no published reports on the usefulness of E + B therapy in patients who developed LM after treatment with a second-generation EGFR-TKI, afatinib. We herein report a case in which E + B was effective for treating LM after the development of acquired resistance to afatinib.

CT scan findings prompted a right lung biopsy. Right lung biopsy showed invasive lung adenocarcinoma. EGFR mutation and ALK tests showed negative results. Biopsy results and PD-L1 testing led to a diagnosis and staging. PD-L1 expression was negative after immunohistochemical (IHC) assay. The patient was diagnosed with right lung adenocarcinoma (T4N2M1a, stage III), with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 1. Baseline chest CT showing a lung mass in the right lower lobe. Diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma led to the initiation of first-line chemotherapy with pemetrexed (850mg) plus nidaplatin (140\u2009mg). The patient received 6 cycles of platinum-based doublets and 1 cycle of pemetrexed disodium maintenance therapy and experienced disease progression (PD), with a progression-free survival (PFS) of 5 months. Disease progression after first-line therapy prompted a switch to second-line therapy with nivolumab (200\u2009mg, PFS, 2 months). Chest CT before second-line nivolumab. Nivolumab was given as a second-line therapy, but the patient progressed after 2 months. Third-line therapy was then started with nanoparticle albumin bound paclitaxel (450mg) plus anlotinib (12mg daily, PFS, 11.5 months). Patient had a partial response at 4 months after third-line therapy. Chest CT at disease progression. In April 2021, the patient began to have headaches and dizziness. New symptoms of headaches and dizziness prompted further imaging. Baseline chest CT and brain MRI before crizotinib. Headaches and dizziness led to brain MRI, revealing multiple brain metastases. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed multiple brain metastases. Partial response of all lung lesions and brain lesions after 2 months of crizotinib, but new liver lesions. Partial response of lung and brain lesions, but new liver lesions, led to consideration of entrectinib. Chest CT and brain MRI before entrectinib showing partial response and brain lesions progression."

graph_143,False,"A 68-year-old female patient with a BMI of 26 and a height of 165 cm (weight 70.3 kg) presented with pulmonary masses abutting the pleura or enlarged head/neck lymph nodes. The patient underwent transthoracic biopsies. Biopsies were performed under local anesthetic using a SonoSite® ultrasound with linear and curvilinear probes. An eight-centimeter 22 gauge fine needle aspiration (FNA) or an eight-centimeter 18 gauge Temno core biopsy were used for sample collection, with a mean of 5 passes on all the biopsy sites. The mean size of the transthoracic target was 5.6 cm in the smaller dimension.

The patient experienced pneumothoracies, which resolved with chest tube placement for three days in the hospital. The patient also experienced one episode of hemoptysis which resolved within several hours without intervention and observation alone, and one vasovagal episode which was fully resolved with post procedural monitoring.

Onsite pathology determined sample adequacy and transferred biopsies to the department of pathology. Post procedure, patients were evaluated by either three-point ultrasound to establish lung sliding or chest radiograph. Biopsy pathology resulted in a range of potential diagnoses, including Infection Likely, Hepatocellular carcinoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, Malignant melanoma, Adenocarcinoma, t-cell lymphoma, Non-diagnostic, Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), NSCLC: Adenocarcinoma, NSCLC: Squamous, and Small Cell Lung Cancer.

72% of procedures had a diagnosis via fine needle aspiration alone. 30% of procedures were ultrasound guided head/neck lymph node biopsies. Eight non-diagnostic percutaneous biopsies were performed. Future pathological samples revealed four were non-small cell lung cancer, one was a T cell lymphoma and two resolved with antibiotics and time. One sample remained undiagnosed."

Following the biopsies, pathology results revealed non-small cell lung cancer and T cell lymphoma. Transthoracic biopsies were performed. Complications arose, including pneumothoracies, requiring chest tube placement. Chest ultrasound was utilized to assess lung sliding. A chest radiograph was also performed.

During the procedures, local anesthetic was administered. Further fine needle aspiration and core biopsy were conducted. Post-biopsy, the patient experienced hemoptysis and a vasovagal episode. The biopsy sites were monitored. Transthoracic target biopsies were performed using CT guided techniques. Antibiotics were administered, likely to address a suspected infection.

graph_144,False,"A 47-year-old male with a past medical history significant for heavy smoking, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and previous intravenous drug use presented to the emergency department with persistent nonradiating pain in the right hypochondrium, nausea, anorexia, early satiety, and an 11-kg weight loss over 1 month. Physical examination revealed painful hepatomegaly. Laboratory values demonstrated microcytic normochromic anemia (Hb 7.2 g/dL), elevated alkaline phosphatase (254 U/L), and elevated gamma-glutamyl transferase (287 U/L).

To investigate the cause of these symptoms, the patient underwent abdominal ultrasound, thoraco-abdominopelvic CT, and upper endoscopy with biopsies. Abdominal ultrasound showed an enlarged and diffusely nodular liver. Thoraco-abdominopelvic CT demonstrated a 2-cm nodule in the inferior lobe of the left lung and signs of diffuse hepatic metastases. Upper endoscopy revealed a 1-cm ulcerated nodular lesion in the greater curvature of the gastric body. Biopsies demonstrated submucosal infiltration of small hyperchromatic cells with scant cytoplasm.

Immunohistochemistry of the gastric lesion and liver biopsy were performed to determine the type and origin of the cancer. Immunohistochemistry of the gastric lesion revealed diffuse immunoreactivity to CAM5.2, synaptophysin, and chromogranin, compatible with gastric infiltration of neoplastic cells with neuroendocrine differentiation. Liver biopsy showed similar histology. Bronchoalveolar lavage cytology and bronchial biopsy revealed TTF-1-positive cells with similar expression of neuroendocrine markers, confirming small cell lung cancer (SCLC).

Based on imaging and biopsy results, a diagnosis of stage IV small cell lung cancer (SCLC) was established. CT scan showed a 2-cm nodular lesion in the upper segment of the inferior lobe of the left lung and a 3.7 x 2.4 cm infracarinal adenomegaly. Hepatomegaly and diffuse hepatic metastases were present. A nodular lesion with central ulceration was noted in the greater curvature in the body of the stomach.

Palliative chemotherapy was initiated to treat the stage IV small cell lung cancer (SCLC).

The patient experienced nonspecific upper gastrointestinal symptoms with red flag signs, prompting an endoscopic evaluation. Gastric submucosal infiltration of hyperchromatic small neoplastic cells was observed (H&E, ×20). Liver biopsy demonstrated severe infiltration of liver parenchyma by neoplastic cells, with frequent figures of mitosis (arrow) and apoptosis. Liver biopsy demonstrated immunohistochemical expression of chromogranin neoplastic cells.

Neuroendocrine markers chromogranin and synaptophysin were strongly positive in the gastric lesion, suggesting gastric involvement by a neuroendocrine neoplasm, later confirmed as a SCLC metastasis. The patient's functional status rapidly deteriorated, and he died 3 months after the diagnosis."

graph_145,True,"Based on the provided data, reconstructing a complete clinical case report with patient demographics, a detailed timeline, specific treatments, and outcomes is impossible. The data only provides a list of diagnoses and symptoms. However, I can create a hypothetical case report incorporating all the mentioned elements, acknowledging the limitations of the source data.

**Hypothetical Case Report**

**Patient:**  We will refer to the patient as Mr. X.  (Demographics are unknown due to data limitations, so we will assume a male patient in his late 60s with a history of smoking).

**Presenting Symptoms:** Mr. X initially presented with dyspnea (shortness of breath), a productive cough, myalgia (muscle aches), and night sweats. He also exhibited fever and was hypoxemic (low blood oxygen levels).

**Timeline of Diagnoses and Events:**

*   **Initial Presentation:**  Mr. X presented with the aforementioned symptoms.

*   **Initial Investigations:**  Following the initial presentation, investigations were undertaken (details unknown).

*   **Diagnosis 1: Lung Adenocarcinoma:**  Mr. X was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma. Further specification indicates this was also identified as non-squamous cell lung cancer.

*   **Diagnosis 2: Pneumocystis Pneumonia (PCP):**  Concurrent with or shortly after the lung adenocarcinoma diagnosis, Mr. X was diagnosed with Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP).  The data also mentions ""pneumocystis"" which is likely a shorthand reference to the same infection.

*   **Treatment (Hypothetical):** Given the diagnoses of lung adenocarcinoma and PCP, treatment likely involved chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy for the lung cancer, along with antibiotics (e.g., trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) for the PCP.  Supportive care for hypoxemia would also be necessary.

*   **Subsequent Diagnoses:** Over time, Mr. X was diagnosed with several other conditions:

    *   Acute Pneumonitis
    *   Acute Interstitial Lung Disease
    *   Pneumonitis (multiple instances, potentially related to treatment or disease progression)
    *   Interstitial Pneumonitis
    *   Renal Cell Carcinoma
    *   Melanoma
    *   Metastatic Melanoma

*   **Adverse Event:** At some point, Mr. X experienced anaphylactic shock. The trigger is unknown from the data, but could be related to a medication.

*   **Treatment Adjustments (Hypothetical):** The emergence of renal cell carcinoma and melanoma/metastatic melanoma would necessitate further treatment adjustments, potentially including targeted therapies, immunotherapy, or surgical interventions, depending on the stage and characteristics of these cancers. Management of pneumonitis would also be crucial, potentially involving corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants.

**Outcomes (Hypothetical):**

Given the complexity and severity of the diagnoses, including multiple cancers and opportunistic infections, the prognosis for Mr. X would be guarded. The anaphylactic shock represents a life-threatening event that would require immediate intervention. The overall outcome would depend on the stage of the cancers at diagnosis, the response to treatment, and the patient's overall health and tolerance of the therapies.  Without further information, it is impossible to determine the final outcome (e.g., remission, disease progression, death).

**Limitations:**

This case report is highly speculative due to the limited data provided.  Crucial information such as patient demographics, specific dates of diagnoses, treatment details, laboratory results, imaging findings, and the patient's response to treatment are missing.  Therefore, this reconstruction should be considered a hypothetical scenario based on the available data.

Three days after the first pembrolizumab administration, the patient experienced dyspnea, productive cough, myalgia, and night sweats. The patient became hypoxemic with an oxygen saturation of 75%, a heart rate of 120 bpm, a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and a temperature of 38°C. Chest CT revealed diffuse ground glass nodules associated with parenchymal opacities with air bronchogram at the inferior lung lobe in addition to disseminated thickening of the interlobular interstitium related to acute interstitial lung disease. Subsequent axial chest CT showed diffuse interstitial pneumopathy associated with decreased pulmonary mass, thickening of the interlobular interstitium with bronchial wall thickening, and ground glass opacities. The patient was started on intravenous and oral corticotherapy. Despite corticotherapy, the patient's clinical condition worsened with increasing fever. A further chest CT showed exacerbation of the pre-existing lesions, with the appearance of several ground-glass areas associated with septal thickening forming the crazy paving pattern.

graph_147,True,"Malignant peritoneal mesothelioma (MPeM) is a rare cancer with a poor prognosis at advanced stage, and the standard first-line treatment for inoperable patients is chemotherapy. Although combining programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) inhibitors with chemotherapy is generally considered safe and effective in several malignant solid tumors, there are few reports regarding initial immunochemotherapy in advanced MPeM. This case report presents the first known case of a treatment-naïve patient with epithelioid subtype MPeM who benefited from initial PD-1 inhibitor plus standard chemotherapy.

The patient presented with a solid mass in the lower abdomen, which was identified via Computed tomography. A core needle biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of epithelioid subtype MPeM.

The patient received eight cycles of pemetrexed 800 mg (day 1), cisplatin 60/50 mg (day 1–2), and zimberelimab (PD-1 inhibitor) 240 mg (day 1) every 3 weeks.

The patient reported a burning sensation in the abdomen and a sudden weight loss of 10 kg between November and December 2021. Imaging scan revealed an abdominal mass. Clinical symptoms progressively increased.

The patient had a history of untreated hepatitis B for more than 30 years. His ECOG performance status was 0, and vital signs were stable. Immunohistochemical analysis of cells from the abdominal mass revealed positive staining for calretinin, Wilm’s tumor gene 1, D2-40, and cytokeratin 5/6; weakly positive staining for desmin; and negative staining for SMA, Dog-1, Bcl-2, HMB45, Melan-A, and CD99. Abdominal CT revealed a solid mass in the abdomen (8.9 cm × 5.2 cm) with multiple lesions in the omentum and abdominal cavity, as well as a cystic mass in the lower abdomen.

Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with stage III MPeM (cT3N0M1) via core needle biopsy.

From January to March 2022, the patient received pemetrexed 800 mg (day 1), cisplatin 60 mg (day 1–2), and zimberelimab 240 mg (day 1), every 3 weeks for four cycles.

During treatment, the patient experienced a moderate increase in serum creatinine to 116.6 μmoI/L.

Due to the elevated serum creatinine (53–106 μmoI/L) caused by cisplatin, the cisplatin dosage was reduced to 50 mg from the fifth cycle onward. The patient received three additional cycles of pemetrexed, cisplatin and zimberelimab.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed early ischemic change in the insular cortex and frontotemporal lobe and left internal carotid artery (ICA) terminal occlusion was confirmed by magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA). Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) with contact aspiration by a Penumbra ACE 68, followed by combined technique with a stent retriever was performed, and a soft, fragile embolus was retrieved. Finally, good recanalization was achieved (Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction [TICI] scale 2b), and on the next day, the right hemiparesis and aphasia were improved. The retrieved embolus was examined pathologically and diagnosed as mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the same type as his lung cancer. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed that tumor invaded the right pulmonary vein and left atrium; these findings suggested that a piece of the tumor in the left atrium flowed into the left ICA and caused the acute ischemic stroke. However, the patient’s general condition gradually worsened, and 43 days after thrombectomy, he died from respiratory failure. Cerebral tumor embolism is a rare cause of acute ischemic stroke, and extracardiac carcinoma is an extremely rare cause. Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) is standard therapy for acute ischemic stroke with large vessel occlusion (LVO), and tumor embolism is a rare cause.

After systemic treatment with glucocorticoids, the patient's skin lesions were reduced. Selpercatinib is a RET-specific kinase inhibitor approved for RET-altered thyroid and NSCLC tumors. The rearranged during transfection (RET) gene was first identified as an oncogenic driver in NSCLC in 2012. KIF5B-RET is a common RET gene fusion partner in lung cancer. The LIBRETTO-001 trial indicated that selpercatinib has durable and safe anti-tumor activity and excellent intracranial efficacy. However, the trial also indicated that 44% of patients experienced treatment-emergent serious adverse events (SAEs), of which 11% were related to selpercatinib, with drug hypersensitivity being the most common treatment-related SAE. This case provides novel evidence for the treatment of selpercatinib-induced cutaneous eczematous reactions.

graph_152,True,"A 68-year-old non-smoking female patient presented with a near-missed case of occupational pleural malignant mesothelioma. The etiology of malignant mesothelioma is related to exposure to mineral fibers, especially asbestos fibers. Asbestos fibers reach the pleural space where they accumulate, with a subsequent potential risk of inducing pleural fibrosis and tumors. The latency time between the first asbestos exposure and the diagnosis of occupational pleural malignant mesothelioma was 49 years. Malignant mesothelioma has a long latency time (in some cases up to 50–60 years), so the risks related to asbestos exposure should not be forgotten. Increased risk of lung cancer following the inhalation of asbestos fibers, lifetime health monitoring should be considered in people occupationally exposed to asbestos, with an emphasis on the respiratory system. Malignant mesothelioma is a rare and aggressive form of cancer, with a world standardized incidence rate (WSIR) per 100,000 persons in Europe of 1.7 for males and 0.4 for females. Malignant mesothelioma is most frequently located at the pleural level, with approximately 60–70% of cases, followed by the peritoneal (30%) and pericardial (1–2%) localization. It is estimated that 43,000 patients diagnosed with malignant pleural mesothelioma die annually, of which over 10,000 cases are registered in North America, Western Europe, Australia, and Japan. The purpose of this report is to present a nearly missed case of occupational pleural malignant mesothelioma that resulted from a lack of measures to prevent asbestos exposure in the workplace atmosphere; due to a very long latency, the occupational history was overlooked. The patient also had essential hypertension.

graph_153,False,"A 68-year-old white female cadaver with cause of death recorded as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Dissection revealed an enlarged left supraclavicular lymph node (Virchow node) at the jugulo-subclavian venous junction, measuring 3.7 \u00d7 2.4 \u00d7 1.4 cm. Dissection of the left-sided posterior cervical triangle, after reflection of both the platysma and sternocleidomastoid muscles, revealed a Virchow node (VN) in the region of the lesser supraclavicular fossa. The VN was deep to the platysma and clavicular head of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, underlying what would otherwise be considered the lesser supraclavicular fossa. The Virchow node was located immediately lateral to the internal jugular vein and, along with the thoracic duct, was located just superior to the subclavian vein. Underlying the Virchow node was the phrenic nerve, transverse cervical artery, and anterior scalene muscle. The superior pole of the Virchow node was under the inferior aspect of the superior omohyoid muscle at its attachment with its intermediate tendon. The Virchow node was partially obscured at its superior pole by the superior belly of the omohyoid muscle, which was retracted. The node joined the thoracic duct, which joined together with the internal jugular vein to contribute to the subclavian vein. The platysma and sternocleidomastoid muscles were reflected posteriorly, and the proximal half of the clavicle was resected to reveal the Virchow node. The long axis of the Virchow node was oriented parallel to the internal jugular vein and the distal thoracic duct. Virchow node resection revealed tumor enlargement. Histology showed neoplastic cells with a high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, aberrant nuclei and nucleoli, and intra- and extra-cellular mucin within residual lymphoid tissue. Serial sections showed the node almost entirely replaced by metastatic tumor. Right lung weighed 650 g and measured 24.2 \u00d7 11.2 \u00d7 7.0 cm. Left lung weighed 690 g and measured 24.0 \u00d7 11."
graph_153,True,"A 68-year-old white female cadaver, whose cause of death was recorded as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, was found to have an enlarged left-sided supraclavicular lymph node, or Virchow node (VN), during neck dissection. The VN, measuring 3.7 × 2.4 × 1.4 cm, was situated at the jugulo-subclavian venous junction (venous angle), a typical location for a VN. It was deep to the platysma and clavicular head of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, underlying what would otherwise be considered the lesser supraclavicular fossa. The superior pole of the VN was under the inferior aspect of the superior omohyoid muscle at its attachment with its intermediate tendon. The VN was located immediately lateral to the internal jugular vein and, along with the thoracic duct, was located just superior to the subclavian vein. Underlying the VN was the phrenic nerve, transverse cervical artery, and anterior scalene muscle.

The VN was resected and macroscopically assessed, revealing that the node was enlarged by tumor. Histological studies revealed evidence of neoplastic cells, with a high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio and aberrant nuclei and nucleoli, embedded within residual lymphoid tissue. Intra- and extra-cellular mucin was also identified. Comparison of the histopathology of the VN and a parahilar mass revealed marked similarities, indicative of a primary parahilar adenocarcinoma metastatic to the left supraclavicular VN.

The VN was in close proximity to several anatomical structures. The anterior scalene was located posterior to the VN, suggesting that enlargement of the VN may have compressed the anterior scalene muscle. Because the anterior scalene forms the anterior boundary of the scalene triangle, through which the brachial plexus of nerves and the subclavian artery pass, enlargement of the VN may have caused left-sided brachial plexopathy and decreased blood flow into the left upper extremity. The left phrenic nerve was located between the VN and the anterior scalene muscle. Therefore, enlargement of the Virchow node could have encroached upon the left phrenic nerve, potentially contributing to unilateral phrenic neuropathy. It is possible that the VN compressing the phrenic nerve may have contributed to dyspnea in this individual, whose cause of death was listed as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease but was determined to have pulmonary adenocarcinoma and increased alveolar dead space.

graph_154,False,"A 67-year-old woman presented with a three-year history of progressive loss of strength affecting proximal muscles in upper and lower limbs, marked by difficulties in climbing stairs and walking. Symptoms initially fluctuated but became continuous at the time of assessment. No bulbar or respiratory symptoms were reported.

The patient had a past medical history of small cell carcinoma of the lung treated with carboplatin and etoposide. She was a smoker since age 16 and a moderate alcohol drinker. Manual muscle strength testing revealed 5-/5 in proximal upper limbs and 4+/5 in proximal lower limbs. Sensation was preserved to all modalities.

Based on these findings, a diagnosis of Myasthenia Gravis (MG) was considered and subsequently confirmed via repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) and single-fibre electromyography (EMG). Bicipital, patellar and Achilles deep tendon reflexes were absent bilaterally. Electroneurography (nerve conduction studies (NCS)) revealed normal motor and sensory conduction velocities and expected characteristics of the evoked potentials.

Needle EMG of the right vastus lateralis muscle showed no abnormalities. RNS test of the right median nerve showed a >10% amplitude drop from the fourth to the first potential. Single-fibre EMG of the right vastus lateralis muscle showed increased jitter in four of six pairs, with an increased average jitter value and one block.

Single-fibre EMG of the right vastus lateralis muscle showed the presence of an increased jitter and blocking. Anti-acetylcholine receptor (anti-AchR) antibodies (Ab) testing was initially negative (0.38 IU/mL), then showed a grey area of positivity (0.75 IU/mL).

Electromyography (EMG) and neurophysiological tests, including repetitive nerve stimulation and single-fibre electromyography, were performed. Anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies were detected. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of Myasthenia Gravis (MG) was considered.

Further investigation revealed the presence of small cell lung carcinoma. The patient was subsequently diagnosed with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with the carcinoma. Malignant cells were found in the mediastinum's lymph nodes. The patient's weakness was attributed to both MG and Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, both affecting the neuromuscular junction and skeletal muscles. The patient experienced respiratory failure. The small cell lung carcinoma was identified as the underlying cause of the paraneoplastic syndromes.

graph_155,True,"**Case Report: Bilateral Visual Impairment following Combination Chemotherapy with Carboplatin in a Patient with Small Cell Lung Cancer**

**Background:** Platinum-based combination chemotherapy, including cisplatin and carboplatin, are important cytotoxic anti-cancer agents widely used to treat various solid tumors. Carboplatin has a similar effect on survival in small cell lung cancer but generally has a milder toxicity profile compared to cisplatin. Both may cause moderate or severe neurotoxicity, but ocular neurotoxicity from carboplatin is rarely reported.

**Case Presentation:** A 79-year-old man with small cell lung cancer underwent intravenous polychemotherapy consisting of atezolizumab, etoposide, and carboplatin. One week after the second cycle of chemotherapy, he reported bilateral visual loss, with visual acuity reduced to hand motion in both eyes.

Dilated fundus examination revealed retinal arterial narrowing without hemorrhage. Optical coherence tomography showed diffuse choroidal and retinal thinning. Fluorescein angiography revealed significantly delayed circulation without evidence of obstructive lesions. 30-Flicker electroretinogram testing showed a complete absence of cone response in both eyes.

Despite the cessation of chemotherapy, the patient's visual acuity worsened to no light perception in both eyes.

**Conclusions:** Carboplatin combination chemotherapy administered at therapeutic doses can result in irreversible visual loss, a side effect that is not widely acknowledged. When using carboplatin, physicians should be aware of its potential ocular toxicity.

One week after the second cycle of chemotherapy, the patient complained of gradually worsening bilateral vision impairment. The patient has a history of hypertension and cataract surgery in the left eye six months prior. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was hand motion in both eyes. Intraocular pressures were measured at 19 mmHg in the right eye and 18 mmHg in the left eye. No relative afferent pupillary defect was noted. Fundus examination showed optic nerve pallor in the left eye and bilateral retinal arterial narrowing with sclerosis. No retinal hemorrhage, cotton wool spot, or neovascularization observed. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) revealed generalized choroidal and retinal thinning in both eyes and mild cystoid macular edema in the right eye. 30-Flicker electroretinogram testing revealed a completely absent cone response in both eyes. Fluorescein angiography demonstrated significant delayed filling of the choroidal and arterial circulation and abnormal delayed drainage of venous circulation in the inferior arcade. No evidence of obstructive lesions of arteries or veins. Blood routine test, coagulation function, and orbital magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) did not reveal any abnormalities. A diagnosis of ischemic optic neuropathy secondary to carboplatin administration was made. Chemotherapy was planned to be temporarily discontinued pending oncological consultation. Visual acuity aggravated to no light perception even after the cessation of chemotherapy. Fundus photographs and optical coherence tomography (OCT) images showed retinal artery narrowing and sclerosis in both eyes, with more severe manifestations in the peripapillary area.

Chest x-ray showing a large mass in the left hemithorax prompted further investigation with a CT scan. CT scan with enhancement presented a 40 × 30 cm mass involving the left upper lobe of the lung. CT scan revealed a large mass involving the left upper lobe of the lung, leading to a CT-guided biopsy. CT guided biopsy revealed a benign lung tumor. CT guided biopsy revealed a benign lung tumor, leading to a PET/CT scan to further evaluate the mass. PET/CT scan showed a very mild uptake at the level of the nodule (SUV max = 2.3) with no other signs of uptake in other parts of the body. PET/CT scan showed mild uptake at the nodule, leading to the decision for surgical removal via left upper lobectomy. Patient underwent a left upper lobectomy through lateral thoracotomy. Patient underwent a left upper lobectomy, and the specimen was sent for final histology. Final histology showed an IMT of the lung. Final histology revealed an inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) of the lung, with specific cellular marker results.

graph_156,True,"Background: Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) is a rare tumor with obscure etiopathogenesis in which different inflammatory cells and myofibroblastic spindle cells are seen histologically. The inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT), first described by Brunn in 1937, is an extremely rare type of inflammatory pseudo-tumor. In 2002 the World Health Organization classified IMT as an intermediate grade malignancy. One of the most recent discoveries is related to chromosomal translocation involving the ALK gene, which seems to be present in 50% of cases with malignant characteristics.

In April 2018, a 47-year-old woman came to our attention for dyspnea and tachycardia under exertion. A CT guided biopsy gave a diagnosis of benign lung tumor. In April 2018, the patient underwent surgery for tumor mass asportation through lateral thoracotomy. The histology of the tumor was consistent with IMT of the lung. The final histology showed an IMT of the lung.

Our work aims to detect the presence of cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) in a case of IMT of the lung by immunohistochemical testing for the most common CSCs markers, with aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), as well as for the presence of pluripotent transcription factors such as OCT4, SOX-2, NANOG, and C-MYC, which modulate biological CSC activities. The ALDEFLUOR assay, after tissue digestion, was used to identify and sort human lung cancer cells expressing high and low aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity. Immunohistochemically assessed cell positivity for ALDH1A1, SOX2, NANOG, OCT-4, and c-MYC, which are considered as lung cancer stem-like cells markers. ALDHhigh Stem Cells Were Identified in Primary Cells of an IMT of the Lung. Tumor tissue dissociation efficiently released cancer cells characterized by a heterogeneous morphology, as illustrated in the widespread FSC and SSC values. FACS analysis. Cytofluorimetric analysis of ALDHhigh cells in a case of lung myofibroblastic tumor. Immunohistochemical Evaluation of the ALDH1A1, SOX2.

For the first time, we demonstrated the presence of cancer stem cells in a case of IMT of the lung. Patient underwent follow up and no recurrence was observed within a year after surgery. This perspective suggests further studies to understand the possibility of developing recurrence depending on the presence of cancer stem cells.

The CT also showed left upper lobe carcinomatous lymphangitis, scattered nodules in the left lung suggestive of metastasis, mediastinal lymph node enlargement in zone 6, and a small left pleural effusion, along with old fractures of the right 2nd-4th ribs.

A bronchoscopic biopsy performed at the reporting hospital revealed a biphasic, low-grade malignant mesenchymal tumor with abundant cells and vessels, raising suspicion for epithelioid hemangioendothelioma or angiosarcoma.  A second opinion with immunohistochemistry at the Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, revealed scant tumor tissue with epithelioid and short spindle cell morphology and necrosis, suggesting a low-grade malignancy. Immunohistochemistry was uninformative, and a repeat biopsy was recommended.

**Clinical Case Report**

**Patient Demographics:** Due to the limited data, specific patient demographics (age, sex, ethnicity, etc.) are unavailable. This case report represents a composite scenario based on the listed diagnoses.

**Timeline of Diagnoses, Treatments, and Outcomes:**

The patient's medical history is complex and spans several decades, marked by a series of respiratory and oncological diagnoses.

*   **Early Exposure and Initial Respiratory Issues:** The patient likely had significant occupational exposure to silica dust, leading to the development of **silicosis** and subsequently **pneumoconiosis**. This exposure may have occurred many years prior to the initial diagnosis. The patient also developed **emphysematous chronic bronchitis**, likely exacerbated by the pneumoconiosis and potentially smoking history (though this is not explicitly stated).

*   **Balkan Syndrome:** The patient was diagnosed with **Balkan syndrome**, suggesting residence or exposure to environmental factors in the Balkan region. This syndrome may have contributed to the overall disease burden.

*   **Initial Cancer Diagnosis:** At some point, the patient was diagnosed with **mucoepidermoid carcinoma**. The location of this carcinoma is not specified, but given the other diagnoses, it is plausible it was in the respiratory tract. Treatment details are unavailable, but standard treatment would likely have involved surgical resection, potentially followed by radiation therapy.

*   **Subsequent Cancer Diagnoses:** The patient was later diagnosed with **breast cancer**. Treatment details are unavailable, but standard treatment would likely have involved surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy, depending on the stage and characteristics of the tumor. The patient was also diagnosed with **lung cancer**. Treatment details are unavailable, but standard treatment would likely have involved surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy, depending on the stage and characteristics of the tumor.

*   **Malignant Mesothelioma:** The patient developed **malignant mesothelioma**, specifically **pleural malignant mesothelioma**. This diagnosis is strongly associated with asbestos exposure, suggesting a potential occupational or environmental exposure history. Treatment options for mesothelioma are limited and often involve a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. The prognosis for mesothelioma is generally poor.

*   **Pneumothorax:** The patient experienced a **pneumothorax**, which could be spontaneous, secondary to the underlying lung diseases (pneumoconiosis, emphysema, lung cancer, mesothelioma), or iatrogenic (related to a medical procedure). Treatment would have involved chest tube placement to re-expand the lung.

**Overall Outcome:**

Given the multiple serious diagnoses, including several cancers and chronic respiratory diseases, the patient's prognosis is likely poor. The presence of malignant mesothelioma, in particular, carries a grave prognosis. The patient's quality of life would likely be significantly impacted by the chronic respiratory symptoms and the side effects of cancer treatments. The specific cause of death is not specified, but it would likely be related to complications from one or more of the diagnosed conditions.

graph_163,True,"A man in his 40s with recurrent malignant pleural mesothelioma was administered carboplatin (CBDCA) + pemetrexed (PEM) as a third-line treatment. He had a history of rarely experiencing mild akathisia-like symptoms on his feet before the diagnosis. He reported mild degradation of similar symptoms during a previous cisplatin (CDDP) + PEM treatment, which did not require pharmacotherapy.

Approximately 7 days after the first cycle of CBDCA + PEM, the patient's akathisia-like symptoms notably worsened and persisted. The symptoms were more pronounced during the daytime and lessened at night. Lorazepam (0.5 mg) was administered three times daily from day 14, but it proved ineffective.

The symptoms were attributed to CBDCA-induced neuropathy, given the patient's prior experience with similar symptoms during CDDP + PEM treatment and the absence of other potential causes of akathisia. Pregabalin 75 mg twice daily was initiated, resulting in significant symptom improvement. The patient reported symptom recurrence approximately 10 hours after each pregabalin dose, suggesting that the medication's effect diminished over time.

graph_164,True,"Abstract: This case report describes a patient presenting with pericardial tamponade, found to have small-cell lung carcinoma and malignant pleural effusion, leading to pericardial effusion. The patient underwent pericardial-window-opening surgery.

Introduction: Pericardial tamponade can arise from various etiologies, including trauma, malignancy, end-stage renal disease, iatrogenic causes, and idiopathic origins. This case highlights a presentation secondary to malignancy.

Case Report: A patient presented with pericardial tamponade. Further investigation revealed the patient had small-cell lung carcinoma and malignant pleural effusion, resulting in pericardial effusion. The patient also had a history of chronic obstructive chest disease. The patient experienced hypotension and arrhythmia. The patient underwent pericardial-window-opening surgery.

Discussion: The differential diagnosis and management of pericardial tamponade are discussed, including considerations for ascites, morbid obesity, breast cancer surgery, thoracotomy, rib fractures, corrosive stricture, chest pain, motor vehicle accident, diabetes mellitus, high blood pressure, obstructive sleep apnea, pneumothorax, hemothorax, and rib fracture pain.

A 65-year-old male with small-cell lung carcinoma, diagnosed 6 months prior, was scheduled for pericardial-window-opening surgery (lateral thoracotomy approach). Emergency preoperative evaluation revealed severe chronic obstructive chest disease, bilateral malignant pleural effusion in the lungs and pericardial effusion, deemed too risky for general anesthesia. His heart rate was 126 bpm, blood pressure 75/35 mmHg, and SpO2 75%. The patient had no comorbidities, no history of surgery or allergy, but a smoking history of 100 pack years. Complete blood count, coagulation functions, and biochemical parameters were normal. Vital signs were monitored using three-lead electrocardiography and noninvasive blood pressure and SpO2 monitors. Peripheral venous access was established, and saline infusion started at 30 cm3/h. Oxygen was delivered at 4 l/min via oxygen mask. The patient was placed in semi-Fowler position. An ultrasound system was used with a 6-18 MHz linear probe. The needle puncture point was anesthetized with 2% lidocaine. A 21-ga, 10-cm stimulating needle was introduced under ultrasound guidance. After negative aspiration, the plane between the latissimus dorsi and serratus anterior muscles was filled with 15 cm3 of 0.5% bupivacaine plus 5 cm3 saline in 5 cm3 aliquots. 4 cm3 of 0.5% bupivacaine was injected in the fifth and sixth intercostal region for additional analgesia. Adequate analgesia in the operation zone involving the dermatomes T3–T6 was confirmed. Surgery commenced. The surgery was performed via semi-oblique incision in the fourth intercostal region. Intravenous administration of 2 mg midazolam and 30 mg propofol was given. No severe hypotension or arrhythmia occurred. The patient reported no pain, even without local anesthetics. Ventilation was supported manually as needed; spontaneous breathing was maintained. The surgery lasted 45 minutes. The patient was fully orientated and cooperative upon transfer to postanesthesia care unit for postoperative follow-up.

Separately, a 63-year-old male patient presented with severe chest pain of the left hemithorax following a motor vehicle accident. He had a BMI of 44 and a history of diabetes mellitus, high blood pressure, and obstructive sleep apnea. He sustained broken fourth to seventh ribs without pneumothorax or hemothorax. He was unable to lie supine. A serratus anterior plane block was performed with the patient in the sitting position due to his inability to lie supine. The patient experienced no pain for 10 h postoperatively.

In another case, an 82-year-old man fell onto a table and fractured his fourth to ninth right ribs.

Finally, a 65-year-old woman was struck by a car and sustained fractured fifth to seventh left ribs. A serratus anterior plane block was performed in the posterior axillary line using an 18-ga Touhy needle to inject 20 cm3 of 0.125% bupivacaine followed by a continuous infusion. The patient's pain began to diminish 15 min after the procedure, and she was able to undergo respiratory physiotherapy. In a separate instance, the serratus plane block was administered to patients in the lateral decubitus position toward the posterior axillary line using 30 cm3 of 0.5% ropivacaine."

The bladder cancer exhibited muscle invasion. The patient underwent a transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT), which revealed urothelial carcinoma. Subsequently, a radical cystectomy with ileal conduit was performed. Pathology revealed high-grade pT1 urothelial carcinoma with lymphovascular invasion. Incidentally, Gleason 3+3=6 prostatic adenocarcinoma was also discovered.

Later, the patient developed right-sided flank pain and was diagnosed with metastatic urothelial carcinoma. First-line treatment consisted of cisplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy. Due to progression of bony metastases, palliative radiotherapy was administered. The patient then developed quadriparesis secondary to a C6 metastasis. The patient underwent metastatic tumor resection, cervical decompression, and cervical fixation. The case also mentions uveal melanoma, cutaneous melanoma, mesothelioma, and renal cell carcinoma, but the relationship of these malignancies to the patient's history is not specified. The presence of a hotspot somatic variant was also noted, but its relevance to the case is unclear without further information.

The patient also reported anorexia, nausea, and a lack of energy for about 2 weeks.

The patient had a past surgical history of ORIF left tibia with nail placement following a traumatic tibial fracture. His social history included daily marijuana use, a 1 pack per day smoking habit for 30 years, no alcohol or drug use, and unemployment. On physical exam, his vitals were: BP 116/65, T 98.5 degrees Fahrenheit, RR 16, SPO2 100% on room air. Extremities showed moderate dactylitis of all fingers and toes, pain to palpation of hands and feet, left knee pain with restricted movement, pain and swelling over the left ankle, and widespread finger clubbing.

The patient was found to have microcytic anemia (new from 1 year prior). A chest X-ray revealed a large oval mass in the right upper lobe, which may represent a bulla or soft tissue mass. He was admitted to the general medical floor and worked up for arthritis, with differential diagnoses including rheumatoid arthritis, seronegative spondyloarthropathy, disseminated gonococcal infection, or septic arthritis. He was started on scheduled NSAIDs and oral glucocorticoids for symptomatic treatment of arthritis.

Further investigation with a follow-up CT scan revealed severe emphysema and a 6.5 cm x 8.7 cm x 5.8 cm mass in the right upper lobe. A comprehensive metabolic panel was performed.

Urinalysis was performed. An acute hepatitis panel and HIV screen were both negative. The sedimentation rate was elevated at 125 mm/HR (reference 0–15).

Seven months after the diagnosis, large left pleural and pericardial effusion was detected. The patient developed both chylothorax and chylopericardium following superior vena cava (SVC) obstruction with mediastinal lymphadenopathy caused by lung carcinoma. Since conservative treatment of the chyle leakage was ineffective, we administered radiotherapy to treat the SVC obstruction and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. After radiotherapy, the chylothorax and chylopericardium gradually resolved, and no further chyle leaks were identified on follow-up computed tomography. This case indicates that radiotherapy can be used to ameliorate lung cancer-related chylothorax and chylopericardium.

Following the chest CT findings, a transbronchial lung biopsy was performed, which revealed adenocarcinoma. After the adenocarcinoma diagnosis, mutational analysis and further imaging were performed. Mutational analysis for EGFR, ALK, ROS1, and BRAF were negative. PD-L1 tumor proportion score was 20%. Brain MRI showed brain metastases. PET/CT showed no other distant metastases. Based on the diagnostic workup, the patient was diagnosed with cT4N2M1c, stage IVB lung adenocarcinoma. The patient then underwent stereotactic radiotherapy for brain metastases, followed by 4 cycles of cisplatin (75 mg/m2) with pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) as first-line therapy and 3 cycles of pembrolizumab (200 mg/body) as second-line therapy. Despite treatment, the chemotherapies were ineffective, and the patient was considered to have progressive disease (PD) based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. Chest radiography showed massive left pleural effusion and pericardial effusion. The patient's condition worsened, leading to hospital admission in May 2019. Admission chest X-ray showed a mediastinal mass, left pleural effusion, and enlarged cardiac silhouette.

Laboratory evaluation demonstrated normal WBC count, elevated CRP (140 mg/l) and slightly elevated PCT (0.8 ng/ml) as well as increased liver function tests (below twice the ULN). Repeated blood cultures were negative. Percutaneous ultrasound-guided drainage of the abscesses at the left kidney and the liver was performed, yielding blood-stained serous fluid, cytologically described as abscess without tumor cells. Microbiological culture as well as screening for extrapulmonary tuberculosis or atypical mycobacteriosis including Ziehl–Neelsen staining and PCR was negative. Endoscopic examination of the colon and transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography showed no source of infection. Intravenous treatment with piperacillin/tazobactam was ineffective.

"
graph_171,True,"Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most prevalent histologic subtype of lung cancer and accounts for almost half of all lung cancer deaths because of its indolent clinical presentation and its peripheral location in the lung parenchyma. Despite rapid improvements in lung cancer prevention through smoking cessation and screening programmes, as well as targeted and multi-modality therapies in the last few decades, lung cancer remains a dreadful disease. While the incidence and mortality of many other types of lung cancer such as squamous cell lung carcinoma and small cell lung carcinoma are continuously dropping in more developed countries where smoking incidence is declining, LUAD incidence and mortality are constantly rising, a phenomenon ascribed to the changing face of manufactured cigarettes and the increasing occurrence of LUAD in nonsmokers. Such lung cancer initiating and stem cells possess self-renewal properties and are able to execute programmes of repair and normal tissue replacement during precarcinogenesis and established carcinogenesis. To this end, p63(+)Krt5(+) distal airway stem cells likely relevant to airway basal cells have been shown to maintain and repopulate the airway and alveolar epithelium following viral injury, while club cell secretory protein (CCSP)-expressing club cells have also been shown to be capable of maintaining and repairing smaller bronchioles and alveolar structures. Heredity can also indirectly cause cancer by influencing our interactions with the environment, as is the case with a single nucleotide polymorphism in the habenular nicotinergic acetylcholine receptor which renders individuals susceptible to nicotine addiction and thereby to COPD, lung cancer and peripheral arterial disease. Environmental carcinogens are thought to be even more important than heredity in precipitating chest tumours in humans. Radiation has also been tightly linked with lung cancer development based on a number of different data sources, including atom bomb survivors, nuclear plant workers, uranium miners, radiotherapy patients, and participants of lung cancer screening programmes. As a result, several mutant Kras/KRAS knock-in and Trp53 knockout mouse models have been generated, with the most widely used among them being the Lox

Whole-body fluorine-18-flurodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and CT scan showed uptakes in the mass and the right hilar lymph nodes with standard uptake value max of 16 and 4.7, respectively. Sputum cytology and bronchoscopic examination confirmed squamous cell carcinoma. Further investigation revealed no distant metastasis, including brain metastasis on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The tumor was staged as cT2aN1M0.

The patient subsequently developed neurological symptoms, leading to a diagnosis of paraneoplastic neurological syndrome. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed longitudinally extended edematous lesions in the spinal cord. Cerebrospinal fluid examination was positive for anti-Aquaporin 4 (AQP4) antibody. These findings, in conjunction with the squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, led to a diagnosis of paraneoplastic neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD), specifically paraneoplastic neuromyelitis optica.

The patient underwent lung resection for the squamous cell carcinoma. Post-operatively, the patient experienced a recurrence of neurological symptoms and neuromyelitis optica, potentially triggered by surgical stress and epidural anesthesia. Treatment included steroid pulse therapy and plasma exchange. The patient's case highlights the association between malignant tumors, particularly squamous cell carcinoma, and neurological paraneoplastic syndromes, specifically anti-AQP4 antibody-positive neuromyelitis optica. Tumor detection and treatment, along with immunosuppressive therapies, are crucial in managing these complex cases.

Radical surgical resection remains the standard for diagnosis, staging, and treatment in patients with localized non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), including stage I NSCLC. In addition to parenchymal resection, systematic nodal dissection (SND) is recommended. However, SMD is performed in less than 40% of patients with stage I NSCLC and can eventually associate complications such as chylothorax, pleural effusion, bleeding, bronchial fistula, oesophageal injury, and nerve damage.

A prospective, observational, single-centre study was conducted to assess the feasibility and prognostic value of SLN mapping by fluorescence imaging with ICG in lung cancer surgery. The inclusion criteria consisted of adult patients with proven or suspected peripheral surgically resectable NSCLC, without evidence of lymph node disease in the preoperative study who underwent robotic anatomical lung resection with SND between September 2020 and June 2022.

Further analyses focus on patients who had a successfully identified SNL (17 cases) and whose pathological examination confirmed a primary lung malignancy (14 cases). In one case, invasion of the SLN by metastasis was identified, corresponding to a lymph node upstaging of 7.1%.

graph_181,True,"Small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) is an aggressive solid tumor with a prognosis that has not significantly improved in 25 years. Approximately 13% or 29,000 of all lung cancers annually in the United States are SCLC. The vast majority of these patients are current or former smokers. SCLC is characterized by a high proliferation rate, rapid doubling time, and early development of distant metastases. Approximately 70 percent of patients present with overt metastatic disease. Limited stage (LS) disease, defined as tumor confined to one radiation field, is potentially curable with combination chemotherapy and radiation, but most patients will eventually relapse with distant disease and ultimately succumb to the disease. Even in patients who present with extensive stage disease (defined as disease spread beyond one radiation field), SCLC is almost uniformly responsive to initial chemotherapy and radiation therapy; however, early relapse is common. This case report presents a patient with SCLC harboring a novel MYCL1 fusion protein who experienced a prolonged disease course due to the use of Aurora A kinase inhibitor and subsequently nivolumab. MYC family genes are master regulators of several cellular pathways including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis and recently have been shown to be involved in tumor immune evasion. Large studies have shown that a significant proportion of patients with SCLC have amplification or overexpression of MYC family genes. Preclinical data have exposed vulnerability of MYC-driven tumors to Aurora kinase inhibitors, bromodomain and extraterminal domain inhibitors, and recently to immune checkpoint blockers.

graph_182,True,"Based on the provided data, a clinical case report can be reconstructed focusing on the mentions of *HER2* and *BRCA2*.  However, without further context, the report will be limited and speculative.

**Clinical Case Report**

This case report describes a patient with potential genetic predispositions and/or diagnoses related to *HER2* and *BRCA2*. Due to the limited data, specific patient demographics, timeline of diagnoses, treatments, and outcomes are inferred.

**Patient Demographics:**

*   Demographics are unknown due to the limited data. We lack information on age, sex, ethnicity, and medical history.

**Timeline of Diagnoses:**

*   The repeated mention of *HER2* suggests a possible diagnosis of *HER2*-positive cancer, most likely breast cancer, although other *HER2*-related cancers are possible. The frequency of the *HER2* mentions could indicate multiple assessments, monitoring, or treatment stages related to this marker.
*   The presence of *BRCA2* suggests a genetic test revealed a *BRCA2* mutation. This mutation increases the risk of breast, ovarian, and other cancers. The timing of this diagnosis relative to the *HER2* diagnosis is unknown. It could have been pre-existing (indicating increased risk), concurrent (informing treatment decisions), or subsequent (influencing surveillance).

**Treatments:**

*   Given the likely *HER2*-positive cancer diagnosis, treatments would likely include *HER2*-targeted therapies such as trastuzumab, pertuzumab, or T-DM1. Chemotherapy and/or surgery may also be part of the treatment plan.
*   The *BRCA2* mutation may influence treatment decisions. For example, PARP inhibitors might be considered if the cancer is advanced. Prophylactic surgery (mastectomy, oophorectomy) might be discussed to reduce the risk of future cancers, especially if the *BRCA2* mutation was identified before the *HER2*-positive cancer diagnosis.

**Outcomes:**

*   The outcome is unknown. The repeated mentions of *HER2* could indicate ongoing monitoring of treatment response, disease progression, or recurrence. Without further information, it is impossible to determine whether the patient is in remission, experiencing disease progression, or has passed away. The impact of the *BRCA2* mutation on the overall outcome is also unknown.

graph_183,True,"<h1>Corneal ulcer development due to sintilimab-anlotinib combination therapy-induced dry eye: a case report</h1>

To our knowledge, this is the first case report describing corneal ulcers secondary to dry eye in a patient treated with the combination of PD-1 inhibitor sintilimab and multi-targeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) anlotinib.

A 65-year-old woman with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and bone metastases, without pre-existing ocular conditions, experienced mild dry eye symptoms 1 month following treatment with sintilimab (200 mg q3w) in combination with anlotinib (12 mg q3w). Unrelieved dry eye symptoms occurred after the third cycle of chemotherapy, and she was diagnosed with dry eye syndrome. Her corneal epithelial damage did not improve significantly, and within the following 2 months, her vision decreased in both eyes and progressed to bilateral corneal ulcers. Oral administration of sintilimab and anlotinib was interrupted, and treatments such as corticosteroids, anti-inflammatory drugs, and corneal repair were administered; however, both eyes presented with corneal subepithelial defect and corneal scarring.

This is the first case report of a corneal ulcer caused by programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) inhibitor sintilimab combined with multi-targeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor anlotinib. Anlotinib may destabilize the internal environment of the ocular surface, resulting in lack/imbalance of tear film growth factors, delayed healing of corneal cells, dry eye, and ultimately lead to corneal ulcer. As they increase the immune response, PD-1 inhibitors can act on other normal cells on the ocular surface, causing dry eye syndrome, indirectly or directly damaging corneal epithelial cells, and resulting in corneal ulcers. The development of corneal epithelial disorders in patients receiving target therapy and immunotherapy may not be reversed by reducing its dose.

Ophthalmologists should be aware of eye side effects in patients using immunotherapy to ensure appropriate treatment and minimize potential eye complications such as dry eye and conjunctivitis.

Nivolumab showed durable antitumor effect in patients with recurrent MPM and was approved for those patients in Japan in 2018. Immune related adverse event (irAE) is occurred in various organs and is suggestive to be related to better outcome of nivolumab.

graph_187,False,"A 42-year-old woman presented in early October 2020 with general malaise and anorexia lasting for 3 months and was admitted. She was diagnosed with advanced right upper lung cancer with multiple brain and bone metastases (Fig. 1A–E). The clinical stage of her cancer was T1bN3M1b, stage 4B. She developed severe anaemia (haemoglobin: 6.8 g/dL) and thrombocytopenia (4.2\u00d7104/\u03bcL). Coagulopathy was indicated by elevated fibrin degradation products (144.4 \u03bcg/mL) and D-dimer (33.5 \u03bcg/mL). Prothrombin time-international normalised ratio was 1.87. Carcinoembryonic antigen and ferritin were 7763 ng/mL and 4061 ng/mL, respectively. She received transfusion of erythrocytes and platelets, and infusion of thrombomodulin alfa. Following bronchoscopy, empirical cytotoxic chemotherapy with carboplatin and nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel was initiated. Histopathology revealed lung adenocarcinoma. In mid-October, she was transferred to another hospital to receive multidisciplinary cancer therapy. She received a transfusion of erythrocytes and platelets twice. Enhanced computed tomography revealed an asymptomatic pulmonary thromboembolism. Heparin administration was initiated."
graph_188,False,"In December 2019, the patient was diagnosed with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC) with metastases to the thoracic and abdominal lymph nodes.

In May 2020, systemic chemotherapy (carboplatin/etoposide/atezolizumab) was delayed due to a port infection. The patient then received four treatment cycles of carboplatin/etoposide/atezolizumab and was placed on maintenance atezolizumab.

In August 2020, the patient was diagnosed with metastatic brain lesions and received stereotactic radiation surgery.

In early April 2022, the patient presented with a 4-week history of a gradually worsening visual field defect.

In May 2022, a brain MRI confirmed three stable brain lesions.

The patient was diagnosed with CMV retinitis based on fundoscopic examination and started on oral ganciclovir.

On May 11, 2022, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of the left eye was 20/20, and anterior and posterior segment examinations were normal. Best-corrected visual acuity of her right eye was 20/30. Confrontational visual fields showed superior and nasal visual field defects. Right eye examination revealed: Intraocular pressure of 31 mmHg. Funduscopic examination showed a yellow-white retinal lesion with associated retinal hemorrhages extending from the inferior disk and macula to the inferior and inferotemporal periphery. Optical coherence tomography showed outer retinal fluid extending from the optic disk toward the fovea with mild subfoveal fluid. Anterior segment examination was unremarkable without cell or flare. Right eye examination revealed: Small preretinal hemorrhage along the nasal disk. Optical coherence tomography shows nasal outer retinal fluid with subretinal fluid beneath the fovea. Serum testing for CMV was positive for IgG and negative for IgM. Additional tests for infectious retinitis, including syphilis, tuberculosis, and toxoplasmosis, were negative. An anterior chamber tap was performed and sent for CMV, varicella-zoster viruses, and herpes simplex viruses Type 1 and Type 2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses.

Ganciclovir was injected intravitreally, oral valganciclovir was discontinued, and IV ganciclovir treatment was initiated. One week later, PCR tests returned negative, and the funduscopic appearance was unchanged."
graph_188,True,"A case of retinal metastasis from small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) is reported. The presentation mimicked cytomegalovirus retinitis.

A 48-year-old woman presented with a 4-week history of a visual field loss in her right eye. She had a medical history of extensive-stage SCLC with brain metastasis, stable on maintenance atezolizumab for 2 years. On initial presentation, she was diagnosed with cytomegalovirus retinitis. No improvement was observed with 4 weeks of oral valganciclovir. Upon referral for a second opinion, her fundus examination appeared compatible with cytomegalovirus retinitis, and anterior chamber tap for polymerase chain reaction for viral etiologies was performed followed by intravitreal and IV ganciclovir without improvement. She was referred for a third opinion, where diagnostic vitrectomy with vitreous and retinal biopsies were consistent with SCLC metastatic to the retina.

Intense antiviral treatment was initially administered without improvement. Vitrectomy and retinal biopsy revealed metastatic retinal involvement. Enucleation of the right eye was performed for definitive pathologic analysis, and additional systemic chemotherapy was initiated.

Retinal metastasis should be considered in patients initially diagnosed with viral retinitis who fail to improve despite antiviral therapy, particularly if they have a known history of malignancy. Furthermore, retinal metastasis of SCLC potentially could be misdiagnosed histopathologically as retinoblastoma if the patient's history is unknown and appropriate immunohistochemical stains are not performed.

graph_189,False,"In June 2023, a 59-year-old female patient was admitted to the hospital due to an allergic reaction to aminopyrine. During the workup, a chest CT scan revealed a mass-like soft tissue density shadow (51 mm x 34 mm) in the posterior basal segment of the right lower lobe, suggestive of lung cancer. Small branches of the pulmonary artery surrounded the mass, and the adjacent right lower pulmonary vein was compressed. Multiple enlarged lymph nodes were identified in the bilateral supraclavicular fossa, mediastinum (2R, 4R, 5 area, 7 area), and bilateral pulmonary hilum, with the largest in the 4R area (short diameter approximately 10 mm). A slightly enhanced nodule was also noted in the right upper lobe. Subsequent head MRI showed abnormal signals in the right frontotemporal region, raising suspicion for metastasis. A CT-guided percutaneous lung biopsy was performed, and microscopic examination confirmed lung adenocarcinoma with typical papillary and micropapillary structures and invasive growth. The clinical stage was determined to be cT4N3M1b IVA. In July 2023, DNA/RNA-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) of lung adenocarcinoma tissue sections revealed an EGFR G719A mutation (exon 18 c.2156G>C, mutation abundance 33.92%) and an LMNA-NTRK1 fusion mutation [LMNA(chr1:156100564)-NTRK1(chr1:156844698) L2N11]. FISH validation confirmed the NTRK fusion positivity with an NTRK break-apart probe showing separation signals. Based on the NGS results revealing the EGFR G719A mutation, the patient was started on oral targeted therapy with Afatinib (30 mg once daily) in July 2023. One month later, follow-up was scheduled."
graph_189,True,"This clinical case report describes a patient diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), specifically lung adenocarcinoma. The patient's tumor harbored several mutations, including EGFR G719A, EGFR 19del, and T790M. Additionally, the tumor exhibited an LMNA-NTRK1 fusion.

Initially, the patient likely received first-line treatment with EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as gefitinib, erlotinib, or afatinib, given the presence of EGFR mutations (19del and G719A). The development of the T790M mutation suggests acquired resistance to these first-generation EGFR TKIs. Subsequently, the patient was likely treated with osimertinib, a third-generation EGFR TKI specifically designed to overcome T790M resistance.

Given the LMNA-NTRK1 fusion, the patient may have also been considered for treatment with NTRK inhibitors such as larotrectinib or entrectinib.

Other treatments mentioned, such as pemetrexed disodium and carboplatin, suggest the patient may have received chemotherapy, possibly in combination with EGFR TKIs or NTRK inhibitors, or as a later line of therapy. Aminopyrine is also listed, but its relevance to the cancer treatment is unclear without further context.

The report also mentions breast cancer, salivary gland cancer, and infantile fibrosarcoma. It is unclear if these are previous diagnoses in the same patient, or if they are mentioned in the context of differential diagnosis or potential comorbidities. Without further information, it is impossible to determine the exact timeline and relationship of these cancers to the patient's lung adenocarcinoma.

graph_190,False,"A 46-year-old non-smoking Chinese man presented with a cough for over 1 month and shortness of breath for approximately 10 days. The patient's cough and shortness of breath led to further investigation via CT scan. CT scan revealed hydropneumothorax, compression atelectasis (approximately 80% collapse) and tumor mass of the right lung, and multiple nodules in the left lung. The hydropneumothorax detected on CT scan prompted pleural space drainage. Pleural space drainage revealed malignant cells in the pleural effusion. The malignant cells in pleural effusion led to ultrasound-guided percutaneous lung biopsy. Ultrasound-guided percutaneous lung biopsy showed infiltrating growth of the allotypic glandular duct, and the lesions tend to be pulmonary adenocarcinoma, with strongly positive expression for thyroid CK7, TTF-1, and Napsin A and negative for CK5/6, P40, and P60 as assayed by immunohistochemical staining. The pulmonary adenocarcinoma diagnosis prompted further imaging to assess for metastatic disease. Bone scan, brain CT scan, and ultrasonography of the abdominal system, urinary system, and cardiovascular system identified no evidence of metastatic disease. Imaging ruled out metastatic disease outside of the pleura, leading to final diagnosis. The patient was diagnosed with right lung adenocarcinoma with pleural metastasis (cT4N0M1a, stage IVa)."

The patient was treated with alectinib. After 2 months of alectinib treatment, the targeted lung lesion regressed significantly, and evaluation of therapeutic efficiency indicated a partial response. The patient achieved 12 months of progression-free survival from alectinib treatment. This case extends the spectrum of *ALK* fusion partners in *ALK*-positive non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) and reports the sensitivity of the novel *PPFIA1*-*ALK* and *ALK*-*C2orf91*(intergenic) fusion to alectinib in lung cancer.

She reported no fever, chills, hemoptysis, or chest pain. Her physical examination was unremarkable, and she had a normal medical, family, and psycho-social history. The patient had no hypertension, diabetes, or other basic diseases and was a non-smoker. Laboratory studies were within normal ranges.

Four months after the initial presentation, a chest CT scan revealed an irregular patchy shadow (5.0 x 2.6 cm) in the right lower lobe of the lung with obstruction of the bronchus in the superior segment. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy revealed jelly-like material obstructing the bronchus in the superior segment of the right lower lobe. A bronchoscopy biopsy indicated no malignant cells.

Six months after the bronchoscopy, a follow-up chest CT scan showed an irregular mass (5.2 x 2.9 cm) in the right lower lung, indicating tumor growth and suggesting malignancy. An 18F-FDG PET/CT scan showed high FDG uptake in the proximal area of the mass (SUVmax 5.1), with no increased FDG uptake distally. Based on these findings, a clinical diagnosis of pulmonary malignancy was made, and the patient was scheduled for a right lower lobectomy.

During surgery, an intraoperative frozen section analysis revealed a benign tumor. A right lower lobectomy was performed with no complications. Post-surgery, the patient's persistent cough disappeared.

Histological examination of the resected tissue revealed a jelly-like lesion (5.5 cm) in the right lower lobe, containing a 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm nodule diagnosed as mucinous adenoma. Immunohistochemistry showed positive staining for CK7 and P53, and negative staining for TTF-1, NapsinA, PD-L1, P40, CK5/6, and ALK(D5F3). The Ki-67 proliferation index was 2%."

graph_193,True,"This case report focuses on the treatment of lung cancer, particularly Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene rearrangements and brain metastases. Several instances highlight the use of ALK-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as crizotinib and alectinib in managing these conditions.

The report details cases of advanced NSCLC with brain metastases, where patients were initially treated with crizotinib. In some instances, alectinib was used as a subsequent treatment option, potentially after crizotinib resistance or progression. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) was also utilized in some cases, either alongside or after conventional treatments like crizotinib and erlotinib.

The report also mentions instances of severe complications, including cranial lesions, severe liver damage, and kidney damage, potentially related to the disease progression or treatment side effects. Some patients presented with severe conditions due to extensive brain metastases.

The cases highlight the challenges in treating ALK-positive NSCLC, especially when it has metastasized to the central nervous system (CNS), including the brain. The effectiveness of crizotinib treatment in managing brain metastases (BM) is a recurring theme. The report also touches upon the importance of identifying ALK rearrangements in NSCLC patients to guide treatment decisions.

graph_199,True,"Lung large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (L-LCNEC) is a subtype of lung cancer with a low incidence and a high degree of malignancy. It is also a type of neuroendocrine tumor (NET) and is defined as a non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It accounts for less than 3% of all lung malignancies. It is characterized by invasion, extensive metastasis, and a low survival rate, and its clinical characteristics and prognosis are similar to those of small cell lung cancer (SCLC). A large number of gene mutations have been shown to drive the malignant transformation and cell proliferation of a range of human cancer types, including pulmonary cancer. L-LCNEC with the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene mutation is very rare and currently has no standard therapy. For early stage patients, surgical treatment is limited, and the risk of postoperative recurrence is high. For patients with unresectable or advanced disease, platinum-based chemotherapy is currently the mainstay of treatment, but its efficacy is unsatisfactory.

This article reports the case of a locally advanced L-LCNEC patient with ALK mutations who underwent first-line treatment with alectinib. The patient refused chemotherapy and received first-line treatment with alectinib 600 mg twice daily. After taking alectinib for 1 month, the patient’s chest enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan showed a partial response (PR). After 12 months of treatment with alectinib, a radiological evaluation showed that the patient had maintained the PR. A grade 2–3 rash was observed at the beginning of the treatment. After symptomatic treatment, the rash disappeared, and the side effects were fully tolerated. This case suggests that the first-line use of targeted therapy is also a good choice for L-LCNEC patients of stage III with gene mutations.

A chest CT on the same day revealed a nodule in the right lobe of the lung. The patient returned to the hospital on June 13, 2021, for the same reason. A subsequent chest CT revealed more lesions in the upper lobe of the right lung than before, with significant enlargement of the mediastinal lymph nodes, suggesting likely peripheral lung cancer. The patient was hospitalized on June 16, 2021. A chest CT on June 17, 2021, showed a 19×16×30 mm nodular shadow in the anterior segment of the upper lobe of the right lung, adjacent pleural involvement, and multiple enlarged lymph nodes at 2R and 4R/L in the right hilar and mediastinum. On June 21, 2021, lymph nodes were enlarged to 21 mm, narrowing the superior vena cava lumen, suggesting lymph node metastasis. Ultrasonic bronchoscopy revealed multiple hypoechoic masses in the 4R, 4L, and 7 areas of the mediastinum, right hilar (10R) and right interlobular (11R). The largest lesion was in area 4R, measuring 20.4×30.6 mm. Metastatic lymph node of 4R region (the largest short lymph nodes is 20.4×30.6 mm).

During the initial workup, thyroid nodules were detected on CT. PET-CT revealed strong uptake of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (SUVmax 15.33) in the lung tumor and slightly lower uptake (SUVmax 3.59) in the thyroid tumor. A biopsy of a thyroid sample did not reveal any malignant cells; however, the findings were indicative of a primary differentiated thyroid carcinoma or a benign thyroid tumor. The patient responded to first-line radiochemotherapy. Progression to pulmonary metastasis was noted 10 months after the diagnosis. Nivolumab was started as second-line therapy. After 12 cycles of nivolumab, CT revealed complete response of the pulmonary metastasis to treatment. After 32 cycles of nivolumab, the patient developed pain in the left neck. CT revealed rapid growth of the thyroid tumor with tracheal deviation and left cervical lymphadenopathy. Biopsies of the thyroid tumor and left cervical lymph node were performed. Histological examination suggested that the thyroid tumor and left cervical lymph nodes were composed of poorly differentiated tumor cells with milder nucleolar pleomorphy and hypertrophy compared with the previously biopsied lung tumor tissue. Immunohistochemical staining showed that the thyroid tumor cells were partially positive for cytokeratin (CK) and strongly positive for vimentin."

No GCSF drugs were used during the initial chemotherapy course, and the eosinophil count did not exceed 300. Despite this treatment, the primary tumor enlarged, and diagnostic evaluation indicated progressive disease (PD). Atezolizumab (1500 mg every 3 weeks) was initiated as second-line therapy, resulting in a partial response (PR). After 19 cycles of Atezolizumab, the patient developed daily coughing, wheezing, and nocturnal symptoms.

During paraclinical investigations, chest computed tomography (CT) demonstrated pleural effusion and multiple pulmonary nodules, raising the question of primary mesothelioma or metastasis from a distant focus. Histopathology and immunohistochemical examinations of a pleural biopsy provided evidence of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) of the clear cell type. An abdominal contrast computed tomography (CT) was then performed, revealing a 3 cm right renal mass, which was subsequently removed by partial nephrectomy. The patient's initial presentation of dyspnea was a rare manifestation of RCC, with the pleural involvement being particularly uncommon. The case highlights the importance of considering RCC in the differential diagnosis of dyspnea, even in the absence of typical symptoms.

He had no history of CNS disorders, but his daughter had schizophrenia. He was receiving alectinib for ALK-positive NSCLC. On admission, computed tomography showed ground-glass opacity in the lungs, leading to the discontinuation of alectinib due to suspected drug-induced lung injury, and steroids were initiated. After the lung injury improved, alectinib was switched to lorlatinib 100 mg/d. At the time of switching to lorlatinib, both renal and liver function were normal.

On day 4 after lorlatinib was initiated, the patient experienced auditory hallucinations, followed by visual hallucinations 3 days later. The hallucinations were diagnosed as grade 2-3 CNS disorders. He reported hearing music playing outside the window or close to him, loudly or faintly, and involving familiar and unfamiliar tunes. He noted the music was faint when talking with people. The visual hallucinations ranged from mild, such as curtains approaching him up close and stuffed animals emerging from the ceiling, to severe, including his bed turning into an airplane or train and seeing a variety of magnificent views and cityscapes from the window. Concomitant medications were vonoprazan fumarate (10 mg/d), a precipitated calcium carbonate/cholecalciferol/magnesium carbonate mixture (2 tablets/d), rosuvastatin calcium (2.5 mg/d), aspirin (100 mg/d), a trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole mixture (1 tablets/d), magnesium oxide (990 mg/d), prednisolone (10 mg/d), and torasemide (4 mg/d).

Lorlatinib was discontinued the day after the onset of visual hallucinations, but both the visual and auditory hallucinations persisted for a further 3 days before disappearing on day 4 after discontinuation. Lorlatinib was restarted at 50 mg/d on day 5 after discontinuation, and the visual and auditory hallucinations reappeared the following day. He reported that the visual hallucinations were less powerful and that the auditory hallucinations were about half as loud as before. The specific visual hallucinations included curtains approaching him up close, stuffed animals emerging from the ceiling, and ceiling lights moving. The auditory hallucinations included various pieces of music playing outside the window and above his head. He was diagnosed with grade 1 CNS disorder. There were no findings suspicious for brain metastasis and no medications that could cause delirium. Psychiatrists determined that delirium was unlikely because of the lack of cognitive decline and disorientation.

Six months later, his general condition deteriorated and lorlatinib was discontinued. However, grade 1 auditory hallucinations persisted, sometimes as singing but mostly instrumental and with familiar and unfamiliar pieces. He often experienced these hallucinations in the morning, during quiet times before going to bed, and when it was quiet during the daytime.

graph_204,True,"A case report describes an uncommon presentation of lung adenocarcinoma as a skull mass in an elderly male patient. The patient presented with a progressively enlarging and painful skull mass. Initial imaging revealed a 5 cm soft tissue mass at the dorsal midline of the parietal-occipital bone. The patient had not reviewed the results of the CT scan before coming to the USA. His past medical history was significant for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with a social history of 40-pack-year smoking.

Given the rapid growth of the head mass and the imaging findings, the initial differential diagnosis considered metastatic disease and multiple myeloma. Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) was negative. Consequently, the patient was started on levetiracetam to prevent seizures and referred to the neurosurgery department for further evaluation and management. Subsequent imaging identified a lung mass, and a biopsy of the skull bone confirmed that the mass was metastatic adenocarcinoma originating from the lung. The CT scan revealed a soft tissue mass measuring 39 x 32 mm located at the dorsal midline of the parietal-occipital bone.

For treatment, the patient underwent occipital partial resection of the mass, followed by wire mesh cranioplasty. Chemotherapy and external beam radiotherapy were administered to alleviate symptoms and control the spread of cancer. Lung carcinoma with distant metastasis is generally associated with a poorer prognosis. However, some supporting data suggest that early detection and aggressive management play crucial roles in preventing further metastasis and improving the patient's quality of life and overall survival rate.

A head CT scan performed two weeks prior revealed a 39 x 32 mm soft tissue mass located at the dorsal midline of the parietal-occipital bone.

Physical examination revealed the patient was vitally stable. A palpable, round, non-pulsatile, tender mass measuring 5 x 2 cm was present on the occipital area of the head. Laboratory testing, including complete blood count, renal function test, liver function test, and serum electrolyte levels, showed no abnormalities. A CT scan of the head without contrast revealed a 5 cm soft tissue mass located at the dorsal midline parietal-occipital bone.

CT head without contrast showed a 5.0 x 4.2 x 3.3 cm soft tissue mass centered within the dorsal midline parietal-occipital bone with extension into the epidural space and invasion of the superior sagittal sinus. Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) was negative. The patient was started on levetiracetam to prevent seizures and referred to neurosurgery.

MRI of the brain without contrast showed a lytic mass centered in the posterior midline parietal and occipital bone, measuring approximately 5.1 x 2.6 x 4.0 cm (craniocaudal by anteroposterior by transverse). The mass had eroded through the inner and outer tables of the skull, extending into the epidural space and overlying subcutaneous fat. The mass slightly compressed the underlying parietal and occipital cortex without associated vasogenic edema. CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with contrast revealed a lobulated solid mass measuring 4.8 x 4.2 x 4.6 cm in the right upper lobe of the lung, along with a lytic lesion and pathologic fracture on the posterior aspect of the right 7th rib, a 3 cm soft tissue mass over the right 11th rib, a small lytic lesion on the right iliac wing, and on the right sacral ala.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed multiple clear cystic structures in the pelvis of unknown aetiology. Following discussion by a multidisciplinary team, a diagnostic laparoscopy was performed. Intraoperatively, bilateral endometriomas were identified, along with multiple fluid-filled cystic structures in the pelvis and on the anterior abdominal wall. An adhesiolysis and drainage of endometriomas was performed, and the cystic structures were sent for histology. Histopathology confirmed Benign multicystic peritoneal mesothelioma (BMPM), positive for AE1/3 and calretinin. BMPM is a rare peritoneal tumour. The patient was referred to a mesothelioma malignancy institute and advised to undergo definitive surgery by the local endometriosis team. A joint surgical procedure with a colorectal team involved laparoscopic excision of peritoneal cysts, cystectomy for bilateral endometriomas, and excision of deep infiltrating endometriosis with bowel shaving. Histopathology revealed benign mesothelial cysts with foci of endometriosis. There are 7 documented cases of BMPM coexisting with endometriosis on histology and in the case reported here it was associated with deep infiltrating endometriosis. The patient had an uncomplicated recovery and is planned for long-term follow-up with the mesothelioma malignancy institute due to the high recurrence rate (up to 50 %).

graph_207,True,"Case Report: Detection of Double ROS1 Translocations, SDC4-ROS1 and ROS1-GK, in a Lung Adenocarcinoma Patient and Response to Crizotinib

A 40-year-old male was diagnosed with stage IIIA lung adenocarcinoma. Next-generation sequencing of tumor tissue revealed the presence of two ROS1 fusions: SDC4-ROS1 (EX2:EX32) and ROS1-GK (EX31:EX13).

Given the presence of ROS1 rearrangements, the patient was administered crizotinib. The patient initially showed a partial response in lung lesions. However, at 8 months after the start of crizotinib treatment, a brain lesion was detected.

The patient's response to crizotinib, while initially positive, was relatively short-lived. This may be related to the presence of the ROS1-GK rearrangement. This case suggests that patients with both SDC4-ROS1 and ROS1-GK fusions may be sensitive to crizotinib, but the presence of ROS1-GK rearrangement may affect the efficacy of crizotinib, leading to shorter progression-free survival.

graph_209,True,"Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), infection (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]) outbreak started in Wuhan, Hubei Province, People’s Republic of China, and spread globally. Initially, patients presented with fever with or without respiratory symptoms. Various degrees of pulmonary abnormalities developed later in all patients, visible on chest computed tomography (CT) imaging. Most patients experienced a mild illness, but approximately 15% to 20% required assisted oxygenation. The severe group had a high mortality rate and was associated with older age, underlying diseases such as diabetes, and medical procedures.

Two patients who recently underwent lung lobectomies for adenocarcinoma were retrospectively found to have had COVID-19 at the time of the operation. Pathologic examinations revealed that apart from the tumors, the lungs of both patients exhibited edema, proteinaceous exudate, focal reactive hyperplasia of pneumocytes with patchy inflammatory cellular infiltration, and multinucleated giant cells. Hyaline membranes were not prominent. Because both patients did not exhibit symptoms of pneumonia at the time of operation, these changes likely represent an early phase of the lung pathology of COVID-19 pneumonia.

graph_210,True,"Approximately 2–7% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer harbor anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement events. Typical ALK actionable rearrangements are sensitive to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, different types of ALK fusion influence the clinical outcomes of this therapeutic approach. Approximately 10–40% of patients with ALK-fusion positive non-small cell lung cancer do not respond to ALK-TKI therapy. Therefore, it is important to accurately identify the types of ALK rearrangement for appropriate selection of clinical treatment.

A patient with lung adenocarcinoma was found to have a novel solute carrier family 8 member A1 (SLC8A1)-ALK fusion type using DNA-targeted next-generation sequencing. Further reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Sanger sequencing demonstrated the rearrangement as a B-cell CLL/lymphoma 11A (BCL11A)-ALK fusion at the transcriptional level.

A CT-guided biopsy of the lung tumor tissue was performed. The biopsy revealed NSCLC, stage IVA (cT3N2M1a). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed positive expression for napsin A, Ki-67, thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1), and negative expression for P40, indicating an adenocarcinoma origin of the lung tumor. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining of the biopsy specimen showed a poorly differentiated tumor tissue. DNA-level NGS was performed on the biopsy specimen based on a 10-gene panel (including ALK, BRAF, EGFR, ERBB2, KRAS, MET, PIK3CA, RET, ROS1 and TP53). A novel solute carrier family 8 member A1 (SLC8A1)-ALK fusion type was identified with a mutant allele frequency of 5.98%. RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing confirmed the expression of a BCL11A-ALK fusion on RNA levels, where BCL11A exon 3 rearranged with ALK exon 20. This fusion retained the N-terminal part of BCL11A and the entire kinase domain of ALK. DNA-level analysis revealed a fusion of partial SLC8A1 exon 2 with the last 54 bp of ALK exon 19, and a fusion of partial BCL11A exon 3 with the first 1 bp of ALK exon 20. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) confirmed ALK rearrangement events on a chromosomal level in the biopsy specimen, showing typical positive ALK-rearrangement signals. No EGFR, TP53 and KRAS mutations or ROS1 rearrangement detected. FISH analysis showed fused red-green signals (negative signal), split red-green signals (positive signal) and single red signals (positive signal) in the patient’s biopsy specimen."
graph_211,True,"A 75-year-old woman with a medical history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, thalassemia trait, osteoarthritis of the knees, and hyperthyroidism presented with bloating, abdominal discomfort, and a change in stool caliber that had been occurring for a couple of weeks. She denied any association with fatty diet, alcohol consumption, or dairy intake. She reported no respiratory symptoms, appetite loss, or cachexia and was a lifelong non-smoker. Physical examination was unremarkable, with normal breath sounds, a soft, non-tender abdomen, and no lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, abdominal mass, or stigmata of chronic liver disease. Her medications included calcium carbonate, calciferol, and atenolol.

Due to her age, presentation, and change in stool caliber, she underwent colonoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). Colonoscopy revealed multiple hyperplastic polyps, which were removed. EGD revealed 2 F2 varices and 1 F1 varix in the midesophagus (30-35 cm from the incisors), not extending to the esophagogastric junction. Below the varices, benign squamous papillomata and a venous bleb were noted. No gastric varices were seen. The varices were identified as downhill esophageal varices (DEVs) based on their vertical longitudinal appearance and location.

To investigate the cause of the DEVs, chest x-ray and computed tomography (CT) of the chest and neck were performed. The chest x-ray showed a subtle reticular-ground glass opacity in the right upper zone. CT revealed a 2.7-cm pulmonary nodule located peripherally in the right upper lung, adjacent to the pleura, and far superolateral to the superior vena cava (SVC) without SVC contact or obstruction. Subcentimeter lymph nodes with internal microcalcification were noted at the left cervical IIb level. No thyroid nodules or liver cirrhosis were found.

A lung biopsy was performed, confirming the lesion to be an adenocarcinoma. The patient subsequently underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery with right upper lobe lobectomy and lymph node biopsy. Pathological examination of the surgical specimen revealed a lepidic-predominant invasive adenocarcinoma, with a total size of 2.7 cm and an invasive tumor size of 1.1 cm.

Her medications included calcium carbonate, calciferol, and atenolol.

The patient underwent a colonoscopy, which revealed multiple polyps. These were removed by biopsy forceps and cold snare, and pathological examination identified them as hyperplastic.

The patient also underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), which revealed 2 F2 varices and 1 F1 varix between 30 and 35 cm from the incisors, located in the midesophagus and not extending to the esophagogastric junction. A few benign squamous papillomata and a venous bleb were observed at 39 cm from the incisors, just proximal to the esophagogastric junction. The mucosa distal to the varices was normal, and no gastric varices were seen.

A chest x-ray showed a barely detectable reticular-ground glass opacity in the right upper zone. Subsequent CT of the chest and neck revealed a 2.7-cm pulmonary nodule located at the periphery of the right upper lung, adjacent to the pleura and far superolateral to the SVC without SVC contact and obstruction. No neck mass was seen, but subcentimeter lymph nodes with internal microcalcification were noted at the left cervical IIb level, posterior to the spinal accessory nerve and internal jugular vein.

Surgical margins were clear and the resected intrathoracic lymph nodes were free of metastasis (pathological stage IIB [pT3N0M0]). Adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin 75 mg/m2 on day 1 and vinorelbine 25 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 every three weeks for four cycles was administered. Repeat CT examination eight months post-surgery showed a recurrent tumor at the apex of the remaining right lung measuring 7.0 cm x 6.6 cm x 3.7 cm. Surgical resection of the recurrent tumor and reconstruction of the chest wall was performed. Histopathological examination revealed a high grade pleomorphic sarcoma with no epithelial elements. Tumor cells were strongly positive for vimentin and negative for cytokeratin (CK) 5 and 6, and thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1).

graph_212,True,"A patient with resected stage IIB lung adenosquamous carcinoma (pT3N0M0) underwent adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of four cycles of cisplatin (75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on day 1) and vinorelbine (25 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 1 and 8 every three weeks). The surgical margins were clear, and the resected intrathoracic lymph nodes were free of metastasis. Eight months post-surgery, a repeat CT examination showed a recurrent tumor at the apex of the remaining right lung, measuring 7.0 cm x 6.6 cm x 3.7 cm.

Histopathological examination of the tumor revealed a high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma with no epithelial elements. The tumor cells were strongly positive for vimentin and negative for cytokeratin (CK) 5 and 6, and thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1). This case suggests that adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy, while extending survival in resected NSCLC, may lead to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in disseminated tumor cells (DTC) or circulating tumor cells (CTC), causing recurrence and metastasis.

graph_213,True,"A patient presented with abdominal distention and pain. Examination revealed an intraperitoneal mass. Cytological analysis of peritoneal fluid revealed singly scattered clusters of large pleomorphic cells with an epithelioid morphology, raising suspicion for malignancy. Initial differential diagnoses included spindle cell neoplasm, leiomyosarcoma, and dedifferentiated liposarcoma. Further investigation led to a diagnosis of dedifferentiated liposarcoma. The patient subsequently developed metastatic deposits of dedifferentiated liposarcoma, another intraperitoneal mass, and malignant effusions. The differential diagnosis at this point included spindle cell neoplasm, dedifferentiated liposarcoma, and pleomorphic liposarcoma. Ultimately, the patient was diagnosed with retroperitoneal dedifferentiated liposarcoma.

Contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen revealed an intraperitoneal mass measuring 17 \u00d7 13 cm, located in the mid-abdomen and extending into left lumbar region. The lesion extended posteriorly, encasing the 3rd part of the duodenum, abutting the abdominal aorta, and further extending into the left lumbar region. A trucut biopsy revealed a spindle cell neoplasm on histopathological examination. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining showed SMA+, S100 (patchy +), desmin+, CD34-, ALK-, and CD117-. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of low-grade myofibroblastic/smooth muscle neoplasm was made. Peritoneal fluid analysis revealed benign and reactive mesothelial cells with atypical epithelioid cells (coarse nuclear chromatin, prominent nucleoli, abundant cytoplasm). Cytology showed cells exhibiting binucleation and multinucleation. IHC staining of the cytology sample showed SMA+ and calretinin-. MDM2 IHC showed diffuse nuclear positivity. Cytology was reported as positive for malignancy, suggestive of metastatic deposits of dedifferentiated liposarcoma. A resection specimen revealed a large intraperitoneal mass measuring 18 \u00d7 17 cm with adhered intestinal loops. Histopathology showed a predominantly low-grade, spindle cell neoplasm with areas exhibiting high-grade features, characterized by cells with epithelioid morphology, enlarged nuclei, and multinucleation, consistent with findings from cytological evaluation. IHC staining of the resection specimen showed retained H3K27me3 expression, myogenin and myoD1 negativity, and diffuse MDM2 and p16 positivity. Based on these findings, a final diagnosis of dedifferentiated liposarcoma was made. The postoperative period was uneventful.

graph_215,False,"A 55-year-old male with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) undergoing durvalumab therapy, with a history of membranous nephropathy (MN), experienced nephrotic syndrome (NS) relapse during PD-L1 inhibitor therapy. Eight years prior to the diagnosis of NSCLC, the patient developed NS. The patient was found to have severe generalized swelling. Urinalysis showed major proteinuria, which prompted nephrology referral. The patient, with a medical history of hypertension, tobacco-use disorder, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and depression, presented with moderate pitting edema of the lower extremities. Initial laboratory evaluation revealed serum albumin 2.2 g/dL, LDL 316 mg/dL, creatinine 0.9 mg/dL, 24-h urine protein 11190 mg, and HCV RNA viral load of 6.2 log IU/mL with genotype 3a.

graph_215,True,"A patient with a history of tobacco-use disorder, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and depression presented with shortness of breath and a productive cough. Imaging revealed postobstructive pneumonia, pleural effusion, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Further investigation led to a diagnosis of invasive squamous cell cancer of the lung with lymph node metastasis. The patient was treated with chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin and taxol, followed by radiation therapy.

Subsequently, the patient developed severe generalized swelling and pitting edema, leading to the diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome with significant proteinuria and hypertension. Further workup revealed membranous nephropathy. Given the patient's history of cancer, the membranous nephropathy was suspected to be cancer-related.

The patient was also found to have hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, but the presence of monoclonal proteins suggested the membranous nephropathy was more likely related to the cancer than the HCV infection. Initial treatment included an angiotensin receptor blocker to manage proteinuria and hypertension.

Due to the lung cancer diagnosis, the patient received durvalumab therapy, an immunotherapy. However, the patient's nephrotic syndrome persisted. Given the failure of initial management and the potential link to cancer, immunosuppressive therapy was considered for the membranous nephropathy.

The patient's case is complicated by the presence of non-small cell lung cancer, treated with immunotherapy, and the subsequent development of membranous nephropathy and nephrotic syndrome. The etiology of the membranous nephropathy is uncertain, with possibilities including cancer-related autoimmune disease, or less likely, HCV infection. The patient's history of HCV infection was previously treated with pegylated interferon and oral ribavirin. The patient also developed empyema.

graph_216,True,"A 63-year-old male with a past medical history of heavy tobacco use presented to the emergency department complaining of shortness of breath, palpitations, and cough. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is widely considered to be the most prevalent cardiac arrhythmia with an incidence of roughly 1%-2% in the United States alone. The incidence of AF has been known to increase with advancing age and thus presents a significant burden on healthcare systems across the globe. AF arises as a result of several mechanisms including structural changes that occur in the heart over time. Hypertension has been well-documented to cause an increased risk of developing AF. Long-standing hypertension causes many deleterious effects on the heart including left ventricular hypertrophy resulting in diastolic heart dysfunction. Over time, elevated pressures in the left ventricle can cause left atrial dilation and remodeling which has been known to play a significant role in the development of AF. AF most frequently arises as a result of ectopic beats that originate in the pulmonary veins. The left atrium and pulmonary veins are anatomically continuous structures. As a result, left atrial dilation has major effects on the adjacent pulmonary veins. A much rarer cause of atrial fibrillation includes masses in the mediastinum. This article was presented as a poster at the 2023 Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine Research Day on May 9, 2023.

graph_218,True,"A patient presented with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), an oncogenic addiction often associated with shorter survival. Biomarker analysis and next-generation sequencing (NGS) of tumor tissue genotyping revealed an activating mutation, specifically an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) DEL19 mutation. This made the patient a candidate for targeted therapies using tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).

The patient was initially treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting EGFR. However, the patient subsequently developed severe hepatocellular failure, complicated by thrombotic microangiopathy. This life-threatening hepatocellular failure necessitated discontinuation of the initial anti-cancer treatment.

Further investigation via computerized tomography (CT) scan revealed diffuse bilobar lesions in the liver, along with multiple suspicious diffuse hepatic lesions, sub-diaphragmatic lymphadenopathies, pleural effusion, diffuse bone, and pulmonary lesions. A liver biopsy was performed, with immunohistochemistry showing CK7+, CK20-, TTF1+, SATB2-, and GATA 3- staining, consistent with a mucus-secreting carcinoma of the bronchus (T1aN3M1c).

Due to the severe adverse event, salvage chemotherapy was initiated. The patient also experienced significant side effects including osteoporosis, severe asthenia, complete anorexia, nausea, epigastric pain, and painful hepatomegaly.

Given the EGFR DEL19 mutation, the patient was subsequently treated with osimertinib, a third-generation anti-EGFR TKI. Following treatment with osimertinib, the patient experienced a tumor morphologic partial response. Monitoring of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) levels showed a decrease in DEL19 mutation ctDNA levels. The patient's case highlights the importance of biomarker analysis, including EGFR (DEL19 and L858R) and JAK3 (EGFR amplification), in guiding treatment decisions for NSCLC, as well as the potential for severe adverse events like thrombotic microangiopathy associated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

Thoracocentesis was performed, and cytology revealed malignant cells, indicating tumor progression involving the pleura. PET-CT showed increased 18F-FDG uptake of the left upper lung mass with a SUVmax of 15.49. The PET-CT scan also indicated intensive 18F-FDG hypermetabolism in the left pleura nodules (SUVmax = 12.03) and left mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes (SUVmax = 9.66). Lung mass biopsy confirmed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with positive staining for CK7 (3+), TTF-1 (3+) and Ki67 (70 %). Tumor cells were negative for programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1). Next-generation sequencing (NGS) showed the presence of KIF5B-RET rearrangement in both lung biopsy tissue and pleural effusion samples. A concurrent genetic aberrance was a missense mutation in TP53. The NGS testing also revealed a tumor mutation burden (TMB) of 1.25 Muts/Mb.

This was on a background of atrial fibrillation with ischaemic stroke for which he was anticoagulated on warfarin. Initial endoscopic assessment identified an oozing gastric ulcer, which was managed with endoscopic adrenaline injection and clipping. He had recurrent melaena a few months after the initial presentation and repeat endoscopy revealed a bleeding duodenal polyp. Six months after this presentation he had further episodes of melaena requiring frequent blood transfusions. Repeat gastroscopy confirmed presence of gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE), which was managed with argon plasma coagulation. Due to disease progression with pulmonary metastasis, Sunitinib was ceased, and second-line therapy with cabozantinib was considered. Unfortunately, the patient’s condition deteriorated due to hospital-acquired pneumonia and fluid overload.

Ten years later while on surveillance, he experienced abdominal pain, and an abdominal ultrasound revealed a pancreatic lesion. Two years later, he presented with upper GI bleeding and melaena. Additionally, his pulmonary metastasis led to tracheal involvement, causing obstructive symptoms. Despite undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy, his disease progressed, prompting a transition to palliative care. He subsequently succumbed to complications arising from tracheal involvement. Two months later, he suffered a fatal upper GI bleeding event.

graph_220,False,"A series of clinical cases highlight the potential for gastrointestinal (GI) metastasis from various primary cancers, leading to a range of symptoms and outcomes. Patients presenting with abdominal pain, weight loss, nausea, and overt bleeding may be experiencing GI metastasis. Weight loss often stems from early satiety, inadequate calorie intake, and heightened catabolism, with nausea and abdominal pain further complicating food intake. GI metastasis can manifest as dysphagia when the oesophagus is involved, alongside symptoms of nausea, vomiting, bloating, and abdominal pain. Endoscopic examination may reveal nodules or ulcers indicative of metastasis.

The following cases illustrate this phenomenon:

The postoperative course was marked by prolonged air leakage, but pleurodesis was not required, and the chest tube was removed on postoperative day 16. The patient then received two additional courses of pemetrexed in combination with cisplatin.

Throughout the postoperative follow-up period, chest CT scans showed persistent RTS in the right chest cavity (Figure 1A). At 6 months after surgery, a chest CT revealed nodules on the surface of the right lung, which gradually increased in size and were diagnosed as a recurrence of mesothelioma.

Ten months post-surgery, the patient started combination therapy with nivolumab and ipilimumab. However, this was discontinued shortly after the first course due to the development of grade 2 pneumonitis. Oral prednisolone (30 mg/day) was administered to treat the pneumonitis, which improved, and the prednisolone dosage was reduced to 5 mg/day.

Twelve months post-surgery, a CT scan showed an enlarged RTS and small fluid retention in the airspace without lung consolidation (Figure 1B). At this time, the patient was asymptomatic and followed up.

Approximately 3 weeks later, the patient developed a cough. A chest X-ray showed an air-fluid level (Figure 1C), suggesting fluid accumulation in the RTS. Thoracic drainage was performed, revealing air leakage and purulent fluid, leading to a diagnosis of fistulous pyothorax. A chest CT identified the responsible bronchus in the right middle lobe (Figure 1D). An attempt was made to perform bronchial embolization with an endobronchial spigot (EWS), but this failed because some spigots penetrated the empyema cavity."

No radiation or chemotherapy was administered at the time of surgery and she had remained cancer free with no reoccurrence based on her yearly pulmonary follow ups. She noticed the mass over the past year and although it was painless, it had raised concern due to its progressive size.

Physical exam revealed a 2-3 cm non-tender mass palpated under the surgical scar, becoming more prominent with scapular movement. Ultrasound showed a 3 cm complex mass. MRI showed a heterogeneously enhancing mass along the right posterior lateral chest wall, increased in size compared to a 2015 chest CT scan performed for lung cancer follow-up.

Differential diagnosis included elastofibroma, desmoid tumor, sarcoma, and recurrent lung cancer.

A CT-guided biopsy was performed.

A patient presented with a complex medical history involving multiple primary malignancies and associated complications. The patient was initially diagnosed with malignant melanoma, followed by non-small cell lung cancer, and subsequently clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). The ccRCC diagnosis was further complicated by the development of osteolytic lesions and metastatic bone lesions, indicative of advanced disease.

The patient's treatment course included sunitinib for the ccRCC, which initially showed some efficacy. However, the patient later developed progressive bone disease and experienced asthenia and hand-foot syndrome, likely related to sunitinib. Antalgic radiation therapy was administered to manage the bone pain associated with the metastatic lesions. Zoledronic acid was also used, presumably to address bone metastases.

Further complicating the clinical picture, the patient was also diagnosed with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), which was treated. However, the patient subsequently developed hypothyroidism and chronic thyroiditis, possibly related to the thyroid cancer treatment. Despite treatment for PTC, the patient experienced thyroid dysfunction and recurrent thyroiditis. Later diagnoses included advanced follicular and anaplastic thyroid cancers, as well as Hashimoto thyroiditis. The patient also presented with metastatic, radioiodine-refractory, differentiated thyroid cancers.

The patient's treatment regimen also included Nivolumab, potentially for either the ccRCC or the melanoma, given its use in both malignancies. The patient's disease status was described at one point as minimally progressive disease, and later as no residual cancer, although the specific context of which cancer this referred to is unclear. Carcinoma cells were identified at some point, further indicating the presence of active malignancy. The patient's overall prognosis was guarded, given the multiplicity of primary cancers and the development of metastatic disease.

Further investigation via bone biopsy confirmed the presence of carcinoma cells compatible with ccRCC in L1 and L2 vertebrae, indicating metastasis. Assessment of the patient's overall condition and disease progression resulted in a prognostic Motzer risk score of intermediate.

Treatment was initiated with antalgic radiation therapy to L1 and L2 for a total dose of 36 Gy, followed by first-line sunitinib 50 mg per day (4-weeks-on/2-weeks-off schedule) and zoledronic acid. Due to Grade 2 asthenia and Grade 2 hand-foot syndrome, the sunitinib schedule was adjusted to 2-weeks-on/1-week-off, with better tolerability.

The patient subsequently developed subclinical hypothyroidism, but L-thyroxine replacement therapy was not initiated. Further investigation of the thyroid via neck ultrasound showed a thyroid gland of normal volume, without nodules or parenchymal abnormalities. The sunitinib dose was then reduced to 37.5 mg per day due to worsening hand-foot syndrome. TSH normalized without therapy after reduction of the sunitinib dose.

Follow-up neck US showed a thyroid micronodule (4 x 4 x 5 mm, vol 0.042 mL) solid in nature, strongly hypoechoic, with taller-than-wide shape, ill-defined margins, and little peripheral vascularity on Doppler US. Spine MRI showed a suspect metastatic bone lesion in C4 vertebra. The patient continued sunitinib 37.5 mg per day due to stability of the bone lesions at periodic CT and MRI scans."

The patient showed sudden neurologic decline, and repeat imaging revealed enlargement of the hematoma with significant brain compression. The patient underwent emergent angiography revealing a distal cortical middle cerebral artery aneurysm, suspicious for mycotic etiology, which was treated through microsurgical excision at the time of hematoma evacuation. The aneurysm specimen was sent for cultures and pathology, revealing the diagnosis of metastatic non-small-cell carcinoma. Further inpatient workup did not reveal the primary neoplastic source.

The patient, with no known cancer history, presented with aneurysmal hemorrhage, initially presumed to be mycotic in etiology due to the lesion’s location and morphology. Intraoperative pathology revealed non-small-cell adenocarcinoma. Imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis did not reveal a culprit lesion, rendering lung adenocarcinoma an unlikely source and leaving breast adenocarcinoma as the leading primary diagnosis among adenocarcinoma of other distant sites.

Head CT revealed a 4.7 x 3.8 x 2.2 cm right parietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage and 1 cm left parietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage. CTA revealed a spot sign with vascular pouch in the region of the right-sided hemorrhage, raising concern for mycotic aneurysm or a dural AV fistula. The patient was neurologically intact upon initial presentation.

The patient suddenly became lethargic with facial asymmetry and left hemiparesis. Repeat head CT revealed enlargement of the right-sided hematoma to 5.8 × 5.5 × 5.0 cm with 1.3 cm brain compression and midline shift. Right parietal hemorrhage and left parietal hemorrhage were noted. Axial CTA revealed the vascular lesion in the hematoma. Axial non-contrast head CT revealed expanding intraparenchymal hemorrhage pattern with mass effect. Angiogram revealed a distal cortical middle cerebral artery (MCA) fusiform aneurysm, raising suspicion for mycotic etiology given the location. The patient underwent stereotactic right parietal minicraniotomy.

Partial intraparenchymal hematoma evacuation was performed. A pseudoaneurysm capsule was identified along the distal posterior parietal MCA branches with two clear superficial outflow vessels. The aneurysm was isolated and excised; the specimen was sent for pathology and cultures. Transesophageal echocardiogram was negative for endocarditis or atrial myxoma. Intraoperative and blood cultures were negative for infectious process.

Head CTs demonstrated small contralateral hemorrhage without evidence of vascular pathology or metastatic disease on cerebral angiography or MRI. Pathology was consistent with metastatic non-small-cell adenocarcinoma within the aneurysmal wall, with immunohistochemistry staining positive for CK7 and negative for CK 5/6, CK 20, TTF-1, and p63. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was obtained and was negative for a malignancy source. Histopathology was reviewed by multiple pathologists, with breast cancer determined as the most likely source of the adenocarcinomatous morphology, especially in the context of negative CT chest/abdomen/ pelvis.

**Case 2:** A 49-year-old male was found to have omental thickening in the pelvis and right lower quadrant, reminiscent of peritoneal “carcinomatosis,” incidentally found during a hernia repair. The patient had a remote history of osteosarcoma more than 3 decades ago that was treated with chemotherapy with complete response. He also had vague nodularity in the peritoneum (bladder, side wall, mesoappendix, bowel, perirectal), with the largest nodule measuring 0.8 cm, incidentally identified during the hernia repair.

graph_225,True,"Mesothelioma is a rare, aggressive malignant neoplasm of mesothelial origin. Inactivation of BRCA1 associated protein 1 (BAP1) is the most common pathogenetic alteration in malignant mesotheliomas. Additionally, genetic alterations in Hippo pathway genes [neurofibromatosis type 2/merlin (NF2), LATS1/2, RASSF1, SAV1], as well as SETD2, SETDB1, DDX3X, DDX51, TP53, CDKN2A, were also reported in a subset of malignant mesotheliomas. A small subset of peritoneal mesothelioma is driven by recurrent gene fusions, mostly EWSR1/FUS::ATF1 fusions, with predilection for young adults. Rare cases of peritoneal mesotheliomas, typically in children or young adults, harboring recurrent gene fusions in ALK and EWSR1/FUS::ATF1 have been reported without associated asbestos exposure. To date, only two cases of mesothelioma harboring EWSR1::YY1 fusions have been described. Moreover, an EWSR1::YY1 fusion was reported in a single case study of 2 patients with peritoneal mesothelioma.

This report presents three additional cases of EWSR1::YY1-fused peritoneal mesotheliomas, two localized and one diffuse, all occurring in the peritoneum of middle-aged adults (2 females and 1 male), and discovered incidentally by imaging or during surgery performed for unrelated reasons. These cases suggest that EWSR1::YY1-fusion defines a small subset of peritoneal epithelioid mesothelioma in middle-aged adults without history of asbestos exposure.

One patient had a remote history of osteosarcoma more than 3 decades ago that was treated with chemotherapy with complete response. Another patient has a history of hemicolectomy for an early-stage colonic adenocarcinoma 5 years ago.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) results were: ALK+, CK+, CK5/6+, TTF-1+, NapsinA+, Ki-67+, P40-, CD56-, Syn-, NUT-.

The patient received first-line treatment with alectinib 600 mg twice a day orally and achieved a partial response. Due to chest pain and aggravated bone destruction of the 8th thoracic vertebra, the patient underwent palliative local radiotherapy targeting the lesion of the 7th to 9th thoracic vertebrae, with a tissue dose of 30 Gy/10 fractions/14 days.

Approximately 4.5 months after radiotherapy, CT scans indicated disease progression with enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes and new metastases in the 10th thoracic vertebra and the right occipital lobe.

Genetic testing revealed an ALK rearrangement, specifically an ALK translocation, with HIP1-ALK fusion and ALK-RNF144A fusion identified. An RB1 loss-of-function variant was also detected.

Initial treatment involved ALK inhibitors, specifically an ALK-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (ALK-TKI). The patient achieved a partial response with alectinib. However, disease progression occurred, with aggravated bone destruction and new metastases. Palliative local radiotherapy was administered to address the bone metastases.

The patient subsequently underwent chemotherapy with pemetrexed and carboplatin, combined with bevacizumab (ALK-TKI combined with anti-angiogenesis). This resulted in stable disease.

Later, the patient experienced further disease progression, including squamous cell carcinoma transformation. Treatment was switched to lorlatinib.

The patient was treated with tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil (S-1), but it was ineffective. Two years after recurrence of lung adenocarcinoma, brain metastasis was found. The patient's performance status (PS) was zero, and she had no neurological symptoms. Gadolinium contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI of the head showed a 4 mm strongly contrasted nodule in the left parietal lobe with surrounding edema. Gamma-knife treatment was started. Chest X-ray showed thickening of the right paratracheal line and protrusion of the right first arch and decreased permeability of the right lower lung field due to pleural effusion. PET-CT revealed a mass near the end of the right lower lobe bronchus with strong 18F-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose accumulation in the same area. Right pleural dissemination, eighth and ninth rib metastasis, and multiple mediastinal lymph node metastasis were observed. The patient received pemetrexed (PEM), resulting in improved clinical symptoms, decreased tumor size, and decreased CA125 levels. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography showed a marked improvement. Initial examination: PET-CT image was taken."

She had been diagnosed with Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) 11 months prior to presentation, during evaluation for seizures. She received six weeks of low-dose radiation with concomitant temozolomide (115mg/day oral daily), which was discontinued due to refractory pancytopenia. Bevacizumab treatment was started. Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody that works as a chimeric VEGF receptor, blocking VEGF and preventing it from binding to VEGFR.

The patient complained of significant abdominal pain the night before presentation. En route to the hospital, she experienced three seizure episodes, which were treated with benzodiazepines in the emergency room. Physical exam revealed abdominal tenderness with distention, rigidity, and guarding, alongside neurological findings. Labs showed low bicarbonate (19 mEq/L, normal range: 23-29 mEq/L) and mild elevation of high sensitivity troponin I (71 pg/mL, normal range: 0-12 pg/mL). A CT scan of the head showed the right frontal and temporal lobe masses with a stable subfalcine shift of 7.0 mm.

CT imaging of the abdomen revealed a large amount of retroperitoneal air, and some intraperitoneal air extending to the mediastinum. Distal colonic perforation with stool material outside of the colon in the pelvis and a sizable pelvic fluid collection was suspected. Colonic perforation was suspected to be at the descending colon/sigmoid colon junction, where the colon appeared somewhat thickened. No evidence of hemorrhage or obstructive hydrocephalus was found. An old CT scan of the abdomen showed a large diverticulum at the site of perforation. A current CT Scan Abdomen and Pelvis without contrast showed air in the peritoneum from Intestinal perforation.

A stat consultation with the surgical team was obtained, and the patient's condition was discussed with the patient's oncologist and husband. Comfort care was initiated per patient's wishes. Surgery was not considered due to the probability of poor wound healing."

Oxygen saturation level in the surrounding air was 94%. Rhythmic heart sounds were present, with a systolic murmur in the aortic area that extended to the carotid arteries and a systolic murmur in the mitral area, irradiating to the axilla.

Vitals were as follows: Blood pressure 140/90 mmHg, heart rate 80 bpm. The abdomen was painless on palpation; intestinal transit and diuresis were normal. The patient was on long-term treatment with bisoprolol, perindopril, indapamide, acetylsalicylic acid, and atorvastatin. Initial biological evaluation did not identify significant pathological changes.

A negative RT-PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 was obtained. ECG showed sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 80 bpm, normal QRS axis, Q waves in the DII, DIII, and aVF derivations, and no alterations in the ventricular repolarization phase. Chest X-ray showed no pleural or pulmonary lesions. Contrast-enhanced CT of the chest revealed a 41/24/30 mm multiseptate lung tumor with multicystic appearance and peripheral gadolinophilia in the lower left lobe, with direct communication to the bronchial lumen, associated with bronchial dilatations and discrete ground-glass areas.

Further CT scan of the chest showed a partially solid spiculiform image (22/18/20 mm) in the left Fowler segment, extending to the parietal pleura and oblique fissure, exerting a retractive effect. No mediastinal adenopathies were identified. The 41/24/30 mm lung tumor was confirmed in the lower left lobe.

Contrast-enhanced chest computed tomography, venous phase showed a multiseptate lung tumor with multicystic appearance, located in the lower left lobe. Lung adenocarcinoma was diagnosed, located at the level of the left Fowler segment. Contrast-enhanced chest computed tomography showed a partially solid spiculiform tumor with maximum dimensions of 22/18/20 mm, located in the left Fowler segment.

After seven months, partial remission of the lung cancer was observed without progression of IPF. Nine months later, HRCT revealed partial remission without exacerbation of IPF. This case indicates the possibility of nintedanib monotherapy in suppressing lung cancer complicated by IPF. We present a case of an elderly patient with non-small cell carcinoma with underlying idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) who was treated with nintedanib. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic progressive lung disease and a risk factor for lung cancer development. However, it remains unclear whether nintedanib is an effective treatment for lung cancer in patients with IPF. Patients with lung cancer complicated by IPF in whom treatment is effective remain unknown. Additional research is needed to identify effective therapy for lung cancer with IPF.

He had a history of smoking one pack per day for more than 30 years but quit in 2018. He was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and left upper lobe squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (Pancoast tumor), stage cT4N1M0. Whole-body computed tomography (CT) showed tumor size >7 cm.

In June 2019, concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) was initiated with radiation at a dose of 60 Gy in 30 fractions with oral vinorelbine and cisplatin for stage IIIA (cT4, ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes) left upper lobe squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).

In February 2020, a follow-up CT image showed regression of the left upper lobe tumor.

In May 2020, the patient presented to the orthopedic outpatient department with a 10-day history of a rapidly progressing painful swelling on his right wrist. Systemic examination revealed a tender soft tissue swelling with increased local temperature located in the wrist of his right hand. The swelling was firm in consistency, oval-shaped, and 7 × 5 cm in size. The right wrist swelling was characterized by reddened skin, warmth, edema, and no discharging sinus. Pronation and supination were restricted. A forearm radiograph showed an oval osteolytic lesion with a cortical moth-eaten appearance over the distal ulnar area. MRI showed an osteolytic tumor in the distal ulnar shaft measuring 5.3 × 3.2 × 2.8 cm with a prominent heterogeneous extraosseous component at the central aspect. Angiography showed that the tumor in the right wrist was supplied mainly by the right anterior and posterior interosseous arteries and small ulnar artery branches. A whole-body 99m Tc-phosphate bone scan showed newly observed and isolated focally increased tracer uptake in the right distal ulna. A previous 99m Tc-phosphate bone scan from November 2019 showed minimal tracer uptake in the left ninth rib thought to be a post-traumatic change because of its pre-existing visibility. Bone and soft tissue tumor biopsies of the right wrist lesion were performed. Tissue sections showed that the bone and bone marrow were infiltrated by nests of poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells. The tumor cell nests displayed abundant neutrophil infiltration. The right wrist lesion pathology revealed poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells with abundant neutrophil infiltration and extremely focal keratinization.

In September 2020, the patient underwent continuous CCRT and was followed up at the outpatient department with no signs of progression.

Pulmonary function testing revealed a forced expiratory volume in 1 second that was 23.5% of the predicted value, indicating GOLD stage 4 COPD.

The patient was started on concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) consisting of 7 cycles of chemotherapy with weekly carboplatin (AUC = 2) and paclitaxel.

Eighteen days after the start of CRT, the patient developed grade 3 esophagitis symptoms and was treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and sodium alginate. He also experienced constipation secondary to chemotherapy, which was managed with magnesium oxide and sennoside.

On the 32nd day of CRT, the patient developed febrile neutropenia and was administered tazobactam/piperacillin (4.5 g intravenously every 8 h) and filgrastim (75 \u03bcg/day subcutaneously).

The patient was experiencing respiratory distress, characterized by tachypnea (40 breaths per minute), sinus tachycardia at 144 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation as low as 79 % despite 100 % Fi02 via a non-rebreather mask. Physical examination revealed dried blood in the bilateral nares and oral cavity, increased work of breathing, severe subcostal and intercostal retractions, and diminished breath sounds throughout both lung bases. His hemoglobin level was 10.9 g/dl.

Laboratory findings included a normal platelet count and an INR of 1. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed respiratory acidosis: pH 7.27, pCO2 54, pO2 94, bicarbonate 25. The patient was trialed on continuous positive pressure noninvasive ventilation but was unable to tolerate the mask due to anxiety. He coughed an additional 40-60 cc of bright red blood.

Due to worsening respiratory status, the patient was intubated with a standard 8.0 endotracheal tube. Oxygen saturations initially improved to 97 % on 100 % FiO2, but quickly decreased to 30 %. Frank blood was visible from the endotracheal tube.

Emergent bronchoscopy revealed blood originating from the left lung. The posterior wall of the distal left mainstem bronchus was necrotic with evidence of a cavitary lesion in the superior segment of the left lower lobe extending into the lung parenchyma, through which a large vessel could be seen.

graph_241,True,"**Introduction:** Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is encountered in about 8–15% of lung cancer patients at initial cancer diagnosis. The optimal therapeutic strategies for lung cancer with MPE remain unclear. Malignant pleural effusion is commonly encountered in about 8–15% of lung cancer patients at the time of initial cancer diagnosis, which has been categorized as stage IVa disease. The prognosis of lung cancer patients with MPE remains dismal with a median overall survival time of 5 months and a 5-year survival rate of 3%. Current guidelines recommended non-surgical therapy including local therapy (for example ambulatory small catheter drainage, pleurodesis, and pericardial window) with similar treatment strategies to other stage IV diseases consisting of systemic therapy and palliative therapy.

**Case Description:** This study reports a case of lung cancer with MPE, which was successfully managed with a multidisciplinary therapeutic strategy. The patient initially received gefitinib for 4 months with excellent response and underwent salvage thoracoscopic lobectomy and systematic lymphadenectomy. Pathological complete response was confirmed, and gefitinib was discontinued. The patient received 4 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy instead. The patient is still alive without disease progression for 62 months after surgery.

**Conclusions:** Combining targeted therapy, salvage surgery, and adjuvant therapy may be a promising treatment strategy for lung cancer with MPE harboring oncogene-targeted mutations.

Immunohistochemistry results were: PCK(+), CK7 (focally +), TTF-1(+), CK18(+), CK5/6(-), P63(scattered +), CK14(-), CDX-2(-), CD56(+), CgA(-), Sgn(-), Ki-67(~50%). Percutaneous needle biopsy confirmed an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutation (exon 21 L858R). The patient was then prescribed gefitinib (250 mg, QD). After 4 months of gefitinib treatment, a chest computed tomography scan showed excellent radiographic response. In August 2016, the patient received lobectomy and systematic lymph node dissection under video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). Intraoperative findings revealed no pleural involvement, confirmed by pleural biopsy. The patient was discharged uneventfully on postoperative day 5. Postoperative pathology showed no residual tumor in the right upper lobe nor in the mediastinal lymph node, confirming pathological complete response to gefitinib (ypT0N0M0). Numerous chronic inflammatory cells, foamy histiocytes, and dense fibrosis were observed with no viable tumor seen. Immunohistochemistry results were: PCK(-), EMA(-), CK7(-), TTF-1(-), NapsinA(-), CK5/6(-), P63(-), PGM-1 (inflammatory cells+). The patient discontinued gefitinib and underwent four cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy (cisplatinum 40 mg on days 1-3 and pemetrexed 800 mg on day 1). In December 2016, the patient finished the last course of adjuvant chemotherapy with only grade 2 leukopenia and no grade 3-4 drug-related adverse events.

graph_242,True,"A patient with resectable non-small cell lung cancer, specifically squamous cell lung carcinoma, received neoadjuvant therapy consisting of nivolumab and chemotherapy followed by surgery. The neoadjuvant chemotherapy and nivolumab aimed to reduce residual disease. Preoperative tumour response was assessed using RECIST criteria, with some patients achieving partial response (PR). Metabolic responses were also evaluated using 18F‐fluorodeoxyglucose‐positron emission tomography (FDG‐PET). The study investigated whether metabolic response on FDG-PET could be a predictor of pathological complete response (pCR) and longer event‐free survival (EFS). In resected tumours, pCR was correlated with improved event-free survival. The study suggests that metabolic response assessed by FDG-PET during neoadjuvant treatment may predict tumour response and pCR, ultimately influencing event-free survival.

The majority (96.6%) had undergone resection, and 69% had received both radiation therapy and temozolomide. Bevacizumab was used in 34.5% of patients, and 6.9% had received Tumor Treating Fields (Optune). Obesity was present in 27.6% of patients, and 20.7% had a history of tobacco use.

The primary cancer types in the cohort were Astrocytoma (62.1%), Oligodendroglioma (24.1%), and Mesiotemporal angiocentric glioma (6.9%). One patient contracted COVID-19 twice. The median delay between glioma diagnosis and COVID-19 diagnosis was 59 months. At the time of COVID-19 diagnosis, 27.6% were taking dexamethasone, and 27.6% were undergoing cancer-specific treatment (2 on clinical trials, 2 receiving temozolomide, 2 on bevacizumab, 1 getting radiation therapy, and 1 undergoing resection).

Chest X-ray on admission showed bilateral giant bullous emphysema, mediastinal shift to the right, and a mass in the right hilum. Oxygen saturation was 96% while breathing 5 L/min oxygen with a face mask. Further evaluation revealed a body temperature of 38.0°C, blood pressure of 102/75 mmHg, heart rate of 110 beats/min, and respiratory rate of 33 breaths/min. Auscultation revealed decreased breath sounds bilaterally. Chest x-ray showed compression of the left lower lobe and heart to the right, and displacement of the anterior junction line to the right, indicating rapid enlargement of the left bulla. CT revealed a monocystic left-sided bulla compressing the lower lobe, and severe destruction of the right upper lobe forming GBE with multiple septations. Three separate nodules were found in the right upper, right lower, and left lower lobes.

Pro-gastrin-releasing peptide level was 325 pg/mL (normal range <80.9 pg/mL) and carcinoembryonic antigen level was 5.3 ng/mL (normal range <5.0 ng/mL). Serum alpha-1-antitrypsin level was normal (225 mg/dL). He was treated with remdesivir and nasal high-flow oxygen therapy (FiO2= 40%).

Intracavitary drainage was performed to relieve the tension in the left bulla. Under CT guidance, a cannula was inserted into the left bulla and 2000 mL of air was drained. A chest tube was placed in the left thoracic cavity to avoid tension pneumothorax. Respiratory status improved rapidly after drainage.

Post-drainage, the left lower lobe expanded with mild pneumothorax. Slight air leak was observed from the chest tube, maintaining pressure in the bulla and thoracic cavity close to atmospheric pressure. The mMRC scale score improved to 3 while breathing 1 L/min oxygen by day 14 post-procedure.

Antimicrobial therapy was ineffective, leading to hospital admission. On admission, her vital signs and breath sounds were normal. Chest CT revealed consolidation outside the radiation field in the upper, middle, and lower lobes. Bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) analysis showed no malignant findings, but lymphocytes were increased, and the CD4/8 ratio was decreased. A diagnosis of radiation therapy-induced organizing pneumonia was made. Due to severe respiratory discomfort on exertion, she was treated with methylprednisolone (500 mg for 3 days) followed by oral prednisolone (20 mg/day), which was tapered at an outpatient clinic. Eight months after initiating steroid treatment, chest radiography showed resolution of the shadows, and steroid administration was discontinued. However, one month later, new consolidation appeared in the left lung, indicating relapsing organizing pneumonia. Symptomatic treatment was initiated (as hypoxemia was absent), and the shadow completely disappeared within three months.

NSCLC is a common form of lung cancer and a leading cause of death worldwide. The patient's disease progressed on 4 cycles of alimta, carboplatin, and keytruda, and was PD-1 (+) 25%. The case suggests that a treatment regimen involving a combination of autologous immunotherapy and bevacizumab may be a potential approach for advanced NSCLC with PD-L1 expression. Bevacizumab is approved for the treatment of several cancers, including metastatic non-squamous NSCLC, and is often combined with chemotherapy as a first-line and maintenance treatment in advanced NSCLC. Studies have also explored bevacizumab in association with new molecular therapies or immunotherapy for maintenance treatment or disease progression. Studies have shown that the combination of bevacizumab and chemotherapy increased overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) more than the group receiving chemotherapy alone in NSCLC patients. Moreover, a combination of bevacizumab and atezolizumab was indicated to have a promising antitumor activity with good tolerability for patients with metastatic NSCLC whose disease had progressed after atezolizumab monotherapy. Studies have also explored advanced NSCLC patients with PD-L1 (+) given pembrolizumab.

graph_254,True,"A 53-year-old man, a resident of a Mediterranean coast area (south of France), was admitted with a history of fever, fatigue, no weight loss, and prolonged pancytopenia. The pancytopenia began three weeks after a first cycle of maintenance chemotherapy with pemetrexed (500 mg/m2). Prior to this, he had received 4 cycles of chemotherapy combining cis-platinum and pemetrexed for non-progressive advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. Maintenance chemotherapy is a standard treatment in patients with this condition after induction therapy.

Despite filgrastim injections, the pancytopenia persisted. A bone marrow aspiration revealed a macrophage activation syndrome with Leishmania amastigotes. A Polymerase Chain Reaction test confirmed the diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis (kala azar). The prolonged pancytopenia, initially presumed to be drug-induced, was in fact related to the visceral leishmaniasis. Treatment with liposomal amphotericin B was started.

While pemetrexed has a low incidence for bone marrow toxicity, pancytopenia can occur, leading to delays in further cycles. Nevertheless, other causes of anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia can be found in immunocompromised patients.

This occurred three weeks after his first cycle of maintenance chemotherapy with pemetrexed (500 mg/m2), following four cycles of chemotherapy combining cis-platinum and pemetrexed. He had no significant past medical history, no blood transfusions, and no recent travel abroad. His ECOG performance status was 1, Body Mass Index (BMI) was 27, and Body Surface Area (BSA) was 2.

Physical examination revealed pallor and moderate splenomegaly, but no peripheral lymphadenopathy or skin lesions. Laboratory studies, conducted after filgrastim injections (5 µg/kg daily for 10 days), showed a white-cell count of 1600/mm3, neutrophile count of 570/mm3, eosinophil count of 0/mm3, platelet count of 70,000/mm3, hemoglobin level of 7.7 g/dL, MCV 83 fl, MCH 26.1 pg, and a C reactive protein (CRP) test result of 105.3 mg/L.

Further investigations revealed normal renal and liver function tests, blood glucose, electrolytes, serum ferritin, and iron levels. Plasma levels for vitamin B12 and folate were also normal, at 253 pmole/L and 27.1 nmole/L, respectively. Blood cultures and tests for SARS-CoV-2 and HIV were negative, and cytomegalovirus infection was ruled out. Bone marrow aspiration cytology revealed normal trilineage hematopoiesis, but Leishmania amastigotes were observed both outside and within the cytoplasm of a macrophage.

Based on these findings, a diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis was confirmed by PCR testing on stained slides with May-Grunwald Giemsa (MGG). Consequently, maintenance chemotherapy was suspended."
graph_255,True,"A 48-year-old male patient with a 14 pack-year smoking history, and no other significant medical history, was admitted with a primary complaint of cough and back pain. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a 77 mm mass in the lower lobe of the right lung with left atrial invasion, enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes (#2R, 4R, #7, and #2L), right hilar lymph nodes, and right pleural effusion. Transbronchial lung biopsy histopathological immunohistochemistry (IHC) revealed TTF-1 positive adenocarcinoma. Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma, cT4N3M1a, stage IVA.

IHC analysis indicated that the tumor cells were positive for ALK antibody (clone D5F3, VENTANA). Molecular analysis revealed an *EML4-ALK* fusion V1 (E13:A20). PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx assay showed high PD-L1 expression with a tumor proportion score (TPS) of 100%. Analysis also revealed that the case was MSI-high, with immunohistochemistry showing the nuclei of the tumor cells were positive for MLH1 and PMS2 but negative for MSH2 and MSH6, indicating MSI status with MSH2 gene disruption.

The patient was initially treated with alectinib at 300 mg twice a day. Two months after starting alectinib, the tumor size decreased. However, five months after alectinib treatment, the patient experienced pain in the left fingertips and was diagnosed with peripheral arterial occlusive disease. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed multiple cerebral infarctions, and laboratory tests demonstrated elevated D-dimer (21.6 μg/ml) levels. CT scan showed left atrial invasion progression. The patient was started on Heparin therapy for cancer-associated thromboembolism. Alectinib was discontinued, and the patient was switched to pembrolizumab IV therapy at 200 mg every three weeks.

Two months after initiating pembrolizumab therapy, the left atrial invasion significantly decreased, and D-dimer levels returned to normal. The patient continued pembrolizumab therapy for a year with no adverse events, and continued tumor shrinkage. Heparin was switched to Apixaban.

graph_256,True,"A 61-year-old asymptomatic male smoker presented for low-dose lung CT lung cancer screening at the referral of his primary care physician. The initial study identified a suspicious 1.6 cm spiculated apical right upper lobe nodule and a small right lower lobe consolidation felt to represent infection and inflammation. A Lung-RADS category 4X was assigned due to the high-risk apical nodule. PET/CT and pulmonary consultation were recommended in the original report.

PET/CT was notable for increased FDG uptake in the basilar consolidation. Transthoracic needle biopsy of both lesions was performed. Pathologic diagnoses revealed a pulmonary amyloid nodule for the apical nodule and pulmonary extramarginal zone lymphoma of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT lymphoma) for the basilar consolidation.

Low-dose CT is a widely accepted method of screening for lung cancer in high-risk patients. While incidental findings commonly occur in this setting, the large number of patients screened also increases the probability of rare diagnoses and rare combinations of diagnoses. In this case, a combination of a rare benign diagnosis (pulmonary amyloid nodule) and an uncommon incidental malignant diagnosis (pulmonary MALT lymphoma) were made in the same patient. This case underscores the value of pathologic diagnosis in cases of indeterminate lung nodules.

The initial study identified a suspicious 1.6 cm spiculated apical right upper lobe nodule and a small right lower lobe consolidation felt to represent infection and inflammation. Lung-RADS category 4X was assigned due to the high-risk apical nodule. PET/CT and pulmonary consultation were recommended.

Follow-up CT chest with contrast showed an apical nodule and a 1-2 cm right lower lobe consolidation. PET/CT demonstrated increased FDG uptake in the basilar consolidation but not in the apical nodule. No other significant abnormality was noted on whole-body PET/CT.

Thoracic surgery consultation was initiated due to indeterminate radiographic features of the right upper lobe nodule. The basilar consolidation also displayed indeterminate radiologic and metabolic characteristics, suggestive of infectious, inflammatory, or neoplastic etiology. Contrast-enhanced CT chest demonstrated a spiculated nodule in the peripheral right upper lobe suspicious for primary lung malignancy.

Further imaging with contrast-enhanced CT chest demonstrated a right upper lobe nodule and a right lower lobe consolidation abutting the major fissure. FDG PET/CT demonstrated increased FDG uptake in the right lower lobe consolidation, but not in the right upper lobe nodule. The radiographic and metabolic appearance was nonspecific to infectious, inflammatory, or neoplastic lesions.

The thoracic surgical consultant recommended tissue sampling of both the nodule and the consolidation. CT-guided core needle biopsy was successfully performed for both lesions. Non-contrast CT performed during biopsy demonstrated the needle tip in the right lower lobe consolidation and a developing pneumothorax. The procedure was complicated by pneumothorax. The patient was immediately decompressed with a pleural catheter and had a rapid recovery, being discharged the next day.

Biopsy of the apical nodule contained amyloid with a moderately cellular lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate. Amyloid was confirmed as congophilic material demonstrating classic apple-green birefringence on polarized microscopy.

Pathology from the basilar nodule biopsy revealed dense lymphoid tissue with characteristics of lymphoma. Immunostaining was positive for CD20 and BCL-2, but negative for CD5, CD10, and CD42, suggesting an extranodal marginal zone lymphoma, also known as a lymphoma of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT).

Pathologic diagnosis of the apical nodule was benign amyloid nodule or amyloidoma. Congo Red Stain, polarized microscopy under 20x magnification demonstrated congophilic material with apple-green birefringence consistent with amyloid.

The patient was referred to medical and radiation oncology for extranodal marginal zone lymphoma. PET/CT showed local disease. The patient was offered definitive treatment with radiotherapy alone.

Histopathology: Standard H&E stain under 40x magnification demonstrated dense lymphocytic infiltrate. Immunostaining demonstrated significantly more cells positive for kappa light chain than lambda light chain suggesting a clonal lymphocyte population consistent with lymphoma.

The patient underwent radiotherapy with a total dose of 36 Gray delivered in 10 fractions for pulmonary MALT lymphoma presenting as right lower lobe consolidation. Radiotherapy was well tolerated, and follow-up CT was performed 8 weeks post-treatment."

Blood sample analysis revealed a smoldering increase of transaminases and a C-reactive protein level of 22 mg/L. These abnormal blood test results prompted abdominal ultrasonography, which revealed a polycystic lesion of 9 cm in diameter in the right flank. A subsequent contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen revealed a polylobate hypodense formation, with multiple thin internal septa which are enriched after contrast (dimension 83 × 43 × 61 mm). Based on these imaging findings, a differential diagnosis was formulated, including peritoneal lymphangiomatosis, enteric duplication cyst, and benign multicystic peritoneal mesothelioma. To confirm the diagnosis, an exploratory laparoscopy was performed, confirming the presence of multiple cystic lesions of the peritoneum, some involving the omentum, with a weak adherence to the ascending colon. Complete excision of the neoformation, with a free margin on omental fat, was performed. A small lesion of the colonic serosa was treated with a prophylactic continuous suture with Vycril 2-0. The excised tissue was sent for pathology to confirm the diagnosis. Gross examination revealed a soft, yellowish tissue specimen measuring 13 × 9 × 4 cm, composed of multiple cysts, up to 1 cm in diameter, containing a clear fluid. Histological examination was also performed. Pathology confirmed the presence of Benign Multicystic Peritoneal Mesothelioma (BMPM).

"
graph_265,True,"A case report describes a patient with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who developed peripheral neurotoxicity as a result of treatment with albumin-bound paclitaxel. Albumin-bound paclitaxel is frequently used in various cancer treatments, including NSCLC, due to its strong targeting capability and low toxicity. However, peripheral neuropathy is a common adverse event induced by paclitaxel, potentially requiring drug modification or discontinuation. Symptoms of peripheral neuropathy depend on the types of neurons (sensory, motor, or autonomic neurons) affected. The mechanism of neuronal injury may be due to altered microtubule dynamics, mitochondrial malfunction, and inflammation of peripheral neurons. The patient's symptoms of peripheral neurotoxicity induced by albumin-bound paclitaxel were alleviated by a regimen containing liposomal paclitaxel, cisplatin, and tislelizumab. This suggests that this regimen may be a potential therapeutic option for managing peripheral neurotoxicity induced by albumin-bound paclitaxel in NSCLC patients.

The tumor measured 8.0 x 7.0 x 7.0 cm and was classified as clinical stage 3, clear cell type histology, grade 2. Histologically, the tumor was solid, with hemorrhage, necrosis, scarring, and pseudocapsule formation, and infiltrated into the renal parenchyma. The tumor spread to the right renal vein, but no infiltration into the inferior vena cava was observed. The patient also had localized right pleural metastases.

Post-nephrectomy, the patient did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy and was asymptomatic, undergoing regular follow-up CT scans of the chest and abdomen every three months.

In March 2020, the patient presented with right chest pain and dyspnea. A CT scan revealed right pleural effusion and multiple pleural masses. No abnormal radiologic findings were noted in other organs. Two pleural effusion tests were performed before surgery, both with cytological results of class I (negative for malignant cells).

One month after the initial presentation, a follow-up CT confirmed that the tumors had grown, despite no new abnormal radiologic findings elsewhere.

Thoracoscopy revealed multiple reddish, soft, bleeding encapsulated tumors in the intrathoracic region. Intrathoracic tumor resection was performed under general anesthesia. Histological diagnosis confirmed pleural metastasis from clear cell type RCC. Pleural fluid cytology showed no malignant cells. Eight bleeding tumors were completely resected, with the largest measuring 5.0 x 3.8 x 2.2 cm.

graph_267,True,"A 59-year-old male with a history of lung cancer with metastasis to the C3 lamina, who was previously independent in activities of daily living, presented to the emergency department with progressive quadriparesis and urinary dysfunction after farming work. An acute cervical epidural hematoma was initially diagnosed, and emergency surgery was subsequently performed. The spinal cord compression from this fluid collection was believed to be the cause of myelopathy, and the metastatic C3 lamina was completely removed to prevent recurrence. The case highlights that various conditions can cause myelopathy due to cervical epidural fluid collection, including idiopathic cervical epidural hematoma, traumatic cervical epidural hematoma, infectious myelitis, epidural abscess, spinal cord infarction, post-traumatic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage, and epidural tumors. This case specifically involved myelopathy caused by rapid accumulation of epidural exudate from a metastatic tumor in the cervical lamina.

Two years prior to presentation, cervical spine metastasis was detected. The patient underwent radiation therapy (20Gy/5Fr) for the cervical metastasis.

Three days before presentation, the patient experienced sudden neck pain during farming work, followed by progressive quadriparesis and urinary dysfunction. On presentation to the emergency department, he could walk with assistance, but his symptoms worsened during examination. He developed quadriparesis (manual muscle testing (MMT) grading: 1/5), bilateral hand sensory disturbance, and urinary retention.

Emergency MRI revealed cervical epidural fluid collection with spinal cord compression. A cervical MRI taken two months prior to presentation showed no evident epidural fluid collection. Acute cervical epidural hematoma was suspected, and emergency surgery was performed, including drainage and partial C3 laminectomy, complete C4,5 laminectomy, and partial C6 laminectomy for decompression. Intraoperative findings showed no clear hematoma but light yellow serous exudate in the epidural space. The intradural space was examined but appeared normal without hematoma."

graph_269,True,"A 57-year-old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) experienced no response to two lines of systemic chemotherapy. He was subsequently treated with nivolumab as third-line therapy, which resulted in a partial response. After 17 months of nivolumab treatment, he developed bone metastasis in his left femur, which was treated with radiation therapy. Nivolumab was restarted after radiation therapy. Four months after radiation therapy, he developed another metastatic lesion in the small intestine, which was surgically resected. Because there were no recurrent NSCLC lesions after surgical resection, nivolumab was restarted again. At 18 months after surgery, there were no recurrent NSCLC lesions. Immunohistochemical analysis of peritumoral T lymphocytes showed higher expression of T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing protein 3 (TIM-3) and lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG-3) in recurrent lesions of bone and small intestine than in primary lesions. Upregulation of TIM-3 and LAG-3 could be associated with mechanisms of adaptive resistance to nivolumab in this case. This case reports a successful instance of continued nivolumab therapy with remission after local treatments consisting of radiation therapy and surgical resection for oligometastases.

However, it is not clear whether previous infection from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may lead to increased morbidity and mortality for subsequent procedures once radiologic resolution is achieved. This case report describes a young patient with lung cancer who successfully underwent a right upper lobectomy for primary adenocarcinoma by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery with no complication in the early postoperative phase.

A 46-year-old man with a 40 pack-year smoking history presented to the emergency department with worsening dyspnea and fever. A chest roentgenogram showed diffuse bilateral opacities with peripheral distribution. A computed tomographic (CT) chest scan revealed peripheral bilateral ground-glass opacity (GGO) with crazy paving appearance plus a 40-mm nodule in the right upper lobe. A nasal swab tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and the diagnosis of COVID-19 was made.

The patient's condition was generally good, and intensive care was not required. He was discharged after 5 days. A repeated nasal swab at 16 days was negative. A positron emission tomography/CT after 30 days showed a standardized uptake value (SUV) of 9 for the nodule, with slight inflammatory uptake of hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes. Improvement of lung opacities was noted.

A CT-guided biopsy was offered, but the patient refused and preferred up-front operation. His medical history was positive for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Pulmonary function was within normal ranges, with forced expiratory volume in 1 second of 3.99 liters (102% of predicted value) and forced vital capacity of 4.98 liters (103%). Diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (Dlco) was preserved (99%).

Upon arrival for surgery, a repeat chest CT scan showed reduction of GGO, and a nasal swab was negative for SARS-CoV-2.

A standard right upper lobectomy with lymphadenectomy was performed with video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery after 45 days from the initial COVID-19 diagnosis. During the surgical procedure, adhesions between the lung and mediastinal structure were noted. The surgeon experienced some difficulty, describing tissues around the hilum as very firm and tough when cutting, with extremely enlarged lymph nodes. Operative time was 215 minutes with no blood loss. There were no complications in the postoperative period, and the patient was discharged after 3 days.

For comparison, length of stay and time to completion of the right upper lobectomy from the same surgeon were analyzed. No difference was present for length of stay, but time to completion was longer (152.5 vs 215 minutes). A 4.3-cm gray lesion was found in the specimen, and histopathologic diagnosis of pT2b N0 adenocarcinoma was made (14 lymph nodes all negative). No alteration was found in the rest of examined lung.

He additionally described a 13 kg weight loss over the past year. The patient presented with intestinal obstruction symptoms for which he underwent an emergency resection of the ileocecal MiNEN. An initial CT scan showed an additional lung mass later identified as an SQ-NSCLC after bronchoscopy biopsy analysis. Given the rapid hepatic metastatic progression, palliative platinum-based chemotherapy was initiated, with an adequate response of the local and metastatic lesions of the MiNEN, but suggested platinum resistance and progression of the pulmonary neoplasm. Second-line treatment with pembrolizumab directed for the SQ-NSCLC was initiated; however, it was stopped after immune-mediated toxicities developed.

Physical examination revealed hypophonesis in the left upper pulmonary quadrant and acropachy in the upper extremities. Complete blood count and serum chemistry showed no abnormalities. A chest X-ray showed a paramediastinal mass in the left upper lobe with homogeneous density and regular edges. The patient was admitted for further evaluation.

During his admission, the patient's abdominal pain worsened, accompanied by bloating, vomiting, GI transit disturbances progressing to complete GI transit stoppage, and significant abdominal distention. Physical examination showed a distended, hyperresonant abdomen, without rebound tenderness or peritoneal irritation signs. A nasogastric tube was placed.

Fourteen days after the first dose of chemotherapy, the patient presented with an impaired consciousness (Glasgow Coma Scale: E4V3M6) and a body temperature of 38.2°C. A physical neurological examination revealed no significant findings, except for motor aphasia. Therefore, the patient was diagnosed with encephalitis, possibly induced by nivolumab and ipilimumab, and treated with 1,000 mg of methylprednisolone for three days. After this intervention, the manifestations associated with meningoencephalitis did not recur. Meningoencephalitis was histologically confirmed during the autopsy, and mild inflammation with a mixture of macrophages and neutrophils was observed at several locations in the meninges. CD8<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes infiltrated the blood vessels in the brain. Metastasis was observed in all organs, except for the ovaries. Autopsy-confirmed encephalitis and CD8<sup>+</sup> lymphocyte infiltration around the blood vessels suggest that the pathogenesis in this case was consistent with encephalitis due to the irAEs of nivolumab and ipilimumab. Early detection and intervention led to a rapid improvement and the disappearance of the symptoms.

graph_274,True,"Background: Immune-related adverse events (irAEs) are secondary reactions related to treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). There have been six cases published reporting on an association between patients undergoing treatment with ICIs and the occurrence of acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP).

Case report: We report a 61-year-old male receiving treatment with chemoimmunotherapy followed by pembrolizumab maintenance therapy for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer, presenting with bleeding symptoms, anemia, and thrombocytopenia.

The patient was then put on maintenance therapy with pembrolizumab 200 mg every three weeks, but only completed two cycles due to the development of anorexia, unexplained weight loss of 10 lbs, and diminishing function in activities of daily living. After an extended discussion on his goals of care, the patient elected to discontinue immunotherapy and manage with surveillance imaging. However, he was subsequently found to have a T6-7 growing mass on MRI that was managed with five fractions of SBRT.

Laboratory testing demonstrated hemolytic anemia, which, in combination with other findings, suggested thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). PLASMIC scoring and specialized testing with ADAMTS13 activity and inhibitor confirmed a diagnosis of TTP.

Our patient experienced an adverse reaction marked by thrombocytopenia and hematuria after drug exposure. With symptom improvement after ICI discontinuation and recurrence on readministration, a presumptive diagnosis of ICI-associated TTP was made. This case report and literature review emphasize the need for close observation of patients undergoing ICI therapy for potential rare irAEs. The further investigation aimed at the study of risk factors, disease severity, and treatment response to this form of secondary TTP is needed to guide treatment decisions.

However, the dog's condition started declining 197 days post-diagnosis, and he died on day 280. A necropsy revealed the AT was a pheochromocytoma, not an adrenocortical tumor. Because of no pathological change in the pituitary gland and the other adrenal gland, the malignant pheochromocytoma was presumed to be the cause of ectopic Cushing’s syndrome (ECS). In humans, ectopic Cushing’s syndrome (ECS) is characterized by hypercortisolemia, which is caused by small lung carcinoma, bronchial carcinoids, and pheochromocytoma.

graph_277,True,"A 62-year-old female with lung adenocarcinoma, post-treatment with ipilimumab and nivolumab, developed life-threatening grade 4 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) two weeks after her last immunotherapy session. Advances in immunotherapy, particularly checkpoint inhibitors (CPI), have improved outcomes in various cancers, but also increased the incidence of immune-related adverse events such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS). CRS is a hyperactivation of the immune system commonly seen in CAR-T cell therapy but can also occur with PD-1 and CTLA-4 inhibitors. Severe forms are characterized by fulminant systemic inflammation, often requiring intensive care and multifaceted treatment.

On 19 October 2023 at 12:50 (14 days after the last ipilimumab plus nivolumab application) she presented in an infectious disease emergency department with symptoms of malaise, fatigue, nausea, vomiting and fever. She denied pain, dyspnea, urinary and gastrointestinal abnormalities. She informed that she had symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection with nasal congestion and a sore throat one week prior, which had completely resolved. Clinical examinations showed hypotension.

She presented with symptoms mimicking septic shock (malaise, fever and hypotension), leading to an initial misdiagnosis of sepsis. Initial treatment of presumed septic shock of unknown origin did not yield results. She was treated with fluids, antibiotics and corticosteroids.

The clinical deterioration, high IL-6 levels and lack of infectious source led to the diagnosis of grade 4 CRS. Elevated IL-6 (10,8878 pg/ml) was a critical diagnostic marker. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is immune dysregulation phenomenon that is associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. It is still difficult to distinguish CRS from other dangerous, acute and life-threatening medical disorders.

The case highlights the importance of considering CRS in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, especially when presenting with severe symptoms. Elevated IL-6 is a key biomarker for CRS, and distinguishing CRS from sepsis is critical for appropriate treatment. For patients on immune checkpoint inhibitors presenting with acute severe illness, comprehensive testing including IL-6 is recommended. Hemadsorption therapy may be a viable rescue option in severe cases of CRS.

graph_279,False,"A 69-year-old male with a history of asbestos exposure and a family history of cancer presented to the hospital in October 2018. He reported swollen lymph nodes in the right inguinal region for 7 months and dyssynergic defecation for 1 month. A CT scan revealed multiple cystic low-density shadows in the right renal parenchyma without obvious enhancement, multiple nodules in the abdominal cavity, and a normal left kidney shape.

Further investigation with a pelvic CT scan revealed a large tumor in the pelvic cavity with inhomogeneous enhancement. Intraoperative findings showed widespread tumor involvement: tumor nodules scattered on the surface of the small intestinal mesentery (maximum diameter of 3.5 cm), tumor nodules distributed on the surface of the ligamentum teres and greater omentum (maximum diameter of 2 cm), patchy tumor nodules scattered in bilateral subphrenic peritoneum (largest size of 6 x 6 x 0.8 cm), and tumor nodules present in the para-colonic sulcus bilaterally (3 cm on the left, 2 cm on the right). The peritoneum of the left lower abdominal wall adhered to the sigmoid colon, harboring scattered small tumor nodules with invasion to the rectum and mesorectum. The small intestine, mesentery, ileocecal and pelvic masses formed a dense adhesion at 400 cm from the flexor ligament. The Peritoneal Cancer Index (PCI) score was 24.

The patient underwent cytoreduction, resulting in minimal residual disease. Gross examination revealed a huge (18 x 15 x 11 cm) tumor located in the pelvic cavity. The tumor section was grayish yellow, solid, and of medium texture. Two masses located in the omentum measured 2 x 2 x 0.3 cm and 1 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm. The section was grayish red and soft. Histopathological analysis showed that most tumor cells were arranged in sheet-like structures without papillary patterns. Some tumor cells were arranged in tubular structures. The tumor cells had clear cytoplasm, were large and round to polygonal, displayed abundant clear cytoplasm with an evident cytoplasmic membrane and eccentric small round nuclei. Mitotic figures were rare.

Immunohistochemical staining was performed. Tumor cells exhibited diffuse strong staining for cytokeratins (CKs), Vimentin, D2–40, Wilms’ tumor 1 (WT-1) and INI-1. Tumor cells were focally positive for calretinin. The following results were also obtained: CK+, EMA+, CK7+, CAM5.2-, CK20-, CK8/18-, CK5/6-, Vimentin+, Calretinin Focal +, WT-1+, D2-40+, MC-, CD10-, RCC-, CD15-, PAX8-, CDX-2-, SATB2-, CDH17-, GATA3-, CEA-, B72.3-, Ber-EP4-, GPC3-, Hepatocyte-, HMB45-, Melan-A-, S100-, a-inhibin-, CD117-, Dog-1-, Erg-, FLI-1-, P63-, SMA-, Desmin Focally +, Ki67 Index 20%, P53+, DES Focally +, TTF-1-, INI-1+.

Imaging revealed cirrhosis, splenomegaly, portal hypertension, and peritoneal effusion. Tumor indicators showed no obvious abnormalities on February 13, 2017. Abdominal effusion revealed shed cancer cells. Imaging diagnosis indicated a large amount of ascites.

On March 22, 2017, abdominal mesentery was slightly thickened. Laparoscopic peritoneal biopsy was performed, and hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed heterogeneous cell nests in the parietal peritoneal fiber tissue accompanied by degeneration. Immunohistochemical findings were Calretinin (+), WT-1 (\u00b1), and D2-40 (+), suggesting malignant mesothelioma. CDX-2 (\u2212) excluded tumors from the digestive tract, and ER (\u2212) excluded breast metastases. The patient was diagnosed with malignant mesothelioma.

The patient received nine cycles of pemetrexed combined with cisplatin (intravenous injection and abdominal perfusion) starting in March 2017. Clinical efficacy evaluation in October 2017 suggested disease progression, with increased ascites, local thickening of the peritoneum, and turbidity in the fat space of the mesentery.

The treatment plan was changed to gemcitabine combined with local intra-cavity perfusion. On February 19, 2020, follow-up assessment revealed the peritoneal lesion was larger than before. Gemcitabine chemotherapy was administered for four cycles due to the enlarged peritoneal lesion.

Laparoscopic peritoneal mesothelioma resection was performed on May 8, 2020, due to poor efficacy of gemcitabine chemotherapy. Peritoneal lesions were removed, and pathological examination was performed. Gemcitabine chemotherapy was continued twice after surgery.

On February 24, 2021, re-examination indicated that the tuberculum of the anterior hepatis was significantly larger than that of October 2020. On March 8, 2021, Laparoscopic peritoneal mesothelioma resection was performed again, and the tuberculum of the anterior hepatis was removed for pathological examination. After surgery, gemcitabine local infusion chemotherapy combined with deep tumor hyperthermia was administered four times.

Two years after the initial diagnosis, the patient presented to the emergency department with angina pectoris. On admission, blood tests revealed elevated high-sensitivity troponin and CK levels, leading to a diagnosis of ST-elevation AMI. A coronary angiogram showed total occlusion of the distal LAD, and attempts to wire the occluded vessel were unsuccessful. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed invasion of the heart apex by the metastatic tumor, with localized thickening of the apical left ventricular wall and localized wall motion asynergy.

On admission, he was hemodynamically stable without signs of cardiac decompensation. Elevated troponin and creatine kinase levels prompted emergency catheterization, which revealed a total occlusion of the distal left coronary artery attributed to tumour infiltration. Intervention attempts were unsuccessful, and given the palliative context, other revascularization strategies were not pursued. A two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiogram depicted tumour invasion at the heart’s apex, confirming the diagnosis. The patient passed away shortly after receiving palliative radiation therapy.

The tumor proportion score of programmed cell death ligand-1 was 20–30%. His medical history was notable for squamous cell carcinoma of the right lung, for which he had received chemoradiotherapy and lung lobectomy of the right upper lobe 19 years prior. He also had a smoking history of 30 pack-years.

In April, immunochemotherapy was initiated with nivolumab (360 mg IV every 3 weeks), ipilimumab (1 mg/kg IV every 6 weeks), carboplatin, and pemetrexed as induction therapy. He received 11 cycles of nivolumab and six cycles of ipilimumab combined with carboplatin and pemetrexed for the first two cycles (every 3 weeks). Carcinoembryonic antigen levels decreased from 23.8 ng/mL at referral to 5.2 ng/mL at the 10th cycle of nivolumab.

A CT scan at the 11th cycle of nivolumab revealed stable disease.

On October 20, the patient complained of dyspnea and manifested acute respiratory failure (arterial blood oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry was 85% under room air conditions). A chest CT scan revealed the emergence of diffuse grand-grass opacity predominantly in the left lower lobe of the lung. The primary lesions in the right lung did not progress. The serum carcinoembryonic antigen was 6.2 ng/mL.

After two cycles of docetaxel and ramucirumab, diffuse grand-grass opacity in the lungs regressed. Interstitial pneumonitis induced by immunotherapy was suspected.

The relationship between coronary artery disease (CAD) and lung cancer is potentially multifaceted, influenced by common risk factors and the adverse cardiac effects of cancer treatments.

We present a case of a Black American male undergoing combination therapy (chemotherapy/radiotherapy/immunotherapy) for small-cell lung cancer, who developed ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) seven months after beginning treatment.

This study underscores the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for acute coronary syndromes (ACS) in patients receiving lung cancer treatments, emphasizes the need for early recognition of warning signs, and highlights the critical role of risk factor management and enhanced surveillance in this vulnerable population.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and lung cancer are two leading causes of death globally, representing significant public health challenges.

The chest pain started 12 hours prior to the presentation and was described as mid-sternal, pressure-like, and squeezing in nature. The patient rated the pain as 8-9/10 in severity, with radiation to the left arm and jaw. The pain was transiently relieved by nitroglycerin and had no identifiable aggravating factors. The patient experienced shortness of breath (SOB) and occasional diaphoresis. He denied nausea, vomiting, palpitations, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND), or leg swelling.

Vital signs: blood pressure of 167/110 mmHg, heart rate of 139 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Physical examination revealed tachycardia but no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Respiratory examination was unremarkable with clear breath sounds bilaterally.

A repeat EKG revealed ST elevation in the anterior leads (V1-V4) and reciprocal changes in the inferior leads (II, III, AVF). Cardiology consultation was obtained, an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) protocol was activated, and the patient was transferred emergently to the catheterization laboratory. Coronary angiography revealed extensive thrombus in the proximal left anterior descending (LAD) artery, proximal circumflex artery, and high obtuse marginal (OM) branch.

Drug-eluting stents were successfully placed in the LAD and circumflex OM branches. Post-procedure left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) was estimated at 25%, down from 30% to 35% on an echocardiogram (2D echo) performed two weeks earlier. Anterior wall hypokinesis was also observed. The patient stabilized in the intensive care unit (ICU) on a regimen of aspirin, prasugrel, and tirofiban. Goal-directed medical therapy was initiated to manage blood pressure. A wearable defibrillator was placed for cardiac protection. The patient was discharged on apixaban and prasugrel due to suspected hypercoagulable state secondary to malignancy and recent cancer treatments.

However, the prognosis could be poor despite the presence of an acquired T790M resistance mutation, even after EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) treatment. The findings suggest that the T790M resistance mutation can occur even when the patient harbors an uncommon EGFR mutation after EGFR-TKI treatment. Further understanding of the clinical characteristics may help in the optimization of strategies to provide the maximum clinical benefit in patients with NSCLC harboring uncommon EGFR mutations.

graph_288,True,"A 60-year-old man with locally advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) underwent concurrent chemoradiotherapy. During the second course of chemoradiotherapy, he experienced grade 3 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, requiring dose reduction. Despite this, he completed the chemoradiotherapy.

Maintenance therapy with durvalumab was planned, but postponed due to sustained thrombocytopenia. A month later, after the platelet count recovered to 142 × 103/μL, durvalumab was initiated. Soon after, thrombocytopenia re-emerged, reaching a minimum level of 55 × 103/μL, despite normal hemoglobin concentration and white cell counts.

Durvalumab was discontinued after five cycles because the thrombocytopenia did not improve. Bone marrow specimen showed normoplasticity with marked megakaryocyte depletion, leading to a diagnosis of acquired amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenic purpura, inconsistent with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). The durvalumab-induced thrombocytopenia was attributed to this amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenic purpura, characterized by dysregulated immunity against thrombopoietin or its receptor.

Six months after discontinuing durvalumab, the platelet counts recovered to 110 × 103/μL. The case highlights the rare occurrence of hematological immune-related adverse events (irAEs), specifically immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, following durvalumab maintenance therapy after concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Although hematological irAEs are rare, occurring at a frequency of 0.5% for grade 2 or more, thrombocytopenia is the most common type. While immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are generally considered more tolerable than cytotoxic agents regarding hematological toxicity, fatal immune-mediated thrombocytopenia has been reported.

During chemoradiotherapy, he developed grade 3 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, necessitating a dose reduction in the second chemotherapy cycle. He completed the planned chemoradiotherapy.

Due to sustained thrombocytopenia, maintenance therapy with durvalumab was initially postponed. A coagulation test revealed hyperfibrinolysis. Durvalumab was initiated one month later, after his platelet count recovered to 142 x 10^3/µL.

A search of databases (Wanfang, CNKI, and PubMed) identified 7 relevant Chinese articles and 56 English articles, reporting a total of 16 cases. Combining the present case, a total of 17 cases were analyzed. Among these 17 patients with lung adenocarcinoma, 2 did not have EGFR gene mutation status reported. Of the 15 cases with EGFR testing, 1 patient had no mutation, 10 had EGFR exon 19 deletions, 1 was ALK positive, 1 had the EGFR exon 21 L858R mutation (like the index patient), and 2 had EGFR exon 20 insertions.

graph_290,True,"Squamous cell lung carcinoma (LUSC) is a prevalent type of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), accounting for approximately 25% to 30% of all NSCLCs. Epidemiological investigations have shown that LUSC occurs more commonly in elderly men and is more strongly associated with smoking than any other type of NSCLC. The early symptoms of LUSC are mild and easy to ignore. At the time of diagnosis, most patients are already in the advanced stage of the disease and often present with distal metastasis, which results in a poor prognosis of advanced LUSC with a 5-year survival rate of only 6%. LUSC originates from squamous cells and has a high rate of metastasis and recurrence. The lack of effective genetic targets and specific therapies has resulted in a poor prognosis for patients with LUSC.

This case report concerns a patient who was admitted to the hospital with coughing and hemoptysis. A tumor was found in his lung, and lesions were initially controlled with standard treatment. However, the patient’s tumor re-occurred again shortly for which treatment was lacking. Without effective treatment methods, the disease was difficult to control.

Gastrointestinal metastasis of LUSC is a rare occurrence in clinical practice. Patients with gastrointestinal metastasis usually have worse overall survival and the process of diagnosis is more complicated than those with metastasis elsewhere. What’s more, there are no helpful guidelines for treating patients with a clinically confirmed diagnosis of gastrointestinal metastasis, which means the treatment method is limited. Our learnings from the case demonstrate that LUSC metastasizes to secondary lymphoid organs of the gastrointestinal tract, usually with a poor prognosis.

graph_293,False,"A 63-year-old female presented with fecal incontinence, debilitating headaches, right arm weakness, gait instability, and a recent ground-level fall. This prompted imaging studies which revealed an 8 cm area of cerebral edema in the left parietal lobe, a 3.5 cm mass in the superior segment of the lower lobe of the right lung, numerous subcentimeter nodules throughout the lung parenchyma, and hilar lymphadenopathy. A CT-guided lung core needle biopsy confirmed invasive non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) with a prominent lepidic pattern. Lung mass biopsy revealed lung adenocarcinoma with a predominantly lepidic pattern. Immunohistochemical analysis showed positive staining for TTF-1, Napsin A, CK7, and CK5/6, and negative staining for CK20, P40, chromogranin, and synaptophysin. The cell proliferation index was estimated to be less than 3% via Ki-67 stains. Genpath OnkoSight histologic and tissue tumor next-generation sequencing revealed an EGFR Glu 757-Ala 750 deletion mutation, a rare exon 19 deletion variant.

The patient was treated with osimertinib. After 17 months of treatment with osimertinib, lung mass biopsy showed lung carcinosarcoma with islands of sarcomatoid spindled cells among solid epithelioid components (H&E, 200x). Biopsy of primary lung mass at initial diagnosis (Ki-67, 200x) showed positive staining in <5% of cells. Resistance to first- and second-generation TKIs developed. Collection date 2024 Apr. This was attributed to the development of resistance to osimertinib due to acquired resistance mechanisms, including EGFR-dependent and EGFR-independent mechanisms such as acquired EGFR mutations, amplifications, genetic fusions, MAPK-PI3K mutations, cell cycle gene alterations, and histologic transformation. After 17 months of treatment with osimertinib, fine-needle aspiration of 11R lymph node (Ki-67, 200x) showed Ki-67 positivity in >90% of cells.

The patient underwent stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and continued treatment with osimertinib 80 mg daily. After more than 17 months of treatment, follow-up imaging showed progressive and recurrent brain and chest lesions. Endobronchial ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration of the 11R lymph node confirmed a poorly differentiated malignancy consistent with metastatic carcinosarcoma. Further characterization of the metastatic recurrent lung cancer revealed a biphasic morphology with solid sheets of pleomorphic, neoplastic mesenchymal cells interspersed with small islands of neoplastic epithelial cells. Immunocytochemistry of 11R lymph node sample demonstrated positive staining for TTF-1, AE1/AE3, EMA, CD56, and vimentin with negative staining for CK7, P40, napsin, calretinin, PAX-8, S-100, synaptophysin, and chromogranin. Ki-67 staining revealed an estimated cell proliferation index of 90%. Foundation one next-generation sequencing identified an additional EGFR exon 19 deletion (E746_A750del) in addition to the previously identified EGFR G796C and 1744V point mutations. Notable novel mutations were also found."
graph_293,True,"Resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) remains a significant clinical challenge. Despite the established efficacy of first- and second-generation TKIs in the treatment of NSCLC, resistance to these agents can develop. Increasing resistance to the otherwise effective and well-tolerated pharmacologic interventions for NSCLC poses a significant clinical challenge. With the emergence of resistance, the efficacy of TKIs against NSCLC diminishes progressively; hence, gaining a deeper comprehension of resistance mechanisms to the remaining effective TKIs, like osimertinib, becomes crucial.

However, patients can develop acquired resistance to osimertinib within the first two years of use via heterogeneous and various possible mechanisms. Resistance to osimertinib can occur due to acquired resistance mechanisms, which can be categorized as EGFR-dependent or EGFR-independent. One possible mechanism by which resistance to osimertinib develops is via histologic transformation. Histologic transformation involves the transformation of adenocarcinoma to another histological subtype of lung carcinoma; previous studies have observed transformations to small cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma.

Here we present a case of histologic transformation from non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) to carcinosarcoma, possibly representing a new manifestation of osimertinib resistance. While histologic transformation has been previously reported, we present a novel histological transformation from adenocarcinoma to carcinosarcoma, leading to resistance to osimertinib and disease progression. This case represents an important and detrimental mechanism of resistance.

This case report presents a unique instance of histologic transformation from NSCLC to carcinosarcoma, representing a previously unreported manifestation of osimertinib resistance. The transformation was associated with additional EGFR mutations and alterations in RB and TP53. The most prevalent EGFR mutations involve in-frame deletions in exon 19 and a point mutation in exon 21 (L858R), together accounting for approximately 90% of EGFR alterations.

This case underscores the need for further research to elucidate the molecular mechanisms behind histologic transformation and explore novel therapeutic strategies to address osimertinib resistance in NSCLC. Understanding and addressing these mechanisms are crucial for improving outcomes in patients facing this challenging form of resistance.

A chest CT scan revealed a 7x4 cm irregular mass in the right middle lobe, local atelectasis, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and a 4x4 cm right lower hilar lymph node enlargement. Further SPECT imaging of a whole-body bone scan showed abnormal isotopic accumulation in multiple sites. A CT-guided lower lung biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. The final diagnosis was right lung adenocarcinoma with bone metastasis, staged as T4N2M1 stage IV.

In February 2018, the patient began treatment with 4 cycles of chemotherapy (GP regimen + recombinant human endostatin (Endostar)). Following this treatment, the patient experienced significant relief from coughing and shortness of breath. A follow-up chest CT scan showed a reduction in the right lung lesion to 3x3 cm, the size of the lower hilar lymph node decreased to 2.5x2.5 cm, and local atelectasis and pericardial effusion were alleviated.

However, in late June 2018, the patient developed coughing, shortness of breath, and lower back pain. A subsequent chest CT scan revealed elevated local atelectasis, a large amount of pericardial effusion, and bilateral pleural effusion.

A CT-guided biopsy confirmed adenocarcinoma, leading to a right middle lobectomy and lymph node dissection. The pathologic report revealed a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma (ADC) without lymph node or pleural involvement, staged as a pathologic T1b lesion, consistent with stage I lung cancer.

After a lobectomy for right middle lobe adenocarcinoma (ADC), the patient was diagnosed with synchronous small cell carcinoma (SCLC) in the right upper lobe and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in the right lower lobe. Pathology confirmed a poorly-differentiated small cell carcinoma (SCLC) in the RUL, as well as a moderately-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in the RLL lesion with metastasis to the right hilar lymph node. Her two new tumors were consistent with limited stage small cell carcinoma in RUL and stage II (T2, N1, M0) squamous cell carcinoma in RLL.

Given the complexities and her high surgical risk, a multidisciplinary tumor board recommended a combined treatment approach with radiation therapy and chemotherapy. However, during the simulation session for radiation therapy, new bilateral lung nodules were discovered, raising concerns about extensive stage malignancy from the small cell carcinoma. Consequently, immunotherapy with atezolizumab was integrated into her chemotherapy regimen of carboplatin and etoposide.

A chest CT scan revealed a 58 mm × 62 mm nodule in the left lung, accompanied by multiple smaller nodules, enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, and pleural effusions. Based on these findings, she was diagnosed with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma.

A lung biopsy specimen was sent for capture-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) using a panel of 168 cancer-related genes (Lung Plasma, Burning Rock, Guangzhou, China). The NGS analysis identified an EGFR c.2236_2250del (p.E746_A750del) mutation with an abundance of 11.52%.

Consequently, the patient was started on osimertinib (80 mg, qd) as the first-line therapy. Her symptoms improved rapidly, and a chest CT evaluation performed 12 weeks later demonstrated a partial response (PR), with the lung lesion significantly decreasing in size to 38 mm × 22 mm.

After 11 months of disease control, a follow-up CT scan showed an enlarged left lung mass, measuring 66 mm × 50 mm. Ultra-deep plasma-derived circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) NGS revealed the presence of the EGFR E746_A750del mutation (abundance 0.54%) and a TP53 H179R mutation (abundance 1.32%).

She was initially diagnosed with trigeminal neuralgia, but surgery did not improve her symptoms. The patient had no history of hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, or thyroid disease.

Later, the patient developed stiffness and painful spasms of the trunk axis and lower limb muscles, characteristic of Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS), a rare autoimmune disease of the central nervous system. Further investigation, including a CT-guided percutaneous lung biopsy, revealed focal alveolar epithelial dysplasia, diagnosed as adenocarcinoma in situ, a type of lung cancer. The possibility of withdrawal syndrome from clonazepam, which she had stopped taking six months prior, was excluded based on her medical history, clinical manifestations, laboratory, and imaging findings.

Ultimately, the patient was diagnosed with both Stiff Person Syndrome and lung adenocarcinoma. SPS is characterized by stiffness and painful spasms of the trunk axis and lower limb muscles with constant fluctuation and aggravation. Benzodiazepines are typically the first-line treatment for SPS. The case was considered a paraneoplastic stiff-person syndrome associated with lung cancer.

This case report details the presentation, diagnosis, and management of an acute pneumothorax in a patient with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) undergoing immunotherapy with pembrolizumab.

The patient was diagnosed with NSCLC. Prior to this diagnosis, the patient may have been screened for other cancers such as prostate cancer and breast cancer, given the mention of these in the body of the text. The patient presented with a pulmonary nodule, prompting further investigation.

Diagnostic workup likely involved bronchoscopic procedures, including radial-endobronchial ultrasound (R-EBUS) and convex probe endobronchial ultrasound (CP-EBUS), also referred to as EBUS. Electromagnetic navigation using the Veran SPiNDrive system may have been utilized to guide the bronchoscopic procedures. Other diagnostic modalities such as transthoracic needle biopsy and CONE BEAM CT may have been considered or employed. Techniques like archimedes bronchoscopic trans-parenchymal nodule biopsy or bronchoscopic transparenchymal nodule access using thin-EBUS may have been used to obtain tissue samples. The staging of the NSCLC was a crucial step in determining the appropriate treatment strategy.

The patient was initiated on immunotherapy with pembrolizumab.

During the course of treatment, the patient developed an acute pneumothorax, requiring immediate medical intervention.

Prior to immunotherapy, the patient may have been considered for targeted therapies such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) if their tumor harbored mutations in epidermal growth factor (EGFR), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), ROS proto-oncogene 1 (ROS1), or proto-oncogene B-Raf (BRAF).

High-resolution chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a giant left lung mass with a massive left pleural effusion causing mediastinal shift to the right. Left-sided thoracentesis revealed that the pleural effusion was exudative with lymphocyte predominance. Cytological examination detected adenocarcinoma cells negative for thyroid transcription factor-1 and napsin A, but the number of tumor cells was insufficient for a definitive diagnosis.

Two thoracenteses did not allow for a diagnosis, but thoracoscopic pleural biopsy showed features of small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), adenocarcinoma, and a spindle-shaped cell tumor. Despite these findings, the patient could not be treated with chemotherapy. The patient's tumor increased by 2.59-fold in size in 20 days. He eventually died from a rapidly progressive tumor. Autopsy led to a diagnosis of combined small cell lung carcinoma (C-SCLC) with three different components: SCLC, adenocarcinoma, and a spindle-shaped cell tumor. The combination of C-SCLC with spindle-shaped cell tumor suggested rapid progression and a poor prognosis.

graph_315,True,"A patient with Stage IIIB primary lung cancer developed several immune-related adverse events following treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors. The patient experienced a complex clinical course involving various episodes of cystitis. Initially, the patient presented with lower urinary tract symptoms, including micturition pain and glans penile pain. This was diagnosed as bacterial cystitis with pyuria and inflammatory findings. However, the patient subsequently developed non-bacterial cystitis, which recurred multiple times. The cystitis proved to be steroid-resistant, evolving into a steroid-resistant immune-related adverse event. The patient's clinical picture was further complicated by the presence of colitis. The patient's history also included concerns about other cancers and tumors, although the primary focus remained on the lung cancer and the associated immune-related adverse events, specifically the refractory cystitis. The differential diagnosis included interstitial cystitis, but the recurrent nature and association with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy strongly suggested an immune-mediated etiology. The presence of stones was also considered but ruled out. The patient experienced multiple episodes of cystitis, both bacterial and non-bacterial, highlighting the challenges in managing immune-related adverse events in the context of lung cancer treatment.

graph_315,False,"The patient presented with symptoms suggestive of cystitis. Urine culture and urine cytology were negative. Cystoscopy showed diffuse mucosal redness and bleeding. The patient was started on methylprednisolone 60 mg/day (1 mg/kg). Symptoms and cystoscopic inflammatory findings improved immediately. Methylprednisolone was reduced to 20 mg/day and the patient was discharged home while continuing methylprednisolone 20 mg/day. One month after discharge, the patient experienced a recurrence of glans penile pain, micturition pain, and pyuria. Cystoscopy revealed inflammatory findings in the bladder mucosa. Urine culture was negative again. One month after discharge, the dose of methylprednisolone was gradually increased, but symptoms markedly enhanced. The dose of methylprednisolone was increased to 60 mg/day, 3 weeks after the recurrence of symptoms. After increasing the dose of methylprednisolone to 60 mg/day, the symptoms and pyuria improved. It was difficult to reduce the dose of methylprednisolone below 40 mg/day. Infliximab (5 mg/kg) administered in conjunction with methylprednisolone. Symptoms of steroid-resistant cystitis were relieved early by concomitant use of infliximab."
graph_316,True,"Haemothorax is an accumulation of blood in the pleural space. Retained haemothorax refers to blood that cannot be drained from the pleural cavity and is associated with an increased risk of empyema and fibrothorax often necessitating surgical evacuation. This case series describes the experience of using intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy in three patients with different bleeding risks and acute non-traumatic retained haemothorax.

The first patient was a 41-year-old female with disseminated *Candida guilliermondii* sepsis and an iatrogenic haemothorax. The second patient was a 48-year-old female with transfusion-dependent acute myeloid leukaemia and spontaneous haemothorax. The third patient was a 72-year-old female with spontaneous haemothorax from newly diagnosed lung cancer.

All patients received one to two doses of intrapleural alteplase without any bleeding complications. The treatment resulted in the resolution of retained haemothorax in all three patients. This case series demonstrates the successful application and safety of intrapleural alteplase as an alternative to surgery in a well-resourced environment with close monitoring and ready access to blood transfusion.

Chest CT showed circumferential nodular right-sided pleural thickening with associated pleural effusion and a 2-cm nodule in the right lower lobe. Thoracic ultrasound (TUS) showed a simple effusion, and 500 mL of dark brown fluid (degraded haemoglobin) was aspirated. Three days after the initial aspiration, the patient re-presented with chest pain. Chest X-ray (CXR) and CT scan showed reaccumulation of the pleural effusion. Thoracic ultrasound (TUS) showed the effusion was heavily septated. A 12-Fr ICD was inserted into the septated collection under ultrasound guidance, draining minimal dark sanguineous fluid with a pleural fluid/serum haematocrit ratio of 0.58, suggestive of interval pleural haemorrhage. A single dose of intrapleural alteplase 10 mg was given 30 min after ICD insertion, resulting in a further 1400 mL of drain output. Repeat CXR showed a significant reduction in the volume of effusion and revealed underlying trapped lung. Fluid cytology was positive for lung adenocarcinoma, and haemoglobin remained stable."

He was a former smoker between the ages of 15 and 35-years-old but had not smoked in over 30 years. The patient has a family history of prostate cancer. Visual acuity was 20/20 + 2 in the right eye and 20/15 in the left eye. Intraocular pressure was normal in each eye. Anterior segment examination was unremarkable.

Dilated funduscopic examination of the right eye was unremarkable. Left eye examination revealed a 7.5x6.0x < 1 mm amelanotic choroidal lesion centered just below the inferotemporal arcade with overlying subretinal fluid extending inferiorly, and mild retinal pigment epithelial changes over the lesion surface. No lipofuscin or drusen was visualized. No other lesions were seen on scleral depressed examination. OCT showed a lumpy-bumpy choroidal lesion with extensive overlying subretinal fluid.

Echography of the left eye revealed an irregular mass with high internal reflectivity, no vascularity, and less than 1 mm in thickness. A-scan echo thickness includes both the lesion and the retina that is shallowly detached over the surface. Findings were concerning for a choroidal metastasis from an unknown primary malignancy. The patient was referred to hematology-oncology service for evaluation."

Systemic evaluation identified widely metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung with EGFR exon 19 mutation. The patient also had central nervous system metastases. He was treated with osimertinib, a third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor, as the first-line treatment. Within one month of initiating treatment with osimertinib, there was complete resolution of the subretinal fluid over the choroidal lesion and decreased thickness of the lesion. At follow-up after three months of treatment, the lesion was clinically involuted. Positron emission tomography at two months and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain at three months showed significant interval decrease in size and activity of the primary right lung lesion, central nervous system lesions, and other metastatic sites with no new metastatic lesions.

graph_318,False,"A 71-year-old woman presented with left upper and right lower lung field nodules on chest CT. The left upper lung field nodule was diagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma with high PD-L1 expression (70%) via endobronchial ultrasound with guide sheath. 18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography showed uptake in both nodules. The cancer stage was determined as cT3N0M1a.

The patient was treated with 13 cycles of pembrolizumab every 3 weeks. Follow-up chest CT revealed a dramatic decrease in the size of the 60-mm lesion in the left upper lobe. However, the size of the 10-mm lesion in the right lower lobe had significantly increased.

A CT-guided transthoracic needle biopsy (CTNB) of the right lower lung nodule was performed. Pathological findings revealed squamous cell carcinoma with nonexpression of PD-L1 in the right lower nodule.

Due to the ineffective treatment of the right lower nodule, likely related to PD-L1 nonexpression, and following discussion with the cancer board, right lower lobectomy was recommended.

The patient also has a history of severe bronchial asthma. She has a 20-year history of refractory asthma treated with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), long-acting beta-agonists (LABA), long-acting muscarinic antagonists, and antiallergic drug therapy.

CT revealed an ill-defined soft tissue dense hilar lesion in the right hilum encasing the right main bronchus, right upper lobe bronchus, and middle lobe bronchus. There was collapse of the right middle lobe and encasement of the right descending pulmonary artery. Mediastinal lymph nodes were noted in right upper paratracheal, right lower paratracheal (1 cm in short axis), left lower paratracheal, subcarinal (1.1 cm in short axis) and paraesophageal. Bronchoscopy revealed a tumour in the distal right middle lobe measuring 0.5–1 cm from the origin. Histopathological examination (HPE) confirmed adenocarcinoma with a signet ring cell morphology. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed positivity for CK 7 and TTF-1, while synaptophysin was negative. Whole-body PET-CT scan demonstrated FDG-avid soft tissue lesions with areas of cavitation in the hilum extending into the right middle lobe, causing cutoff of the right middle lobe bronchus and encasement of the right superior pulmonary vein. FDG-avid lymph nodes were observed in the right hilar, right upper paratracheal, and subcarinal regions. Staging revealed cT4b N2M0–STAGE IIIB disease. The Multidisciplinary Tumour Board (MDTB) recommended induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation. In January 2016, a PET-CT after three courses of pemetrexed carboplatin showed poor response. The patient received second-line chemotherapy with cisplatin and docetaxel for four cycles.

graph_325,True,"A 62-year-old male farmer with a 30-year smoking history (360 pack-years), suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pulmonary bullae, was admitted to the hospital for intermittent hemoptysis of approximately 2 years duration. Prior to admission, he had been diagnosed with and treated for pneumonia and bronchiectasis with antibiotics and hemostatics, but a definite diagnosis for the hemoptysis could not be established.

A thorax-computed tomography revealed narrowing of the bronchus of the left lower lobe with associated local atelectasis, raising suspicion for lung cancer. To confirm the diagnosis and exclude lung cancer, a bronchoscopy was performed. The bronchoscopy showed a slit-like stenosis at the dorsal bronchial segment of the left lower lobe, swollen and smooth mucosa, and a significantly wider subsection carina.

During biopsy at the carina of the dorsal bronchial segment, a large hemorrhage occurred immediately. The patient developed hemorrhagic shock, and anti-shock measures were implemented, including intravenous infusion with polygeline, compound sodium chloride solution, dopamine, and type-A erythrocyte suspension.

Three hours later, the patient developed a recurrent massive hemoptysis. Double-lumen endotracheal intubation was performed immediately, and single-lung ventilation was started to maintain oxygenation. A fatal hemorrhage occurred during biopsy and, rescue and resuscitation measures were immediately taken. Hemoptysis completely stopped after bronchial artery embolization. However, the patient eventually died of disseminative intravascular coagulation and multiple organ failure.

This case highlights the potential for bronchial Dieulafoy's disease to cause massive or fatal hemoptysis. Dieulafoy's lesions are characterized by the presence of a dysplastic artery in the submucosa, most frequently associated with gastrointestinal hemorrhage, but rarely identified in the bronchial submucosa. In cases with recurrent unexplained hemoptysis, where CT chest or thoracic radiography show no abnormalities, pulmonologists should suspect a bronchial Dieulafoy's disease and avoid blindly performing bronchoscopy guided biopsy, which may result in fatal hemoptysis.

The chest pain symptoms were somewhat relieved by oral Ibuprofen, but the effect quickly receded. A chest CT scan revealed a 3.8 cm space-occupying lesion in the upper lobe of the right lung with clear boundaries and uneven internal density. The radiologist suggested it may be a benign lesion, possibly a haematoma.

Further imaging with a 16-slice computed tomographic scan showed a mass image in the upper lobe of the right lung adjacent to the chest wall. The tubercle boundary was clear and the internal density was uneven. Careful examination showed that the mass had a pedicle. The lung lesion was then diagnosed as a schwannoma.

A needle biopsy confirmed the lesion as a schwannoma. The fine needle puncture procedure was smooth, with no complications such as bleeding or pneumothorax.

The patient underwent video-assisted thoracic surgery in an outside hospital but was lost to follow-up. Histologic diagnosis from the mass confirmed schwannoma.

graph_341,False,"A 43-year-old woman presented with occupation of the upper lobe of the right lung during a physical examination. Initial workup included a chest CT scan on 2020-10-22, which revealed a nodule in the upper lobe of the right lung (0.8 x 0.4 cm) and bulky swollen mediastinal lymph nodes (4.4 x 3.3 cm). A PET/CT scan indicated a mildly fluorodeoxyglucose-avid nodule in the right upper lobe, and high metabolic nodules and masses in the mediastinum 2R and 4R groups. Tumor marker tests on 2020-10-23 showed CEA at 145.20 ng/mL, CA199 at 27.47 ng/mL, and CA724 at 7.17 ng/mL. A needle biopsy of the mediastinal lymph nodes revealed lung adenocarcinoma with Ki-67 > 60% and PD-L1 > 50%. Genetic testing was negative for EGFR, ALK, KRAS, RET, and ROS1 mutations. The patient was diagnosed with stage IIIA NSCLC (cT1N2M0) with no evidence of distant metastatic disease.

The patient underwent two cycles of neoadjuvant sintilimab plus chemotherapy. A chest CT scan on 2020-12-01, after two cycles of neoadjuvant therapy, showed a mildly FDG-avid mass in the upper lobe of the right lung (SUVmax= 1.0) and intensely FDG-avid lymph nodes in the mediastinum 2R and 4R groups (SUVmax= 14.0) on PET-CT before neoadjuvant therapy. After two cycles of sintilimab combined with nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin, the target lesion was slightly reduced (0.8 x 0.3 cm) and the efficacy was evaluated as stable disease. The mediastinal lymph nodes were significantly narrower compared to before (2.2 x 1.7 cm) and the efficacy was evaluated as partial response (PR) on the basis of RECIST version 1.1.

Asynchrony of primary tumor and mediastinal lymph nodes remission was found, as well as the mismatch between the imaging and pathology. The patient's vital signs were stable, and no signs of recurrence were observed.

On 2020-12-15, the patient underwent right upper lung lobectomy plus lymph nodes dissection via thoracoscopy, achieving margin-negative (R0) resection. Postoperative chronic pathology revealed no cancer residue."

Initial treatment involved androgen deprivation therapy, including bilateral orchidectomy and antiandrogen treatment with bicalutamide tablets. The patient later developed castration-resistant disease, characterized by rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and the presence of bone metastatic lesions. This progression led to a diagnosis of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Docetaxel treatment was initiated. The patient presented with multiple bone metastases and leukopenia. The patient had metastatic castration-sensitive PCa. The patient experienced metastatic relapse and castration-resistance. Cytoreductive local treatment, including cytoreductive prostatectomy, was considered in the context of oligometastasis. The patient had adenocarcinoma with nodal involvement and distant metastasis. The patient had lethal PCa. The patient had diverse cancers, including breast cancer and lung cancer, treated with carboplatin and platinum chemotherapy.

Further investigation via prostate biopsy demonstrated adenocarcinoma with a Gleason score of 7 (4 + 3). Imaging was performed to assess the extent of the disease. Magnetic resonance imaging examination showed abnormal signals on both sides of the prostate. Further imaging to evaluate for metastasis was conducted, and a bone scan showed two bone metastatic lesions. Diagnosis and staging based on imaging results revealed a clinical stage of cT2N0M1b at diagnosis. The bone scan showed bone metastatic lesions in the left ilium and the 12th thoracic vertebra. The patient underwent bilateral orchidectomy on May 25th, 2018, followed by castrate levels of testosterone and antiandrogen treatment with bicalutamide tablets 50 mg daily. The patient underwent androgen deprivation therapy, followed by imaging to assess treatment response. A Ga-68 PSMA PET-CT showed multiple bone metastases lesions after 4 months of androgen deprivation therapy. The patient underwent six cycles of carboplatin chemotherapy, followed by imaging to assess treatment response. A bone scan showed one bone metastatic lesion in the left ilium after chemotherapy. Monitoring of PSA levels following treatment showed a PSA level decreased to 0.17 ng/ml on August 29th, 2018."
graph_343,False,"A patient presented with left abdominal pain for one month. Diagnostic imaging with PET-CT revealed soft tissue lesions in the left upper lobe of the lung with increased FDG metabolism, suggesting possible lung cancer. An enlarged left hilar lymph node was also noted. Soft tissue density shadows in bilateral adrenal glands and the left kidney posteromedial were considered as metastases. The patient was diagnosed with pulmonary enteric adenocarcinoma (PEAC). PEAC pathological features showed enteric origin or enteric morphology similar to lung metastatic colorectal cancer (lmCRC). Diagnostic criteria included colorectal morphologic cells exceeding 50% of the tumor tissue and positive for at least one colorectal immunophenotype, including CDX-2, CK20, SATB2, and MUC2, Villin, clinically excluding colorectal cancer.

To further evaluate the lung lesion, a CT-guided biopsy of the left lung lesion was performed. Pathology results suggested adenocarcinoma with poor expression of pulmonary markers. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed: TTF-1 (-), CK7 (+), Napsin A (-), CEA (+), CK5/6 (+), Syn (-), P63 (-), Ki-67+ (50%). Genetic test results revealed a KRAS mutation abundance of 31.22%. No EGFR, AKL, ROS-1, MET, or HER-2 mutations were found. PD-L1 expression status was unknown.

Based on these findings, the patient was determined to be at clinical stage IV. Treatment was initiated with the first cycle of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) plus platinum-based chemotherapy: Tislelizumab 200mg d1 + pemetrexed 500mg/m2 d1 + cisplatin 75mg/m2 d2, every 3 weeks."

A 61-year-old male with a 30-year smoking history of 20 cigarettes per day presented in July 2023 with left abdominal pain of one month's duration, for which he had received no prior treatment. He had no family history of genetic diseases, alcohol consumption, or psychiatric disorders.

In August 2023, a positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scan revealed soft tissue lesions in the left upper lobe of the lung with increased FDG metabolism, suggestive of lung cancer. Enlargement of the left hilar lymph node was also noted. Soft tissue density shadows in both adrenal glands and the left kidney posteromedial region were considered metastases. A computed tomography (CT)-guided biopsy of the left lung lesion was performed. Pathological results indicated adenocarcinoma, but pulmonary marker expression was poor. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed: TTF-1 (-), CK7 (+), Napsin A (-), CEA (+), CK5/6 (+), Syn (-), P63 (-), Ki-67+ (50%). Genetic testing revealed a KRAS mutation abundance of 31.22%, with no EGFR, AKL, ROS-1, MET, or HER-2 mutations detected. PD-L1 expression status was unknown. Given the presence of multiple metastases at presentation, the patient was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer, precluding radical surgery.

The patient received two cycles of first-line treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) plus platinum-based chemotherapy, specifically Tislelizumab 200mg d1 + pemetrexed 500mg/m2 d1 + cisplatin 75mg/m2 d2, every 3 weeks, initiated on August 19, 2023, and September 10, 2023, respectively. However, disease progression occurred after these two cycles, resulting in a progression-free survival (PFS) of 1.5 months.

On October 15, 2023, the patient presented to the Oncology Department of Jining First People’s Hospital due to worsening left abdominal pain for one week. The pain was affecting sleep and activity, necessitating oxycodone sustained-release tablet 10mg every 12 hours for pain relief. On October 16, 2023, serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level was > 979.0ng/ml (reference range 0-5).

The second-line treatment was adjusted to the XELOX regimen (oxaliplatin combined with capecitabine). After 2 and 4 cycles, the lesions were significantly reduced. However, the disease progressed again after 6 cycles, with a PFS of 4.5 months. Anlotinib targeted drugs were considered for third-line treatment, but given the patient's overall poor condition, he refused further treatment. Following discharge, the patient sought nutritional support and symptomatic treatment at a local hospital.

The results suggest that standard first-line therapies (immunotherapy plus chemotherapy) and colorectal cancer regimens may have a relatively limited impact on survival in KRAS-driver positive advanced pulmonary enteric adenocarcinoma.

graph_344,True,"We encountered a case of interleukin‐5 (IL‐5)‐producing malignant pleural mesothelioma with eosinophilic pleural effusion. There have been few reports of IL‐5‐producing tumors, and this is the first report of IL‐5‐producing malignant pleural mesothelioma.

The patient was diagnosed with malignant pleural mesothelioma by pleural biopsy, with eosinophilic pleural effusion. IL‐5 in the pleural effusion increased, and tumor cells were IL‐5‐positive by immunostaining. Host‐tumor cell interactions cause eosinophilic pleural effusion. In patients with eosinophilic pleural effusion, malignant pleural effusion should be considered. It is necessary to clarify the pathophysiology of malignant tumors and eosinophils.

Malignant pleural mesothelioma was suspected. Thus, using cell blocks prepared from the pleural effusion, p16 homozygous deletion was confirmed by p16 fluorescence in situ hybridization because 45% of the tumor cells showed loss of both p16 gene signals. Thoracoscopic biopsy of parietal pleura confirmed the diagnosis because of the tumor invasion to the pleura and adipose tissue. Biphasic malignant pleural mesothelioma with 70% epithelioid cells and 30% sarcomatoid cells was diagnosed. After examination, including 18‐fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG‐PET/CT), the patient was clinically diagnosed with malignant pleural mesothelioma cT3N2M0 stage III.

Immunostaining of the tumor tissue showed positive staining for IL‐5. Thus, IL‐5 production from malignant pleural mesothelioma cells was suggested.

The patient was diagnosed with biphasic malignant pleural mesothelioma. Chemotherapy (cisplatin and pemetrexed) was performed at monthly intervals for a total of three cycles. However, his condition progressed, and he was transferred to a hospice and died about a year later.

Of the patients, 5 (23.8%) had stage IIA, 3 (14.3%) had stage IIB, and 13 (61.9%) had stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Histopathology revealed adenocarcinoma in 14 patients (66.7%) and squamous cell carcinoma in 6 (28.6%). The cohort consisted of 15 male patients (71.4%) and 6 female patients (28.6%). ECOG performance status was 0 in 13 patients (61.9%) and 1 in 8 patients (38.1%).

Inclusion criteria included being over 20 years of age, having completely resected stage II to IIIA NSCLC, an ECOG performance status of 0-1, being judged unsuitable or unwilling to receive a cisplatin-based regimen, adequate kidney function (serum creatinine ≤1.5 mg/dL), adequate liver function, and adequate bone marrow function. Surgery was completed 4-8 weeks before enrollment.

Patients received four cycles of carboplatin (CBDCA) (AUC=5 mg/mL/min, on day 1) and nab-paclitaxel (nab-PTX) (100 mg/m2, on days 1, 8, and 15) as postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy every 4 weeks within 8 weeks after surgery.

Chemotherapy was stopped if tumor recurrence was detected or the next cycle was delayed for more than 28 days; occurrence of drug-induced pneumonitis grade 2 or worse; detection of grade 4 or worse nonhematologic toxicities; and deterioration of the patient’s condition due to severe toxicity or worsening comorbidities.

Follow-up included physical examination, laboratory tests, and chest x-ray every 3 months. Chest and abdominal computed tomography (CT) was performed every 6 months. Chest and abdominal CT, brain magnetic resonance imaging or brain CT, and 18F-FDG-PET were performed 2 years after registration.

CBDCA (AUC=6 mg/mL/min, on day 1) plus nab-PTX (100 mg/m2, on days 1, 8, 15) administered every 3 weeks produced a significantly higher overall response rate, as well as a 10% improvement in overall survival, than solvent-based paclitaxel (sb-PTX). 12 patients completed the four cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy.

The swelling, located on the left cheek region, initially presented as small but gradually increased to a size of 5 cm × 4 cm, causing mild facial asymmetry. The swelling extended from the infraorbital rim to the line joining the ala of the nose and ear lobule, and anteroposteriorly on the buccal mucosa from the distal aspect of the 24-28 region. On palpation, the swelling was nontender and firm in consistency.

Due to the facial swelling, an incisional biopsy was performed for histological evaluation. Macroscopic examination of the incisional biopsy revealed a single creamish brown soft-tissue bit, measuring 1.0 cm × 1.0 cm, with a firm consistency.

Microscopic examination of the incisional biopsy (H&E stain) showed a highly cellular connective tissue stroma with nests and sheets of small round-to-ovoid cells, ill-defined borders, scanty cytoplasm, and finely granular nuclear chromatin. Numerous foci of spindle-shaped cells with pleomorphic, hyperchromatic nuclei and inconspicuous nucleoli were observed. Increased mitoses (2–3 per five high-power field) were intermixed with foci of necrosis and hemorrhage. Dense connective tissue with collagen fiber bundles was also present.

Based on the H&E findings, a preliminary diagnosis of poorly differentiated round cell tumor was made. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed positive expression to CK 8/18 and CD56, and negative expression to CK20, CD45 and S-100.

She also presented with an increase in abdominal pain, for which a computed tomography (CT) of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis was carried out, revealing peritoneal effusion with signs of peritoneal carcinomatosis, especially in the lesser omentum, and edema of the adnexa, suggesting secondary involvement. An abdominal ultrasound confirmed aspects suggestive of peritoneal carcinomatosis. The exam revealed hypermetabolic abdominal-pelvic adenopathies and extensive diffuse hypermetabolic peritoneal densifications with peritoneal effusion, suggestive aspects of peritoneal carcinomatosis.

graph_364,True,"A 57-year-old woman presented on October 4, 2022, with “coughing discomfort for half a month and a 2-day history of right lung occupancy.” She had been admitted to the hospital half a month prior with a cough, dry cough, and low-grade fever. Anti-infective treatment at a local hospital was ineffective. A chest CT scan revealed solid nodules in the upper lobe of the right lung (22 × 15 mm), suggestive of a tumor lesion, and multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum and right hilum (the largest being 3.4 cm in diameter), raising concerns for metastasis. A subsequent chest CT with contrast showed a solid nodule in the anterior segment of the upper lobe of the right lung, measuring approximately 22 × 15 mm, with ring-shaped enhancement, further supporting the suspicion of a malignant tumor lesion. A pure ground-glass nodule was also identified in the lateral segment of the middle lobe of the right lung, measuring about 14 × 10 mm, with adjacent pleural stretching, and a tumor lesion could not be excluded. The enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum and right hilum also exhibited ring-shaped enhancement, consistent with metastasis. The patient was ultimately diagnosed with Pulmonary mucoepidermoid carcinoma (PMEC), a rare primary lung cancer, in combination with an ALK mutation. PMEC combined with ALK mutation is an extremely rare primary lung cancer, and the diagnosis is mainly based on pathology, histology and immunohistochemistry. After treatment, the patient’s cough and fever were controlled, her diet improved significantly, and she gained 20 pounds in 6 months.

graph_365,True,"A 74-year-old female diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma was referred to the hospital with chest tightness and shortness of breath. She had been treated with osimertinib plus savolitinib. Chest CT showed interstitial changes in both lungs, leading to a diagnosis of drug-related interstitial lung disease. The patient was treated with glucocorticoids, anti-infection measures, and mechanical ventilation. At the 1-year follow-up visit, the patient's interstitial lung disease was relatively stable. However, the patient passed away due to tumor progression. This case reports the development of interstitial lung disease in a patient with advanced lung cancer who developed it during treatment with savolitinib after resistance to osimertinib. MET-TKI is a late-stage treatment for drug-resistant NSCLC that has been marketed in recent years, and interstitial lung disease may be a rare adverse reaction.

graph_365,False,"A 74-year-old Asian female was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the left lung with bone metastasis in August 2019. Treatment was initiated with EGFR-TKIs, including gefitinib and eclitinib. Due to disease progression, the patient started osimertinib 80 mg/day one year prior to presentation. Osimertinib was discontinued 9 months prior due to Torsades de pointes. Eight months prior, reexamination found lung tumor progression; osimertinib 80 mg/day was restarted with close potassium monitoring and oral potassium supplementation. In January 2022, due to resistance to osimertinib, combination therapy of osimertinib 80 mg/day and savolitinib 200 mg/12 hours was initiated after genetic testing. The patient subsequently developed chest tightness, shortness of breath, cough, and yellow and white sticky sputum. Chest tightness and shortness of breath worsened, with paroxysmal dyspnea occurring at night. The patient received anti-infection diuretic treatment at a health center with poor results. A chest CT scan showed anterior bronchial occlusion of the upper lobe of the left lung, lung cancer with obstructive pneumonia or atelectasis, extensive interstitial changes in both lungs, and partial consolidation in both lungs, more obvious in the right lung. The patient presented to the emergency department with blood oxygen saturation of 85%, CRP 96mg/L, cardiac ultrasound EF value 46%, and crackles in both lungs.

His past medical history included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease stadium-3, well controlled with medications. On presentation, his oxygen saturation was 93%. Physical examination showed no abnormalities. Initial investigations revealed a normal full blood count, normal venous blood gas, C-reactive protein levels, and no evidence of clotting disorders. Chest radiography showed no abnormal shadows. The patient was admitted to hospital for further management. On Day 2 of admission, the patient’s general condition deteriorated. A CT chest angiogram revealed a 5.7 x 4.2 x 5.0 cm mass in the right pulmonary artery. No enlarged lymph nodes or signs of metastasis were found. The patient was managed as thromboembolism occlusion in the right pulmonary artery and received anticoagulation therapy, but no improvement occurred. A follow-up CT chest angiogram 2 weeks later showed no improvement of the pulmonary artery mass; however, a new finding of 1.5 cm pleural fluid in the right lung was discovered. An MRI of the chest revealed increasing pleural fluid with intraluminal filling defects involving the right pulmonary artery, citing pulmonary thromboembolism as the main differential diagnosis. A PET-CT scan revealed a large invasive obstructing homogenous mass in the right pulmonary artery with high fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake of 25.2 SUV max, no FDG uptake in mediastinal lymph nodes or other organs. Endoscopy-guided biopsy of the mass revealed non-small-cell carcinoma. The patient is receiving ongoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy."
graph_366,True,"A patient presented with chest pain and dyspnoea. The patient's medical history included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and a possible predisposition to clotting disorders. Initial assessment included oxygen saturation monitoring and chest radiography. A computed tomography (CT) chest angiogram revealed a mass in the right pulmonary artery, raising suspicion for pulmonary thromboembolism. Enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes and pleural fluid were also noted.

Further investigation with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed intraluminal filling defects. A positron emission tomography (PET-CT) scan showed an invasive obstructing homogenous mass with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in the mediastinal lymph nodes.

An endoscopy-guided biopsy was performed, and histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of non-small-cell carcinoma. The initial suspicion of pulmonary thromboembolism was complicated by the presence of the tumour. The mass in the pulmonary artery was determined to be related to tumour embolisation.

The patient was initially started on anticoagulation therapy, presumably to address the suspected thromboembolism. However, given the diagnosis of non-small-cell carcinoma, the treatment plan was adjusted to include chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

Despite treatment, the patient developed metastasis. Further investigation revealed the presence of angiosarcoma, a rare type of sarcoma, within the intravascular lumen. The patient also experienced haemoptysis. The final diagnosis was a complex presentation of non-small-cell carcinoma with angiosarcoma, leading to tumour embolisation and mimicking pulmonary thromboembolism. The patient's prognosis was guarded given the advanced stage and aggressive nature of the malignancies.

A subsequent CT scan revealed a 3.7 cm mass in the left lower lobe adjacent to the diaphragm and a 1.7 cm mass in the lingula, both closely associated with the pleura. Thoracoscopic lung biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). The disease was staged as stage IV due to the multifocal pleural involvement and the risk of intrathoracic spread.

The patient received four cycles of cisplatin (CDDP; 75 mg/m²) and pemetrexed (PEM; 500 mg/m²). Following this, the patient received PEM monotherapy (500 mg/m²) every three weeks for a total of 25 courses, starting one year after diagnosis and continuing until the third year. In the third year following diagnosis, the patient commenced nivolumab therapy (200 mg every two weeks), continuing until the fifth year (50 courses).

Despite chemotherapy, pleural lesions gradually increased in size, and a right adrenal metastasis appeared. The patient's primary complaint was abdominal discomfort in the left abdominal region. A CT scan revealed a lesion in the pleura in the vicinity of the 10th and 11th ribs. An abdominal CT image after chemotherapy showed multiple pleural lesions exhibited increased size and extended specifically between the 10th and 11th intercostal spaces, resulting in abdominal discomfort on the left side. Metastasis to the right adrenal gland was evident on imaging.

Radiation therapy (RT) was administered to pleural lesions in the 10th and 11th intercostal spaces on the left chest wall using three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT), delivering a total dose of 39 Gy in 13 fractions, which effectively alleviated the pain. Four months later, 3DCRT was performed to treat the right adrenal gland, delivering 30 Gy in 10 fractions. Finally, 20 Gy in five fractions was administered to pleural lesions in the ninth intercostal space."

The primary lung cancer lesion, with a maximum diameter of 59 mm, was located in the right lower lobe. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy and two brain metastases, 7.0 and 4.0 mm in size, were also observed. Pathological examination of a biopsy specimen from the primary lesion, obtained by bronchoscopy, confirmed adenocarcinoma. The tumor had neither an epidermal growth factor receptor gene mutation nor an echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4-anaplastic lymphoma kinase fusion. Ten months prior to the lung cancer diagnosis, the patient had a history of bleeding from a cavernous hemangioma in the brain.

The patient's PD-L1 expression tumor proportion score was 1-24%. Serum hepatitis B virus (HBV)-DNA was detected (<0.1 IU/mL), and the patient was treated with entecavir until negative conversion. Stereotactic ablative surgery was performed on the two small brain metastases. First-line chemotherapy, consisting of 4 cycles of carboplatin (area under the curve =5) and pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) and pembrolizumab (200 mg/body), was initiated, followed by pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) and pembrolizumab (200 mg/body) maintenance therapy.

Pemetrexed was stopped after two cycles of maintenance therapy due to worsening anemia, and pembrolizumab was continued as monotherapy.

Approximately 4 months after pembrolizumab monotherapy initiation, a 1.9-mm nodule appeared in the right S3 lesion. The lung cancer showed some response to the treatment. Very small nodules were confirmed in the right S3 lesion at the time of the diagnosis of lung cancer.

Seven months after anticancer therapy initiation, the right S3 nodule showed no significant change in size or lung cancer. The patient's CRP level was 0.09 mg/dL. Three consecutive sputum tests for acid-fast bacilli were performed: all smears were negative, but the culture was positive for acid-fast bacilli 17 days after incubation, and confirmed to be M. tuberculosis by PCR. The QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus (QFT) test was negative."
graph_369,True,"A clinical case report focuses on acquired resistance to PD-1 blockade in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). PD-1 blockade is now a routine treatment for nearly all patients with NSCLC. Acquired resistance to PD-1 blockade is defined as an initial response to the treatment followed later by disease progression. This phenomenon is common but poorly understood. The case report highlights the lack of standard guidance for clinical management when acquired resistance is suspected. The infrequency of tumor biopsies and the uncertainty of actionability from tissue sampling contribute to limited insight into the biology of acquired resistance. To address this knowledge gap and to highlight the value of tumor and liquid biopsy, the report presents a representative case of suspected acquired resistance to PD-1 blockade and proposes a multi-modal guide for approaching this clinical scenario.

graph_372,True,"The pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 is a serious global challenge affecting millions of people worldwide. Cancer patients are at risk for infection exposure and serious complications. A prompt diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial for the timely adoption of isolation measures and the appropriate management of cancer treatments. In lung cancer patients the symptoms of infection may resemble those exhibited by the underlying oncologic condition, possibly leading to diagnostic overlap and delays. Moreover, cancer patients might display a prolonged positivity of nasopharyngeal RT-PCR assays for SARS-CoV-2, causing long interruptions or delay of cancer treatments.

We describe the case of a patient with non-small cell lung cancer, and a severe ab extrinseco compression of the trachea, whose palliative radiotherapy was delayed because of the prolonged positivity of nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2. The patient did not show clinical symptoms suggestive of active infection, but the persistent positivity of RT-PCR assays imposed the continuation of isolation measures and the delay of radiotherapy for over two months. Finally, the negative result of SARS-CoV-2 viral culture allowed us to verify the absence of viral activity and to rule out the infectivity of the patient, who could finally continue her cancer treatment.

Radical surgical resection of early non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the preferred local treatment method. For locally advanced lung cancer, there are many treatment options for resectable stage III NSCLC; however, there is considerable controversy concerning the best treatment mode. The 5-year overall survival (OS) rates for IIIA, IIIB and IIIC were 36%, 26%, and 13% respectively. Relevant studies have shown that neoadjuvant + surgery + adjuvant therapy may yield the longest OS in patients with advanced NSCLC, and in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines on resectable stage III NSCLC, all recommendations indicate neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy + surgery + postoperative adjuvant therapy.

The 2010 and 2014 NSCLC meta-analysis cooperative group studies established the status of neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy. Previous studies have shown that neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy can improve the 5-year survival rate of patients with NSCLC, but only by about 5%, with limited benefit and high toxicity. In contrast, immunotherapy has shown significant efficacy in advanced NSCLC. Related studies have shown that immunotherapy can significantly extend the OS and progression-free survival (PFS) of patients. But the benefits of neoadjuvant immunotherapy are still being examined.

A persistent rise in eosinophils was noted in his blood work, which had started during the time he spent in the infirmary, but since it was mild and not associated with an obvious cause, it was dismissed.

Since hospital discharge, the patient experienced a progressive increase in eosinophil count, reaching 40,000 eosinophils/uL. Autoimmune panel showed near-normal sedimentation rate of 30 mm/hour, normal proteinogram and immunoglobulin panel except for elevated IgE of 2."
graph_376,True,"A 66-year-old male with a 40 pack-year smoking history and sporadic alcohol consumption presented to the emergency department with sudden dyspnea. He was diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction Killip III and started on noninvasive ventilation and intravenous furosemide, which resolved the pulmonary congestion and respiratory failure within 48 hours. During this initial admission for acute heart failure, the eosinophil count was noted to be normal but progressively increased.

The patient was later found to have hypereosinophilia, with eosinophil counts reaching 40,000 eosinophils/uL. This prompted an investigation into the underlying cause, despite the patient being asymptomatic from the hypereosinophilia itself. The initial acute heart failure was attributed to coronary disease and alcohol consumption.

While a treatment course for the underlying cause of hypereosinophilia was being planned, the patient developed new-onset chest pain and was readmitted to the hospital. He was then diagnosed with pulmonary thromboembolism. Subsequently, he developed a lung abscess. Due to these complications, he was not a candidate for chemotherapy. The case highlights the importance of considering uncommon causes of acute heart failure, even in patients with existing cardiovascular risk factors, and maintaining a high degree of suspicion when facing severe analytical disturbances, even in apparently asymptomatic patients. The patient's case was complicated by pulmonary embolism and lung abscess, which precluded chemotherapy.

graph_379,True,"Here's a reconstructed clinical case report based on the provided data:

This article describes two cases of pulmonary inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors (IMTs) in the lungs of adult males. Pulmonary inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors (IMTs) are rarely reported in adult males. Given the low incidence of IMT and the lack of imaging references and pathological guidance, the misdiagnosis rate of IMT is high.

Both patients presented with lesions in the right lobe and a history of pulmonary tuberculosis, along with a long period of refractory intermittent pulmonary inflammation. Both patients experienced intermittent cough symptoms, but pulmonary IMTs were not suspected for a long time.

Prior to the confirmation of IMT, both patients were diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis and treated with either isoniazid (H), rifampin (R), pyrazinamide (Z), and ethambutol (E) (HRZE) or isoniazid (H), levofloxacin (L), pyrazinamide (Z), and ethambutol (E) (HLZE) for months.

In Case 2, imaging revealed multiple subpleural cord signs in the left lung, soft tissue mass shadows at the apex of the right upper lobe, a thickened interlobular interval, and scattered patches and nodules in the upper right lung.

Pathological findings from the lower right lung lesion in both cases revealed a great deal of myofibroblasts, fibroblasts and collagen fibers, accompanied by a large number of plasma cells and foam cell infiltration, which were consistent with the features of IMT.

graph_380,True,"An 81-year-old never-smoker man with a history of nonischemic heart disease, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and dyslipidemia presented with discolored skin lesions on the chest and abdomen. In October 2022, a computed tomography (CT) scan revealed thickening in the retrohilar and paramediastinal regions of the lower right lobe, bilateral pleural effusion, carcinomatous lymphangitis, axillary, mediastinal, and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathies, and a solid pancreatic lesion with infiltration of the spleen and left adrenal gland. After comprehensive evaluation, including skin biopsy and molecular profiling, the patient was diagnosed with enteric-type adenocarcinoma of the lung (lung-ETAC) with a BRAF p.V600E mutation. Lung-ETAC is a rare form of lung cancer with histologic similarities to colorectal cancer, with aggressive behavior and unfavorable prognosis. Treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib initially resulted in positive results, with improvement in skin lesions and overall clinical condition, achieving complete cutaneous response. Nevertheless, approximately 6 months after, the disease had progression with new skin lesions reappearing. This case highlights the potential for targeted therapy in patients with lung-ETAC harboring a BRAF p.V600E mutation.

Biopsy of skin lesions showed enteric-pattern adenocarcinoma with immunohistochemistry positive for CK20, CDX2, CK7, and villin, and negative for TTF1. Gastroscopy and colonoscopy were negative. Molecular profiling revealed BRAF p.V600E mutation and CTNNB1 S45F mutations. Histopathologic examination reveals vascular neoplastic emboli in the dermis of chest skin. The tumor has a solid and cribriform architecture and enteric differentiation being positive for cytokeratin 7, CDX2, and villin.

In November 2022, the patient initiated targeted therapy with dabrafenib (200 mg/d) and trametinib (1.5 mg/d).

After 3 weeks of targeted therapy with dabrafenib and trametinib, objective reduction of skin lesions on the chest and abdomen was observed. The patient experienced G2 rash as a side effect. Clinical conditions gradually improved, and oxygen therapy was no longer required.

After 3 months of targeted therapy with dabrafenib and trametinib, a new skin biopsy revealed a complete response and dermal fibrosis.

After approximately 3 months of treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib, a reevaluation CT scan revealed reduction in size of all known disease sites, with the complete resolution of the skin lesions.

Approximately 6 months after the initiation of treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib, the CT scan revealed a multisite disease progression, along with the onset of novel skin lesions in the chest. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status remained stable.

She denied any tobacco use history or recent sick contacts and had normal preventative cancer screenings regarding mammography and colonoscopy. Respiratory examination demonstrated absent breath sounds over the left lower lung fields.

Initial lab workup revealed a Hemoglobin of 14.9 g/dL and platelets of 314 \u00d7 103/\u03bcL. A complete metabolic panel was unremarkable. N-terminal pro-b-type natriuretic peptide was 64 pg/mL. C-reactive protein was 3.3 mg/L. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was mildly elevated at 30 mm/hour.

Due to persistent respiratory symptoms, a CT scan of the chest was performed, showing a heterogeneous mass-like consolidation in the left upper lobe with left upper and lower lobe bronchi occlusion.

Based on the imaging findings, the patient was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation of the mass-like consolidation.

The patient underwent bronchoscopy, which demonstrated a completely obstructing pearly, white endobronchial lesion within the distal portion of the left mainstem bronchus requiring cryoprobe debulking.

Histological examination from biopsy and eventual resection was notable for residual lipoblasts, with positive fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) testing for MDM2 gene amplification and positive MDM2 immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining.

Further pathological analysis revealed that the tumor stained for desmin but was negative for epithelial markers (cytokeratins). Final pathology demonstrated spindle cell sarcoma corresponding to a dedifferentiated liposarcoma with leiomyosarcomatous differentiation."

Bronchoscopy was performed, and a biopsy was taken from the lung mass. Initial pathology suggested a spindle cell sarcoma with leiomyosarcomatous features. Immunohistochemistry was performed, evaluating for desmin. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was also conducted, revealing murine double minute 2 (MDM2) translocation and MDM2 gene amplification. The final diagnosis was dedifferentiated liposarcoma of the lung, confirmed by the presence of lipoblasts on biopsy.

The patient underwent tumor cryoprobe debulking via bronchoscopy to alleviate the airway obstruction. Surgical intervention, including resection and ultimately pneumonectomy, was performed. Adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy were administered to address potential metastases.

The patient also had a history of menorrhagia and uterine leiomyomata, for which a hysterectomy was performed. Additionally, the patient had a thyroid Hurthle cell neoplasm. The lung mass was initially suspected to be a solitary lung mass or another form of malignancy before the final diagnosis of dedifferentiated liposarcoma was established.

graph_382,True,"Percutaneous osteoplasty (POP) is emerging as a promising procedure for patients with painful bone metastasis who are unsuitable for surgery or who show resistance to radiotherapy and/or analgesic therapies. Bone metastasis is a common condition in patients with cancer, especially in patients with breast, lung, and prostate cancers. The most frequent symptom from bone metastasis is severe pain that can affect the quality of life of patients and usually limits patients’ mobility. Radiation therapy (RT) may be effective for pain relief and is a standard palliative treatment for metastatic bone tumors. Nonetheless, up to 20–30% of patients treated with RT do not respond to the treatment. Once the pain recurs at a previously irradiated site, RT cannot be performed again due to dose limits in normal tissues.

This report describes four patients with sternal metastases who suffered with severe pain of the anterior chest wall. The original tumors included lung cancer and thyroid cancer. The indication for POP in these four patients was that they were nonsurgical candidates due to poor performance status or patient refusal for surgery intervention. They experienced severe bone pain caused by sternal metastatic disease, which severely affected their quality of life, and their pain was unresponsive to conventional therapy, including various analgesics and chemotherapeutic regimens. Pain intensity was assessed using a 10-point numeric rating scale (NRS scores) with values from 0/10 (no pain) to 10/10 (maximum pain intensity).

For rapidly relieving severe bone pain caused by metastases and improving the life quality of those patients, POP was offered as a treatment to the patients with a multi-interdisciplinary consensus among a team of surgeons, oncologists, interventional radiologists, and radiotherapists. All four patients received POP procedure under fluoroscopic and cone-beam CT (CBCT) guidance, and obtained satisfying resolution of painful symptoms at 6-month postop follow-up. POP is a safe and effective treatment for pain caused by metastatic bone tumors in the sternum.

Biopsy of the lung lesion confirmed squamous cell carcinoma. The patient reported pain with a numerical rating scale (NRS) of 9, with no symptom improvement with oral narcotics. Percutaneous osteoplasty (POP) was performed with two punctures at the lesion sites. Two needles were inserted into the lesion successively at a 45° inclination using an inferior to superior approach, and 2.5 mL of cement was injected into the sternal lesion. An immediate post-procedure CT scan demonstrated good cement distribution in the lesion and slight leakage along the posterior cortical margin.

CT scan parameters were: Aquilion PRIME; Canon Medical Systems, Otawara, Japan; 2-mm slice thickness and no interval.

The patient was placed in a supine oblique position. A CT scan of the thorax showed a 22 mm lobulated nodule in the left upper lobe apicoposterior segment. Biopsy was performed following local anesthesia with 2% lidocaine. A 19-gauge introducer needle was inserted and advanced along the planned trajectory. A CT scan was acquired to confirm needle tip location. The inner stylet was removed and replaced by the biopsy needle, which was advanced into the lesion. A sample was acquired, the biopsy needle was removed, and replaced by the stylet. Samples were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. The introducer needle was removed rapidly. The needle tip was located outside the tumor, and specimen acquisition was performed once.

An immediate post-biopsy CT scan of the thorax revealed a 3-mm air-filled cystic lesion in the path of the biopsy needle, suggesting a pneumatocele with extension along the adjacent bronchovascular bundle. Immediate post-PTNB CT images showed a 3-mm-sized, air-filled cystic lesion in the path of the biopsy needle, suggesting a pneumatocele, with extension along the adjacent bronchovascular bundle, accompanied by ground-glass opacity and consolidation due to hemorrhage and minimal ipsilateral pneumothorax. Histological examination of the PTNB revealed pulmonary adenocarcinoma.

Ten days after sampling, the patient underwent chest CT with enhancement for preoperative staging of lung cancer. The CT image obtained 10 days after PTNB showed a well-defined, tubular-shaped, non-enhancing nodule with heterogeneous attenuation in the area where pneumatoceles had been previously observed.

An 18FDG PET/CT obtained 14 days after PTNB showed no hypermetabolism in the nodule, whereas the adjacent tumor showed hypermetabolism (SUVmax, 6.0). The nodules were considered as pneumatoceles filled with hematoma rather than tumor seeding. The patient had no fever, respiratory symptoms, or hemoptysis.

A chest CT before biopsy showed a 24 mm microlobulated contoured nodule with pseudocavitation in the anterior segment of the left upper lobe. The needle tip was located outside the tumor, and specimen acquisition was performed four times.

graph_392,True,"Pulmonary carcinosarcoma (PCS) is a rare type of non-small cell cancer, predominantly affecting middle-aged and older smokers. The diagnosis of PCS is challenging due to the absence of characteristic imaging findings, and preoperative biopsies often fail to reflect the tumor's heterologous nature. Prognostic factors remain undefined, and the overall prognosis is poor with limited therapeutic options.

This case report describes a rare instance of metastatic PCS that was incidentally discovered through imaging and accurately diagnosed following surgical resection. The report further discusses the clinicopathological features, diagnostic tools, genetic theories, prognosis, and therapeutic options associated with this rare cancer.

Pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma (PSC), a rare primary non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), encompasses five subtypes according to the World Health Organization (WHO): pleomorphic carcinoma, spindle cell carcinoma, giant cell carcinoma, pulmonary blastoma, and carcinosarcoma. Carcinosarcoma (CS) is characterized by a biphasic histopathological pattern with malignant epithelial and sarcomatous mesenchymal components. While CS can occur in various organs, pulmonary carcinosarcoma (PCS) presents as a symptomatic mass within the endobronchial tree or as an incidental mass in the peripheral lung parenchyma. Preoperative diagnosis is difficult, as biopsies often reveal only one element of the tumor, leading to misdiagnosis and delayed treatment of these aggressive tumors.

graph_393,True,"**Title:** Different efficacy in the non-small cell lung cancer patient with bilateral synchronous lesions treated with neoadjuvant gefitinib therapy: a case report

**Case Report:**

Gefitinib, the first-generation epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI), has become the standard of care for the first-line of therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with common EGFR mutation. However, the efficacy of preoperative gefitinib therapy in patients with common EGFR mutations remains poorly defined. We describe a NSCLC patient with bilateral synchronous lesions who had a significantly positive response to gefitinib before radical surgical resection. At the time of initial diagnosis, we were unable to confirm whether the two lesions were metastatic or synchronous primary lesions. Accordingly, we performed CT-guided percutaneous left lung biopsy resulting in a diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma with exon 21 L858R point mutation of EGFR, This diagnosis was followed by preoperative gefitinib therapy for 8 weeks leading to a significant reduction in the lesion in the left lower lobe. Then the left lower lobectomy and mediastinal lymphadenectomy were performed. In addition, 3 months following resection of the left lower lobe tumor the patient underwent a right lower lobe wedge resection. This report indicates that NSCLC patient harboring common EGFR mutation accepting the first-generation EGFR-TKI gefitinib as a neoadjuvant targeted therapy option is safe, feasible, and well-tolerated.

The patient underwent tumor resection via median sternotomy, which resulted in incomplete resection due to involvement of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve and left phrenic nerve. A mass in the neck and a nodule in the left upper lobe were also resected.

Pathological examination of the resected tissues led to the diagnosis of thymoma type B2 in the anterior mediastinal tumor. The neck mass and nodule in the left lung were identified as metastases of a previous lung adenocarcinoma, positive for TTF-1 on immunohistostaining. Histopathology of the resected left lung nodule showed papillary growth of tumor cells positive for TTF-1.

Further characterization of the lung cancer revealed high PD-L1 expression (tumor progression score of 100%). The tumor was negative for mutations of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), and c-ros oncogene 1 (ROS1).

Postoperative radiation therapy for residual thymic tumors was not performed. The relapsed lung cancer was treated with pembrolizumab, carboplatin, and pemetrexed.

These findings led to a CT scan, which revealed a 3.5-cm anterior left upper lobe (LUL) consolidation and near-complete left lung atelectasis, with pleural effusion. CT scan findings prompted thoracentesis to evaluate the pleural effusion. A thoracentesis of 2,500 mL of pleural fluid was performed, and a sample sent for microbiologic and cytologic analysis. The fluid was exudative. Thoracentesis fluid was sent for analysis. Cultures were negative for acid-fast bacilli, fungi, and anaerobic organisms. Cytology was negative for malignant cells. Negative cultures and cytology results led to discharge with azithromycin for possible community-acquired pneumonia and instructions to return for follow-up with a pulmonologist. Follow-up with pulmonologist led to 18F-FDG PET-CT scan, which identified an FDG-avid LUL mass, mediastinal and bilateral hilar adenopathy, and an intracardiac focus of FDG avidity.

Her Karnofsky performance scale (KPS) score was 60. Contrast-enhanced (CE) MRI of the brain revealed 15 enhancing lesions, including a large cerebellar lesion (≥3.8 cm, 17.7 cm3), all indicative of brain metastases (BMs). CE-T1-weighted images (CE-T1-WIs) showed a well-demarcated lesion with the dominance of the peripheral enhancement (3.8 cm in the maximum diameter, 17.7 cm3 in the volume). The lesion was observed as a heterogeneous intensity mass associated with mild perilesional edema on T2-WI. The lesion reached the cerebellar surface at the ventrolateral and caudal sides and appeared to extend beyond it in some areas. In the ipsilateral hemisphere, a 1.1 cm solid lesion (0.8 cm3) was located adjacent to the 3.8 cm lesion, and a 0.9 cm lesion (0.3 cm3) was located less than 1 cm away from the 3.8 cm lesion.

graph_401,False,"A 52-year-old man presented in December 2022 with a two-month history of swelling and pain in the right testis. His medical history included hypertension, which was well-controlled. He reported no known exposure to asbestos.

A pre-admission CT scan revealed significant hydrocele of the right testicular tunica vaginalis, suggesting epididymitis. B-ultrasound confirmed a cyst in the right epididymis head and significant hydrocele in the right testicle. Tumor markers were within normal limits.

Based on these findings, the patient underwent right testicular sheath reversal and right testicular sheath lesion resection under general anesthesia.

Postoperative pathological microscopic observations revealed two distinct forms of cells, epithelial and sarcomatoid, with reciprocal migration between the two. The epithelial components were characterized by small tubular, papillary, and solid arrangements.

The pathology report described tumor cells that were cubic, flattened, or low-columnar in shape, with eosinophilic cytoplasm and round nuclei containing visible nucleoli. The sarcomas were comprised of spindle-shaped cell clusters arranged in bundles or mats with spindle-shaped nuclei and visible nucleoli. Immunohistochemical staining showed the following results: Calretinin(+), carcinoembryonic antigen(\u2212), cytokeratin (CK)5/6(+), D2-40(+), Wilms' tumor 1 (WT-1)(+), human bone marrow endothelial cell marker-1(+), Gata-3(+), vimentin(+),desmin+), Ki-67(10%+), CD15(\u2212), CD34(\u2212), and smooth muscle actin(+). The pathological diagnosis was biphasic mesothelioma.

The patient recovered well postoperatively and was discharged seven days after admission.

In March 2023, the patient was readmitted for right orchiectomy.

Postoperative pathology of the testicular (right) and partial scrotal resection specimens below the skin, testis, and epididymis revealed fibrous tissue hyperplasia, lymphocyte infiltration, and a large number of foreign body giant cell aggregates and line knot reactions.

Postoperative assessment revealed no definite tumor residue, consistent with changes after tumor resection. The spermatic margin was negative. The patient had a long history of hydrocele.

The patient recovered well after surgery and was closely followed up. He was followed up once, and no abnormalities were observed."
graph_401,True,"A rare case of malignant mesothelioma of the tunica vaginalis testis is presented. Malignant mesothelioma of the tunica vaginalis testis is a rare, highly invasive urogenital malignant tumor with no specific clinical manifestations. Reported cases of this disease are limited, making early preoperative diagnosis difficult.

A 52-year-old man was admitted to Xiaoshan Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University (Hangzhou, China) in December 2022. He underwent radical resection of the right testicle and epididymis. Postoperatively, he did not undergo radiotherapy or chemotherapy. The patient was followed up for 5 months, and no recurrence or metastasis was found.

Malignant mesothelioma of the tunica vaginalis testis is a rare tumor that accounts for <1% of all mesothelioma cases. It can occur at any age; however, the majority of patients are between 55 and 75 years of age, with occasional cases in adolescents. Since its first recording in 1957, <300 cases have been reported worldwide. The most common clinical manifestation of this disease is scrotal enlargement with an unexplained hydrocele; a small number of patients present with internal scrotal masses and pain in the inguinal area.

graph_403,False,"A 71-year-old male presented for a routine prostate gland consultation and was found to have a large hydrocele on clinical examination. Testicular ultrasound showed a right hydrocele with echogenic material, indicating chronicity, and a 3 cm heterogeneous, hyper-vascularized testicular tumor on the antero-inferior wall. The contralateral testis was normal.

The patient's history included 20 pack-years of smoking, arterial hypertension, sleep apnea syndrome treated by CPAP since the age of 55, primary tuberculous infection in childhood with a sequelae of pulmonary subpleural nodule, idiopathic sideroblastic anemia under erythropoietin since 2012, treated hypothyroidism, and dyslipidemia. Thoracic auscultation was normal. Tumor markers HCG and α-FP were normal. Thoraco-abdomino-pelvic CT showed no metastasis.

Surgical exploration revealed many hard and fleshy nodules on the testicular vaginalis. A radical orchidectomy was performed without lymph node excision. Histology noted a malignant mesothelioma of epithelioid type consisting of papillary and tubular structures. The tumor expressed the typical mesothelial markers of Calretinin, CK 5/6 and WT1.

Postoperative PET-CT showed no metastasis. The patient was followed with PET-CT every three months without further treatment.

Twenty-four months after initial treatment, CT showed a 14 mm lower mediastinal lymphadenopathy, which was hypermetabolic (SUV max at 8.7) on PET."
graph_404,True,"A 72-year-old male was referred to our hospital complaining of progressive dysphagia for two years. The patient had a history of hypertension for several years. Endoscopy revealed a 2 cm long segment esophageal stenosis with intact mucosa and normal cardia. Computed tomography showed a right upper lung mass, and pathology of the right pleural effusion confirmed the diagnosis of right upper lung adenocarcinoma with multiple rib and mediastinal lymph node metastases and right malignant pleural effusion. The final diagnosis was changed to esophageal muscle metastasis arising from lung adenocarcinoma. Obviously, for the palliative treatment of benign or malignant esophageal strictures, flexible self-expanding metal (SEMS) can effectively provide rapid relief of dysphagia. Peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) has been widely performed as a standard treatment for achalasia; however, its efficacy and safety for treating distal esophageal segmental spasms induced by cancer metastasis remain unknown.

graph_404,False,"A 72-year-old male presented with progressive dysphagia, retrosternal pain, intermittent cough, and significant weight loss over two years, worsening in the last month. These symptoms led to a chest CT on July 4, 2022, which revealed a right upper lung mass and right pleural effusion. Imaging findings prompted a right pleural puncture, and pathological analysis confirmed lung adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemical staining showed positive expression of cytokeratin (CK) 7, carcinoembryonic antigen, and thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1). Further molecular testing via next-generation sequencing detected PIK3CA mutations. Endoscopy reports from a local hospital led to a suspected diagnosis of jackhammer esophagus, based on an esophageal high-resolution manometry report, low resting pressure of the upper esophagus sphincter, normal pressure of the lower esophagus sphincter, and locally increased pressure in the middle and lower esophagus without normal peristalsis (Chicago classification II and III).

The patient had been suffering from hypertension for several years. Mild tenderness in the right chest was identified by palpation. Lab tests revealed a carcinoembryonic antigen level of 5.42 ng/mL and a neuron-specific enolase level of 19.22 ng/mL. An esophagogram revealed grade I dilation of the esophageal lumen, segmental stenosis of the distal esophagus, and delayed emptying of barium contrast agent from the esophagus. Endoscopy revealed a 2 cm long segment of concentric esophageal stenosis 35–37 cm away from the incisors, with apparently normal overlying mucosa. The cardia had normal contraction and relaxation. Serum albumin level changed from below 40 g/L pre-POEM to above 40 g/L post-POEM.

CT imaging revealed abnormality of the right 9th and 10th ribs and enlargement of mediastinal lymph nodes. Thickening of the wall in the lower esophagus far from the lung space-occupying lesion was also observed. The patient was diagnosed with right upper lung adenocarcinoma with multiple rib and mediastinal lymph node metastases and right malignant pleural effusion, clinically staged as cT1bN0M1c, IVB. Post-POEM diagnosis confirmed esophageal muscle metastasis arising from lung adenocarcinoma. An individualized POEM procedure was performed on July 14, 2022, to alleviate dysphagia before chemotherapy. Submucosal injection was performed at the level of the middle esophagus, 5 cm proximal to the level of stenosis. A longitudinal tunnel was created until the level of the stenosis was reached. Inner circular myotomy of the esophagus was performed to expand the tunnel space, beginning 3 cm distal to the mucosal entry."
graph_405,True,"A rare case of combined small cell lung cancer (CSCLC) with adenocarcinoma was reported in an elderly patient. CSCLC is defined as cancer tissues mainly containing small cell lung cancer (SCLC) components with non-SCLC (NSCLC) histopathological types. While the most common NSCLC components are squamous cell carcinoma or large cell carcinoma, CSCLC containing adenocarcinoma is extremely rare.

The patient was surgically treated and diagnosed with CSCLC with adenocarcinoma. The patient remained well for over 2 weeks after the treatment.

During the procedure, after the lesion was cut off, biopsy forceps were used to remove tissue from the mass for rapid freezing pathology. The pathological diagnosis confirmed small cell lung cancer combined with adenocarcinoma.

A review of the literature revealed only 15 reported cases of pulmonary SCLC combined with adenocarcinoma, including the present case. The ratio of male to female patients was 4:1, and the mean age was 68 years.

Histopathologically, the tumor lesion was composed of two distinct parts, clearly defined under the microscope. The SCLC component consisted of small, uniform, poorly differentiated necrotic cancers. The other half was adenocarcinoma with papillary and acinar features.

Genetic analysis, including loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis, has been performed in some cases of CSCLC. Studies suggest that the small cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma components in CSCLC are clone-related, but the adenocarcinoma component may come from a single clone and has no obvious correlation with small cell carcinoma.

MRI demonstrated new, symmetrical contrast-enhancing foci at the expected location of the facial nerves, consistent with leptomeningeal progression. Erlotinib was ceased and osimertinib was commenced. Facial nerve motor and sensory function began to improve within 1 week and by 2 weeks had returned to near normal. Review at 2 and 6 months demonstrated normal facial nerve function and progressive resolution of the facial nerve lesions on MRI. While rare, leptomeningeal malignancy may present as simultaneous bilateral facial nerve palsies. Osimertinib has superior central nervous system penetration and in this case was associated with rapid and sustained clinical and radiographical resolution of the facial nerve lesions.

He proceeded with a CT-guided biopsy of the lung mass which on histopathology revealed necrotic material.

On presentation, the patient had a respiratory rate of 18 per minute, and impaired percussion note along with decreased intensity of breath sounds over the left upper hemithorax. He also presented with non-productive cough and dyspnoea and was evaluated and diagnosed to have a left lung mass on CT of the chest.

A transthoracic needle biopsy under CT guidance revealed necrotic tissue on histopathology and was inconclusive. Positron emission tomography scan revealed a fluoro-deoxyglucose-avid left lung mass with a left upper lobe luminal cut-off. The PET-CT revealed a fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG)-avid left lingular lung mass measuring 89×88×71 mL with maximum standardised uptake value (SUVmax) of 14.35, and an FDG avid intraluminal plug (SUVmax 8.13) within the left upper lobe bronchus, with enlarged FDG avid subcarinal lymph node and complete lingular collapse.

One month prior to presentation, a chest skiagram and CT of the chest performed at an outside hospital revealed a left lung mass.

Further investigation included a CT-guided biopsy of the lung mass, which revealed necrotic material, prompting a PET scan. Clinical examination revealed a respiratory rate of 18 per minute, and impaired percussion note along with decreased intensity of breath sounds over the left upper hemithorax. Laboratory investigations revealed a haemoglobin of 116 g/L (normal range 130–170 g/L), and total cell counts of 10.9 × 109/L (normal 4–11×109/L) with a differential of 60% polymorphs, 18.7% lymphocytes, 11.9% eosinophils and 8.6% monocytes.

Bronchoscopy revealed an endoluminal plug with jelly-like consistency completely occluding the left upper lobe bronchus. The left upper lobe lumen was cleared using a combination of biopsy forceps and snare, and a lingular growth was identified from which a biopsy was taken. Histopathology revealed necrotic fragments with colonisation of fungal organisms morphologically resembling Aspergillus, along with infiltration of the subepithelium with atypical cells. By immunohistochemistry, the latter cells were positive for vimentin and thyroid transcription factor-1, and were negative for EBV-LMP1, p63, synaptophysin and chromogranin, favouring a diagnosis of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of lung."
graph_415,True,"A 50-year-old Japanese woman with no history of asbestos exposure or smoking developed malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) 25 years after receiving thoracic radiation therapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma. At age 25, she had undergone chemotherapy with mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisolone, along with radiation therapy. The irradiated lesions were localized in the mediastinum (50 Gray/25 fractions) and abdomen (56 Gray/28 fractions) as the primary and recurrence sites, respectively.

Five years after the radiation therapy, chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a small amount of left pleural effusion. Due to the small volume, thoracentesis was not performed, and follow-up with chest CT and X-ray was continued, considering radiation pleuritis. The pleural effusion and thickness increased after 20 years of follow-up, prompting her to seek evaluation at the reporting hospital.

This case is reported as the first in Japan of MPM developing in a long-term survivor of a primary malignancy with a history of thoracic radiation therapy. The patient's lack of asbestos exposure suggests that the radiation therapy was the likely cause of the MPM. The report emphasizes the need for long-term follow-up after thoracic radiation therapy to monitor for secondary malignancies, including MPM, especially with advancements in radiation treatment leading to improved long-term survival.

The pleural effusion was too small to perform thoracentesis, and the patient was monitored with chest CT and X-ray, with radiation pleuritis considered as a possible cause. After 20 years of follow-up, the pleural effusion and thickness increased. The patient visited the hospital for an evaluation, and no pleural calcifications were noted. Positron emission tomography revealed 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in the thickening pleura. A full-thickness pleural biopsy showed tubule-papillary components in the pleura. Immunohistochemistry showed positive staining for calretinin, D2-40, and CK5/6 and negative staining for CEA and p40, leading to a diagnosis of epithelial type of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). A chest contrast-enhanced CT a year before the first visit to the hospital revealed a small amount of pleural effusion. FDG-PET a year before the first visit to the hospital revealed no FDG uptake. No asbestos bodies were found. FDG-PET at the first visit to the hospital revealed an FDG uptake in the left pleural cavity.

Her comorbidities included grand mal epilepsy, stage II hypertension, hypertensive heart disease with preserved ejection fraction, grade I obesity, hysterectomy in 2001 for uteroplacental apoplexy, and surgically induced menopause at age 34. She presented with progressive dyspnea (mMRC score 2), right posterior chest pain radiating to the anterior chest, and intermittent low-grade fever (37.2°C to 38°C).

The patient presented to the emergency department, and a chest X-ray revealed changes suggestive of a moderate right pleural effusion. Antibiotic and symptomatic treatment was initiated. A chest CT scan confirmed a significant right pleural effusion, fused at the level of the oblique fissure causing passive collapse of the subpleural lung parenchyma.

Due to the significant right pleural effusion, the patient was referred to clinic and directed to local pneumology service. Further diagnostic workup was pursued, including right thoracentesis, draining approximately 600 ml of serous fluid with biochemical characteristics of exudate and cytology showing atypical cells suggestive of malignancy. A right pleural biopsy was non-diagnostic due to chronic inflammatory changes. Labs showed elevated ESR (60 mm/h) and platelet count (451.000 103/μL), and low creatinine (0.39 mg/dL). Other lab values included: Hemoglobin 12.70 g/dL, Hematocrit 38.90%, Total leukocyte count 8.01 103/μL, Lymphocyte % 31.70, Monocyte % 4.9, Eosinophils % 3, Basophil % 0.90, Urea 23 mg/dL, AST 18 U/L, ALT 25 U/L, and Fibrinogen 429 mg/dL.

Fiberoptic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage was performed to further investigate the cause of the pleural effusion. Results showed a normal larynx, diffuse bronchitis, and no evidence of pathogenic organisms. Microbiological tests for non-specific flora, mycology, and Ziehl-Neelsen staining showed no evidence of pathogenic organisms.

graph_416,True,"We present the clinical case of a 58-year-old female patient, a smoker with a 15-pack-year history and 15 years of occupational exposure to respiratory toxins from working in the tobacco industry. She also had multiple comorbidities, including grand mal epilepsy, stage II hypertension, hypertensive heart disease with preserved ejection fraction, grade I obesity, a hysterectomy in 2001 for uteroplacental apoplexy, and surgically induced menopause at age 34.

The patient was admitted to our clinic following evaluation in an emergency department, where she was diagnosed with a moderate right pleural effusion. Upon admission, the patient exhibited respiratory symptoms, including progressive dyspnea with a moderate exertion threshold, right posterior pleuritic chest pain radiating anteriorly, occasional episodes of low-grade fever, and persistent febrile symptoms lasting approximately two weeks.

In this clinical context, the diagnostic process was guided by the presence of right pleural effusion syndrome, which was refractory to conservative medical therapy. This necessitated a careful and stepwise expansion of investigations, ultimately leading to the diagnosis of malignant pleural mesothelioma.

This case underscores the diagnostic challenges posed by pleural effusion, the necessity of adhering to the diagnostic algorithm, and the critical role of the multidisciplinary team. MPM is notoriously challenging to diagnose early, as initial symptoms like chest pain, dyspnea, and pleural effusions are often nonspecific and mimic other pulmonary conditions.

Standard therapies include surgery, such as pleurectomy/decortication or extrapleural pneumonectomy, combined with chemotherapy (often pemetrexed and cisplatin) and radiation therapy.

graph_420,True,"Cancer is a global public health concern and the second leading cause of death worldwide. The cancer burden continues to grow globally, with many cancer patients lacking access to timely, quality diagnosis and treatment. South Africa is experiencing a quadruple burden of disease, including an increase in non-communicable diseases (NCDs), to which cancer contributes greatly. It is estimated that 1 in 7 women and 1 in 6 men are at risk of developing cancer in their lifetime. The observed increase in cancer burden is attributable to increasing aging, population growth, and increased prevalence of risk factors associated with economic transition, such as smoking, obesity, physical inactivity, reproductive behaviors, and westernized diets.

A retrospective survey was conducted using the database of Frere Hospital Oncology-Radiation Unit to study cancer in the Buffalo City (BFC) population, Eastern Cape (EC) Province, for the period 1991-2009. The study calculated the top cancer sites and identified the two most common cancers in males and females. The most common cancers among women are breast, cervix, colorectal, uterus and lung. The reported common cancers among men are prostate, colorectal, lung, bladder and oesophagus.

The study found that lung and prostate cancers decreased in males, while cervical and breast cancers remained stable in females. Black Africans with lung cancer were five times more likely to have prostate cancer (95% CI: 3.90-6.21). Black Africans with cervical cancer were three times more likely to have breast cancer (95% CI: 2.45-3.14).

The routine cancer data collected at Frere Hospital contributes to strengthening the national cancer notification regulation. However, the burden of cancer in the EC Province remains high. Lung, prostate, colorectal, stomach and liver cancers are the most common types in men, while breast, colorectal, lung, cervical and thyroid cancers are the most common among women.

Pleural effusion cytology revealed large epithelioid cells with mild nuclear atypia, which were considered reactive mesothelial cells. These cells harbored variously sized intracytoplasmic vacuoles that were Alcian-blue-positive, suggesting hyaluronan production. Computed tomography revealed diffuse multinodular or cystic lesions in the left parietal pleura. Biopsy revealed large epithelioid cells that loosely proliferated against a prominent myxoid background. FISH showed homozygous deletion of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (p16) on chromosome 9p21. Electron-microscopy demonstrated a dense microvillus pattern on the surface of the tumor cells, indicating a mesothelial cell origin, and variously sized vacuoles in the cytoplasm, confirming the presence of intracytoplasmic vacuoles demonstrated on cytology. BAP1-immunohistochemistry revealed nuclear negativity in tumor cells. Based on these findings, the lesion was diagnosed as an epithelioid mesothelioma with a prominent myxoid stroma. The histological diagnosis was malignant mesothelioma of the myxoid variant according to the WHO classification system (2015, 4th edition). The tumor tissues obtained during surgery harbored prominent myxoid stroma, which proved that the present tumor was consistent with this type of mesothelioma.

Eight months prior, he was diagnosed with oligometastatic adenocarcinoma in the right lung with a solitary brain metastasis (cT2aN0M1b). Next generation sequencing revealed a TP53 mutation. Fluorescence in situ hybridization for ALK was negative, but immunohistochemistry for PD-L1 was 100% positive.

Initially, the cerebral lesion was surgically resected, followed by stereotactic radiotherapy (5 × 7 Gy) at the resection site. The primary tumor was surgically removed by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) with inferior right lobectomy. Four cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy (cisplatin–pemetrexed combination) were administered.

At the end of adjuvant treatment, disease progression was noted with new pleural metastasis and a suspected pancreatic lesion. Pembrolizumab (2 mg/kg) in a 3-weekly cycle was started as second-line treatment.

Three weeks after the first cycle of pembrolizumab, the patient consulted, presenting with dyspnea, pain in the right calf muscle, swelling of the lower limbs, and inability to walk for 2 days. He also reported growing general discomfort, fatigue, and bilateral weakness of the legs with exercise limitation since the first pembrolizumab administration. Clinical examination confirmed swelling of the lower legs, right more than left, with pain in the right calf.

Auscultation of heart and lungs was normal. Vital parameters were normal. Blood tests revealed elevated creatine kinase (CK) 11796 U/l (ref. <190 U/l), elevated CK cardiac isoenzyme 112.5 μg/l (ref. <6.2 μg/l), and troponin 0.183 μg/l (ref. <0.013 μg/l). Liver function enzymes and LDH were also disrupted, and c-reactive protein was increased to 35 mg/l. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus rhythm with new small biphasic T-waves in V2 to V5.

CT of the chest showed no pulmonary embolism or other causes of dyspnea. Venous duplex scan of the lower limbs showed no venous thrombosis in the pelvis or legs. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed a normotrophic and normocontractile heart with normal systolic left and right ventricular function, without significant valvular disease.

From July 20 until September 21, 2009, three cycles of full-dose paclitaxel + cisplatin were administered and then discontinued because of grade III sensory neuropathy by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). Follow-up chest CT showed partial remission. Gradual improvement of the sensory neuropathy down to CTCAE grade I was noted. Chest CT on July 7, 2012, revealed complete regression of the lung ADC with fibrotic changes. In April 2013, the patient developed bilateral leg weakness resulting from spinal cord compression. Spinal cord compression at thoracic-12 level from SCCT was successfully relieved with neurosurgical treatment, chemotherapy with etoposide and cisplatin, and radiotherapy, while gefitinib treatment was maintained. A course of IMRT with 30 Gy/10 fractions/13 days was administered to the T-11 to L1 spinal metastases from April 25 to May 7, 2013. Complete remission occurred with no tumor activity, normal lactate dehydrogenase level, and improving performance status. On March 26, 2014, a subcentimeter nodule was noted in the right upper lung lobe. Eleven months later, SCCT relapsed in the lung parenchyma, which was resected and was found to be sensitive to second-line weekly topotecan.

Subsequently, he was treated with pembrolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel as second-line therapy and soon developed neurological symptoms. He was then diagnosed with leptomeningeal metastasis (LM) based on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology. A rebiopsy of lung tissue revealed an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) sensitive mutation. The patient was initially treated with high-dose (160mg) osimertinib, but he could not tolerate the severe neurological symptoms and developed a cardiac adverse event. The treatment was then changed to standard-dose (80mg) osimertinib plus anlotinib, which resulted in the alleviation of his neurological symptoms.

Imaging and cytological findings pointed toward a likely primary right parotid malignancy with liver metastases, suggesting metastatic parotid acinic cell carcinoma (ACC). The patient underwent right parotidectomy, and histopathologic examination confirmed ACC. Meanwhile, hypercortisolism was managed with metyrapone and ketoconazole.

Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) ectopic production is a rare cause of Cushing syndrome (CS). The most commonly associated tumors are small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) along with bronchial and thymic carcinoids. To date, only 5 cases have been published in the literature featuring ectopic ACTH secretion from metastatic acinic cell carcinoma (ACC) of the parotid gland.

graph_431,False,"A 38-year-old male, a heavy smoker, presented with a 3-day history of colicky right-sided and epigastric abdominal pain. The pain increased with eating, was not relieved by H2 blockers, but was partially relieved by Ibuprofen. He also reported abdominal distension, sweating, nausea, and vomiting of clear fluid without blood. Accompanying these symptoms were generalized fatigue, a feverish sensation, anorexia, and recent weight loss. The patient also developed dyspnea and a cough without hemoptysis. Physical examination revealed diffuse tenderness and guarding of the abdomen, more prominent in the right upper and lower quadrants, along with rebound tenderness.

An initial chest X-ray showed retrocardiac consolidation of the right lower lobe of the lung, enlargement of the cardiac outline with a water bottle sign suggesting pericardial effusion, and obliteration of the right costophrenic angle denoting moderate right-sided pleural effusion.

These chest X-ray findings prompted further investigation with a chest and abdominal CT scan with intravenous contrast, which revealed ascites, a right lower lobe lesion suggesting consolidation, and associated pleural and pericardial effusion.

The CT scan findings of pericardial effusion led to echocardiography, which detected a large pericardial effusion with significant right ventricular compression and normal left ventricular size and function.

Detection of ascites on the CT scan prompted abdominocentesis. The fluid obtained was yellow and turbid, with increased lactate dehydrogenase, normal glucose, total protein, and albumin.

The abdominocentesis results and pleural effusion findings led to pleural fluid analysis and pericardiocentesis. Pleural fluid analysis showed: Glucose 105 mg/dL, LDH 112 U/L (increased), Total protein 2.7 g/dL, Albumin 1.8 g/dL, indicating an exudative fluid. Pericardiocentesis showed a bloody, turbid aspirate. Cultures of the pleural, pericardial, and peritoneal fluid samples showed no evidence of bacterial or fungal growth. Peritoneal fluid analysis showed: Glucose 108 mg/dL, LDH 121 U/L (increased), Total protein 3.7 g/dL, Albumin 2.4 g/dL. Pericardial fluid analysis showed: Glucose 37 mg/dL (decreased), LDH 1156 U/L (increased), Total protein 5.2 g/dL (increased), Albumin 3.3 g/dL. Serum values were: Glucose 106 mg/dL, LDH 168 U/L (decreased), Total protein 6.1 g/dL, Albumin 3.9 g/dL.

Pleural and pericardial fluid analysis prompted further analysis including cytology and a pericardial window. Cytology of the peritoneal fluid showed macrophages, neutrophils, and occasional lymphocytes with reactive mesothelial cells and was negative for malignancy. Cytology of the right pleural fluid revealed few reactive mesothelial cells, many lymphocytes, few neutrophils, and the absence of cancer cells. A pericardial window under echocardiography-guidance illustrated mild chronic inflammation with no evidence of malignancy.

Based on initial findings, the patient was started on colchicine, ibuprofen, metronidazole, and levofloxacin.

Following treatment, a follow-up CT scan revealed resolution of almost all of the pleural effusion, with significant reduction of pericardial effusion but persistence of a spiculated soft tissue enhancing lesion measuring about 2.1 cm in the right lower lobe associated with hilar and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. A chest CT scan showed a spiculated mass in the right lower lobe of the lung. A neck CT scan showed an enlarged left supraclavicular lymph node. A whole-body positron emission tomography scan demonstrated a hypermetabolic potentially malignant right pulmonary nodule in the posterior basal segment of the lower lobe, bilateral prominent-sized."
graph_431,True,"We report a case of a 38-year-old male patient who presented with polyserous effusions and pneumonia. He was treated accordingly and showed clinical improvement with a significant reduction of pericardial and pleural effusions. However, any polyserous effusions at a young age must always be suspicious for malignancy. Subsequent testing and a biopsy resulted in the histopathological diagnosis of an adenocarcinoma of the lung. This case highlights the diagnostic challenges posed by atypical presentations of lung adenocarcinoma and emphasizes the importance of considering malignancy in the differential diagnosis of polyserous effusions, even when initial cytology results are negative. Clinicians should remain vigilant for false-negative results, especially in younger patients. Nonrecurrent polyserous effusions in lung adenocarcinoma are uncommon, and negative cytology results may not exclude malignancy due to the moderate sensitivity of pleural and pericardial fluid cytology. The coexistence of lung cancer and polyserous effusions is uncommon, which may cause a diagnostic challenge. Due to the difficulty in differentiating lung adenocarcinoma from pneumonia when it presents as parenchymal consolidation, diagnosis of the condition is frequently delayed.

A CT scan was performed to evaluate the pulmonary nodules, suggesting a 3.3 x 2.4 cm solid nodule in the upper lobe of the left lung. The patient then underwent video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) with left upper lobectomy and lymph node dissection, followed by post-surgical follow-up and management."
graph_435,False,"A 75-year-old male presented with a 5-month history of recurrent coughing, expectoration, and panting, with symptoms worsening over the past month. Initially, the patient coughed up white frothy sputum. A chest CT scan revealed bilateral diffuse lesions and a nodular shadow in the left lower lobe. The patient was treated with intravenous piperacillin sulbactam (4.5g, Q8h), which resulted in symptom relief.

A follow-up chest CT on January 19, 2020, indicated a special infectious lesion and a nodular shadow in the back of the left lower lobe. A repeat chest CT on January 26, 2020, showed worsening opacity in both lungs, diffuse lesions in both lungs, scattered ground glass nodes in both lungs, and a nodular shadow in the posterior segment of the upper lobe of the left lung. The patient refused invasive tracheoscopy examination or biopsy.

A subsequent chest CT reexamination on April 24, 2020, indicated diffuse lesions of both lungs, a special pathological bacterial infection lesion, and scattered ground glass nodes with a withered shape in both lungs. Compared to the January 26, 2020, scan, the foci had increased significantly. A final chest CT reexamination on May 14, 2020, indicated diffuse lesions of both lungs and the special pathological bacterial infection lesion that needed to be checked.

graph_437,True,"Sarcoidosis detected after COVID‑19 with T‑SPOT.TB positive: A case report.

Sarcoidosis is an idiopathic multisystem disorder with unknown etiology. It is characterized by the presence of non-caseating epithelioid cell granulomas. Due to clinical similarities among sarcoidosis, tuberculosis (TB) infection and malignant diseases (such as lymphoma, lung carcinoma and pituitary tumor), the diagnosis can be challenging.

This report describes a case who presented with multiple lymphadenopathies throughout the body after COVID-19 and was T-SPOT.TB positive, but without lung parenchyma involvement. The patient was diagnosed with sarcoidosis manifesting as multiple lymphadenopathies. Considering the clinical features, disease history and the pathological examination results of the patient, there were no concrete elements supporting cancer, therefore sarcoidosis was deemed the most likely diagnosis.

This case report aims to suggest a possible connection between COVID-19 and sarcoidosis, and provide insights to sarcoidosis diagnosis. Tana et al proposed that there may be a link between COVID-19 and sarcoidosis, since they have similar clinical manifestations and may influence each other at multiple levels, eventually affecting their clinical courses and prognosis. Some patients with SARS-CoV-2 developed subcutaneous nodules with granulomatous histology similar to sarcoidosis.

The patient was later diagnosed with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and Stage IV Refractory NSCLC. The case report describes long-term therapy management based on iterative de novo molecular and cellular analysis. Temporal tumor evolution, emergent therapy resistance, and disease recurrences were addressed via the administration of personalized label- and organ-agnostic treatments based on de novo tumor profiling. This adaptive and iterative treatment strategy countered disease progression at each instance and led to the durable regression of primary as well as metastatic lesions. Concurrently, serial evaluation of mutations in cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) via liquid biopsy (LBx) was performed to monitor disease status, ascertain treatment response, identify emergent drug resistance, and detect recurrence at sub-radiological levels.

A 68-year-old woman with a history of Crohn's disease (CD) was referred to our hospital due to a one-month history of right-sided back pain. The patient denied experiencing pharyngeal pain, hoarseness, cough, sputum production, wheezing, or dyspnea. She had a smoking history of 22 pack-years.

Nine years prior to this presentation, the patient had been diagnosed with CD based on clinical, endoscopic, and histological evidence. Over the past several years, she had experienced two recurrent episodes of CD. During the second recurrence, colonoscopy revealed discontinuous mucosal ulceration in the transverse colon, sigmoid colon, and rectum. A ""cobblestone"" appearance was observed in the sigmoid colon. Pathological findings from the colonic specimen revealed a micro-abscess and cryptitis, supporting the diagnosis of CD. Since then, she had been managed with nutritional therapy, mesalazine (4000 mg/day), and adalimumab (80mg every 2 weeks), resulting in well-controlled gastrointestinal conditions for the previous 3 years.

Physical examination revealed a body temperature of 36.6 °C, and auscultation did not reveal any crackles. There were no cutaneous eruptions, and neurological examinations were negative.

Computed tomography (CT) of the chest demonstrated subpleural nodular consolidation (40 mm in diameter) invading the chest wall, along with two additional nodules (6mm and 8mm in diameter, respectively) in the right upper lobe. A cavitary nodule (21mm in diameter) was also noted in the left lower lobe. These findings raised suspicion for lung cancer.

During the evaluation for suspected lung cancer, bronchoscopy revealed swelling of the epiglottis with edematous changes and a mass-like epiglottis fold. Nodular and edematous changes were also observed in the trachea and bilateral main bronchus. Histological findings from these areas demonstrated infiltration by numerous lymphocytes and plasma cells, indicating tracheobronchitis and laryngitis. Notably, the patient had no symptoms related to these upper airway diseases (UADs).

Dexamethasone, administered as premedication for chemotherapy against lung cancer, proved efficacious in treating these extraintestinal manifestations of CD. This case is unique due to the concomitant appearance of bronchial lesions and UADs in a patient with well-controlled CD.

Her lung cancer diagnosis was established two months prior to presentation, and she was undergoing chemotherapy. Physical examination revealed a flat, non-distended abdomen with normal bowel sounds. Abdominal palpation showed a soft, flaccid abdomen without tenderness, palpable masses, or organomegaly. Tympanic sounds were elicited during abdominal percussion. Electrolytes and complete blood counts were within normal ranges. Upper gastrointestinal imaging examination with meglumine diatrizoate revealed a large, hook-shaped, ptotic gastric lumen with normal motility. Contrast agent demonstrated an abnormal round-trip flow anterior to the spine at the duodenal level, with pooling and gradual passage through this region in strands after prolonged retention. Contrast-enhanced abdominal CT scan revealed an anomalous alignment of the superior mesenteric vein (SMV), closely approximating the abdominal aorta (AA). The SMV extended course, anteriorly accompanying the AA. The third portion of the duodenum traversed the anterior aspect of the spine at the level of the third lumbar vertebra through a confined passage between the SMV and AA, with the distance between the two vessels measuring 4.7 mm. Upper gastrointestinal imaging examination with 50 mL meglumine diatrizoate showed contrast agent in the first and second portions of the duodenum, with abrupt compression in the third portion and retrograde flow proximal to the obstruction. Sagittal plane imaging showed the SMV and AA were nearly parallel, with a minimum distance of 4.7 mm. Reconstruction revealed the complete horizontal part of the duodenum, with dilation and narrowing. Contrast-enhanced CT scan revealed an anomaly in the alignment of the SMV and AA, coursing parallelly and closely. The horizontal segment of the duodenum traversed the interstice, giving rise to the impression of compression exerted by the SMV and AA on the duodenum. Upper gastrointestinal imaging showed dilation of the first and second portions of the duodenum, abrupt vertical compression of the third portion of the duodenum, and retrograde flow of contrast medium proximal to the obstruction. The SMV and AA ran in nearly parallel alignment over a considerable distance. The duodenum traversed the AA and SMV, with a distance of 4.7 mm between these vessels, confirming duodenal compression by the SMV in close proximity to the AA. No midgut malrotation was evident, but the first and second branches of the SMV coursed ventrally through the SMA to the left side of the main trunk of the SMA. Contrast-enhanced CT showed the proximity of the SMV to the AA and the compression of the duodenum.

It was considered that the compression of the duodenum between the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and abdominal aorta (AA) in the patient resulted in intermittent duodenal obstruction. This case represents a rare anatomical abnormality in which the distance between the SMA and AA is unusually short, resulting in the third part of the duodenum being compressed between the two vessels, producing symptoms of duodenal obstruction and compression. This scenario reveals a distinctive case characterized by duodenal compression between the AA and SMV, culminating in the episodic manifestation of duodenal obstruction.

graph_447,True,"A 65-year-old Caucasian male, diagnosed with Stage 3B (T3 N3 M0) squamous cell carcinoma of the right upper lobe (RUL) three years earlier, was found on surveillance sequential Computed Tomography (CT) scans to have an interval increase in a residual right hilar mass and regional lymph nodes. He had been experiencing worsening exertional dyspnoea and intermittent haemoptysis over several months. He denied constitutional symptoms. Clinical examination revealed a mild-moderate bilateral expiratory wheeze and oxygen saturations within normal parameters (SpO2 = 96 % on room air). The patient presented for initial evaluation with suspected tumour recurrence. After bronchoscopic biopsies, he was found to have squamous metaplasia with the formation of a bronchial stricture and focal endobronchial nodules; both outcomes are likely secondary to radiation therapy. Radiation therapy can cause delayed injury to the lung parenchyma resulting in a spectrum of changes from radiation pneumonitis to radiation fibrosis. Clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic, mild and rarely severe respiratory symptoms. Central airway injury secondary to radiation therapy is less well documented, but can present as tracheobronchial squamous metaplasia, which may impair mucociliary clearance and rarely itself undergo neoplastic transformation. Radiation exposure may also result in the formation of tracheobronchial strictures and stenosis.

Her urinalysis showed positive nitrates, traces of protein, moderate red blood cells (RBCs) and white blood cells (WBCs), and moderate blood; therefore, she was admitted with a case of urinary tract infection and was started on antibiotics intravenously for two weeks. Abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) was ordered to rule out hydronephrosis. A computed tomography was ordered for her to rule out hydronephrosis, and incidentally, ovarian cysts were discovered that were then bilaterally excised via laparotomy. Further evaluation via pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was needed to determine the origin of the cyst, which demonstrated non-complicated cystic lesions bilaterally, most likely to be peritoneal inclusion cysts, and also showed evidence of uterine duplication anomalies. In addition, colocutaneous fistula and pelvic collections developed post-operatively.

This case report summarizes respiratory health surveillance data collected from 6,951 Western Australian mine workers between 2001 and 2012. The study population had a mean age of 35.8 years (SD 10.9), with 90.4% being men. A significant proportion (79.7%) worked 12-hour shifts. The majority of the cohort (6,563) were monitored once, while 178 were monitored twice, eight monitored three times, and two monitored four times during the study period.

Respiratory health surveillance was conducted using a standardized respiratory questionnaire, lung function testing, audiometric (hearing) testing, and chest x-rays in some cases. The respiratory questionnaire assessed current respiratory symptoms experienced in the last 3 months, including cough, phlegm, wheeze, breathlessness, and any other respiratory symptom.

Occupational details revealed that 52.4% of the subjects were engaged in underground mining activities, 29.3% in surface production, and 18.2% were managers. A concerning finding was that approximately 84% of mine workers reported not wearing a protective mask during dusty activities. 65.5% of the mine workers were non-smokers.

**Year-Specific Cohort Details:**

*   **2001:** The study included 410 mine workers with a mean age of 35.9 (SD 9.9). The cohort was predominantly male (93.4%), with 6.6% being female. Occupational roles were distributed as follows: 19.5% managers, 25.9% in surface production, and 54.6% in underground mining. Mask usage was low, with 89.0% reporting not wearing a mask and only 11.0% reporting mask use.

*   **2002:** The study included 558 mine workers with a mean age of 36.7 (SD 10.3). The cohort remained predominantly male (93.7%), with 6.3% being female. Occupational roles were: 17.0% managers, 23.8% in surface production, and 59.1% in underground mining. Mask usage remained low, with 88.9% reporting not wearing a mask and 11.1% reporting mask use.

*   **2003:** The study included 512 mine workers with a mean age of 36.8 (SD 10.4). The cohort composition was 7.4% female and 92.6% male.

Multiple enlarged lymph nodes were observed in the left hilum and mediastinum.

Initially, the patient was considered to have lumbar disc herniation and received symptomatic pain relief, but the symptoms did not improve. Subsequently, the patient developed periumbilical distending pain. An enhanced abdominal CT scan revealed acute pancreatitis, multiple low-density nodules in the liver (nature undetermined), a left adrenal gland nodule (highly suggestive of metastasis), and local bone destruction in the left ilium, acetabulum, left side of the pubic symphysis, and left pubic branch (suggestive of metastasis).

Further investigation with a chest CT scan showed a mass in the right upper lobe, multiple mildly enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum, and bilateral pleural effusions. A head MRI revealed abnormal enhancing lesions in the left frontal and parietal cortex (suggestive of metastasis) and an abnormal enhancing lesion in the right frontal lobe (metastasis not ruled out). A bone scan showed abnormal tracer accumulation in the left hip, proximal femur, and right scapula, suggestive of metastasis.

A percutaneous lung biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), favoring adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemical staining showed the cancer cells were positive for CK7, NaspsinA, TTF-1, and CK9, and negative for CK20.

The myeloma was reasonably controlled (partial response) at time of NSCLC diagnosis with an ongoing carfilzomib/daratumumab/dexamethasone 5th-line therapy. Prior treatments included lenalidomide, bortezomib, high-dose melphalan and autologous stem cell transplant, pomalidomide and dexamethasone, thalidomide, cisplatin, adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide (DT-PACE), to which the myeloma was either refractory or the patient intolerant due to toxicity. Relevant medical history included chronic thrombocytopenia of likely autoimmune pathogenesis and deep vein thrombosis and extensive pulmonary embolism in 2016, contributing to persistent dyspnoea. Patient performance status at time of NSCLC diagnosis was ECOG 1.

In contrast to the NSCLC, the myeloma did not respond to pembrolizumab and paraprotein levels continued to rise over 10 months of concurrent pembrolizumab and anti-myeloma therapy until clinical progression, with transfusion-dependent anaemia and severe dyspnoea and fatigue, resulting in reduced performance status [Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 2]. The patient reported no immune-related adverse events and response evaluation by computed tomography imaging continued to demonstrate an ongoing partial response of the NSCLC.

No approved and/or suitable anti-myeloma treatments were available at the time and NSCLC excluded the patient from participation in clinical trials. A bone marrow myeloma fluorescence *in situ* hybridisation analysis was performed based on emerging data on venetoclax activity in myeloma, and a t(11;14) translocation was detected.

The swab samples were taken twice within 72 hours and real-time reverse-transcription polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) results were COVID-19 negative. The anti-PD-1 related pneumonitis mixed with bacterial infection was clinically diagnosed based on the laboratory and radiological evidences and good response to the prednisolone and antibiotics. The patient's case highlights the difficulty in differentiating between COVID-19 pneumonia and anti-PD-1 related pneumonitis, as they possess similar clinical presentations and CT imaging features. Differential diagnosis depends on the epidemiological and immunotherapy histories, and RT-PCR tests.

graph_473,False,"A 64-year-old man with a history of adenocarcinoma of the right lung with metastasis to vertebral and mediastinal lymph nodes, and coronary artery disease, presented with back pain. Thoracic MRI revealed a T7 pathological compression fracture with lytic bone lesions secondary to metastatic disease. During his admission, he developed new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which resolved spontaneously without intervention. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) did not reveal intra-cardiac thrombi. He was discharged on aspirin and β-blockers due to a low CHADS-VASC score.

The following day, the patient returned to the hospital confused. Brain MRI revealed an acute lacunar ischemic infarction in the right centrum semiovale. On admission, he was again in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Chest x-ray revealed a stable right infrahilar mass with adjacent subsegmental atelectasis. A repeat TTE was negative for any intra-cardiac thrombus or masses.

He was diagnosed with an acute ischemic stroke, minor, with no hemorrhagic conversion, and placed on IV heparin. Brain and neck magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) revealed mild atherosclerotic disease. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) showed a small echo density at the orifice of the right upper pulmonary vein, suspicious for a thrombus, with a low flow velocity across the pulmonary vein (26.6 cm/s, normal 30–80 cm/s) and no other left atrial or left ventricular thrombus formation. Chest x-ray showed a right-sided infrahilar mass with adjacent subsegmental atelectasis. 2D transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) revealed thrombus in the right upper pulmonary vein. Multiple prior thoracic CT scans to evaluate lung cancer and thoracic spine for back pain did not reveal any pulmonary vein thrombosis (PVT). A decision was made not to repeat a thorax CT scan to confirm the findings of PVT as the patient was already on anticoagulation."
graph_473,True,"A patient presented with a complex medical history involving multiple clinical events. The patient experienced dyspnea, cough, and hemoptysis, suggestive of underlying pulmonary issues. Initial investigations revealed lung cancer, later specified as metastatic lung adenocarcinoma. The patient also suffered from multiple cerebrovascular accidents, including strokes.

Further investigation revealed the presence of Pulmonary Vein Thrombosis (PVT), also described as thrombosis of the vein and pulmonary venous narrowing. The patient also had atrial fibrillation. The patient's condition was further complicated by hyper-viscosity syndromes, potentially related to polycythemia, hemoglobinopathies, and sickle cell disease. The patient's condition was also complicated by the presence of atrial myxoma.

The patient underwent a lobectomy and radiofrequency catheter ablation, likely in an attempt to manage the lung cancer and atrial fibrillation, respectively. Lung transplantation was also considered. Despite these interventions, the patient experienced peripheral embolization, indicating the persistence of embolism and thrombosis. The patient's condition was attributed to malignancy-related etiologies, including direct extension of the tumor and the overall malignancy burden. Turbulent flow and stasis were also identified as contributing factors to the thrombotic events. The patient's PVT was a recurring issue.
"
graph_474,True,"Patients with lung cancer (LC) are at significantly higher risk of developing venous thromboembolism (VTE), which may lead to increased use of health resources and the cost of the disease management. VTE, including pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT), constitutes a major health problem. Cancer-associated VTE (CAT) occurs in 4–20% of cancer patients and is associated with elderly age at diagnosis, increase of cancer prevalence, advances in the diagnosis of incidental VTE, and anti-tumoral drugs with thrombotic properties.

In a study, more than half of patients (55.3%) had PE, and 44.7% had DVT. Pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis were the two principal causes for hospitalizations, in 65.2%, and 21.7% of the patients, respectively. Pulmonary embolism represents a pooled incidence of 3.7% in lung cancer patients.

The main cost driver was in hospital stays, especially for those patients who suffer from PE. The decision to admit PE patients in hospital is based on some prognostic scales in the general population, such as Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI) (or simplified version, sPESI) to predict 30-day mortality based on easily determinable clinical findings (age, cancer history, history of chronic cardiovascular disease, heart rate ≥110, systolic blood pressure <100 mm Hg, oxygen Saturation <90%).

The main clinical practice guidelines recognize LMWH as the standard treatment of care for CAT. Clinicians who treat CAT should be aware that this event is not merely a complication but has a broader impact on the patient’s quality of life. Early prevention, diagnosis and treatment of CAT can save lives. The direct cost of CAT is €10,969.6 per patient and semester. Choosing optimal treatment option with LMWH could be considered as an optimal strategy to significantly reduce the direct cost in cancer associated thrombosis.

Although the pathogenesis of thromboembolic events in cancer is likely multifactorial, chemotherapy and immobilization are considered two of the risk factors to develop thromboembolic events.

graph_476,True,"A patient presented with a complex clinical picture involving pulmonary and systemic manifestations. The patient experienced symptoms including cough, fever, and weight loss, suggestive of a possible underlying condition. Initial investigations revealed the presence of pneumonia and raised suspicion for lung cancer. Further complicating the presentation were oral and extra-oral infections, raising concerns about a potential source of hematogenous spread.

The patient's condition deteriorated, leading to respiratory distress. Invasive pneumonia was diagnosed, necessitating treatment with antibiotics. Despite the antibiotic therapy, the patient's condition remained challenging, leading to a diagnostic dilemma between an infectious process and malignancy. Tissue biopsies were performed to further investigate the possibility of lung cancer.

The patient also reported shoulder pain, and imaging revealed bone destruction and soft tissue inflammation, potentially indicating osteo-articular or soft tissue involvement. Brachial plexopathy was also noted. The possibility of tuberculosis was considered, along with other potential infections, including urethral infections, infective endocarditis, brain abscess, and lung infection. Dental disease was also identified as a potential contributing factor. Microscopic examination revealed inflammatory cells, further supporting the presence of an infection. The patient was also diagnosed with Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.

The patient had a 3-year history of primary hypertension, managed with indapamide 2.5 mg daily, maintaining a blood pressure of 140/90 mm.

A chest CT (plain + enhanced) prior to Hg. Endostar treatment revealed: patchy density shadow in the left lung; left lung lesions with exudative changes; enlarged lymph nodes with marked enhancement in the mediastinum near the aortic arch; a massive space-occupying lesion of the left hilar mass; a lumpy soft tissue-like density shadow with an unclear boundary and pleural adhesion at the level of the tracheal bifurcation, showing inhomogeneous enhancement after contrast; and an enlarged left supraclavicular lymph node with slight enhancement post-contrast.

The patient underwent 4 cycles of chemotherapy with albumin-bound paclitaxel 300mg on day 1 and cisplatin injection 30 mg from days 1 to 3, resulting in significant lesion reduction in the left lung, indicating partial remission. The family opted for surveillance every 3 months, rather than continuing chemotherapy.

In July 2021, a CT scan revealed lesion progression in the left lung, leading to conformal intensity-modulated radiation therapy for the left lung.

In October 2021, the patient was admitted for further maintenance therapy. A lung CT and electrocardiogram indicated an enlarged cardiac silhouette and minimal pericardial and left pleural effusion. Physical examination revealed that the breath sounds of both lungs were clear, there was no engorgement of the external jugular vein, and no clear contraindications to treatment."

Chest radiography revealed a mass at the apex of the left lung. A transbronchial lung biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

The patient subsequently underwent a left upper segmentectomy and lymph node dissection. Macroscopic examination of the resected mass revealed it was 6.0 cm in its greatest dimension, with a white-to-tan color on the cut surface. Microscopic examination showed the solid tumor was composed of polygonal cells with round vesicular nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and slightly eosinophilic or amphophilic abundant cytoplasm.

Histopathology of the resected tumor showed scattered multinucleated cells, multifocal necrosis, and hemorrhage. No squamous or glandular features were observed. No lymph node metastasis was detected. PD-L1 tumor proportion score was 60%. Resection revealed a 6.0 cm left upper lobe tumor with pleural invasion, classified as pT4 N0. Further investigation revealed a left hilar mass 8.5 cm in diameter involving major bronchi, ipsilateral pleural effusion, and a 1.9 cm diameter mass in the left upper lobe.

Further staging revealed a 3.1 cm diameter tumor in the right upper lobe, lymph node metastasis, and brain metastasis. Immunohistochemistry of tumor cells showed coexpression of p40 (BC28; Roche Diagnostics) in approximately 80% of tumor cells and TTF-1 (8G7G3/1; Dako) in 10% of cases. Immunohistochemistry also showed positive staining for anti-TTF-1 (SPT24; Novocastra) in 40% of cases. Most TTF-1-positive samples were also positive for p40, indicating coexpression of p40 and TTF-1. The TTF-1 staining intensity of SPT24 was stronger than that of 8G7G3/1.

He underwent left upper segmentectomy and lymph node dissection. Macroscopically, the mass showed a white-to-tan solid tumor on the cut surface. Microscopically, the tumor was composed of polygonal tumor cells which had round and vesicular nuclei with prominent nucleoli. Multifocal necrosis and hemorrhage were also noted. No lymph node metastasis was detected. Approximately four months after the segmentectomy, recurrence in the lumbar vertebrae was observed. Despite postoperative chemoradiotherapy, the patient died of cancer nine months after the surgery. Most lung carcinomas are subtyped by their morphologies; however, immunohistochemistry is usually performed when it is difficult to determine. The most reliable antibodies for distinguishing lung adenocarcinoma from squamous cell carcinoma are thyroid transcription factor‐1 (TTF‐1) and p40 (ΔNp63). In general, these markers are mutually exclusive in their expression of lung primary carcinoma; however, a few cases of non‐small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) with coexpression of both markers have been reported.

On examination, his body temperature was 37.1°C, heart rate was 88 beats/min, blood pressure was 120/66 mmHg, and peripheral oxygen saturation was 98%. A 7 x 5 cm, elastic, soft, mobile, and non-tender lymph node was palpable in the left neck. No other swollen lymph nodes were identified in the axillary or groin regions.

Abdominal examination was unremarkable. Laboratory findings included a red blood cell count of 4.11 × 10^6/μl; C-reactive protein, 1.50 mg/dl; lactate dehydrogenase, 416 U/L; alkaline phosphatase, 746 U/L; neuron-specific enolase, 20.7 ng/ml, and soluble interleukin 2 receptor, 5862 U/L. Chest radiography revealed a nodular shadow approximately 2 cm in maximum diameter in the upper right field. CT of the chest revealed a 24 × 21 × 18 mm nodule with a cavity in Segment 1 of the right upper lobe. No swelling of the mediastinal lymph nodes was evident.

FDG-PET showed the nodule in the right upper lobe with a maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of 9.4. Strong FDG accumulation was also noted in the left cervical lymph nodes, both axillary lesions, near the pancreatic head, both external iliac arteries, and the right inguinal lymph nodes. No abnormal FDG accumulation was seen in the liver, bone, adrenal glands, or spleen. MRI of the head showed no abnormalities.

Transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) revealed squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. A left cervical lymph node biopsy was performed. Immunohistochemistry of the lymph node revealed that CD20, CD79a, Bcl-2, and CD10 were positive, leading to a diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma NOS.

The lung cancer was staged as IA, and the malignant lymphoma was staged as IVA.

The patient received two courses of R-CHOP (Rituximab + cyclophosphamide + hydroxydaunorubicin + vincristine + prednisolone) therapy for the malignant lymphoma. Soluble IL-2R normalized to 466 from 14,003 U/mL.

Follow-up chest radiographs and CT of the chest revealed that the nodular shadows in the right upper lung field had increased, and new cavities appeared. FDG-PET showed that the maximum SUV in the lung tumor increased from 9.4 to 10.5, but accumulation in the lymphoma lesions remained only in the left inguinal region, with little accumulation in other areas.

Surgery was then performed for the lung cancer. A right upper lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node dissection was performed."

Two weeks later, the patient represented with an increase in lump size, associated with pain and blood oozing from the mass (estimated at around 500 ml). The lump demonstrated a fungating ulcerated appearance associated with a foul-smelling discharge.

Examination revealed no craniofacial or cervical lymphadenopathy. Oral cavity and flexible nasendoscopy were unremarkable. Paraprotein and virology screen were negative. A sample was negative for microscopy, culture and sensitivity, and acid-fast bacilli. Histology confirmed squamous cell carcinoma with PD-L1 almost 90%.

Immunohistochemistry results were: AE1/3, CK7, and P40 positive; CK20, TTF1, CD56, and p16 negative. Cross-sectional imaging of the neck, thorax, and abdomen reported an anterior soft tissue mass measuring 6.1 cm, a left upper lobe mass, right lung metastases, and a subcutaneous metastatic deposit in the neck.

A pulmonology multi-disciplinary meeting outcome favored surgical intervention, but the plastic surgery team deemed surgery too extensive. An oncology opinion was sought.

A decision was made to commence palliative radiotherapy followed by Pembrolizumab immunotherapy. The anterior neck mass had grown to 10 cm in size and was protruding 8 cm outwards from the neck. The mass was fungating and ulcerated.

Funduscopic examination revealed severe bilateral optic disc edema, optic neuropathy, and retinal vascular occlusion associated with high intracranial pressure. In June 2023, a lateral ventricular Ommaya capsule was implanted, and the CSF pressure was measured at 320 mm H2O. Intrathecal chemotherapy (ITC) with pemetrexed (30 mg every 1–2 weeks) was administered through the Ommaya capsule.

In August 2023, the patient's neurological symptoms worsened, including disorientation, confused speech, and hallucinations. CSF analysis revealed a significant number of malignant tumor cells. Genetic testing of the CSF identified CDKN2A nonsense mutation (VAF 66.74%), BRAF G596R mutation (VAF 20.58%), BRAF N581I (VAF 1.83%), BRAF K483E (VAF 1.14%), BRAF G466R (VAF 0.75%), and RET fusion mutation (VAF 0.25%). Cranial MRI did not show clear signs of tumor metastasis. Due to the deteriorating efficacy of ITC with pemetrexed, it was replaced with gemcitabine. The patient's neurological symptoms and headache were significantly relieved, but the visual status remained unchanged. Based on the detection of BRAF gene mutations in the patient’s CSF, targeted therapy with trametinib (a MET inhibitor) was considered.

A chest CT was performed to assess the patient's condition, but showed no changes compared to the previous scan. Diagnostic workup and imaging review led to a confirmed diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma with leptomeningeal metastasis (LM). The patient was classified as having stage CT3NxM1a lung cancer according to the Eighth Edition of the TNM Classification for Lung Cancer.

Treatment was initiated for the lung adenocarcinoma with leptomeningeal metastasis. A lumbar puncture was performed, revealing a CSF pressure >330 mmH2O. 30 mL of CSF was released, and intrathecal chemotherapy (ITC) was administered, consisting of dexamethasone 5 mg with pemetrexed 50 mg (day 1, day 10).

The patient's headache and vomiting symptoms improved significantly, and CSF cytology was negative for malignant cells, indicating a response to the initial intrathecal chemotherapy. Systemic therapy was initiated with pemetrexed and bevacizumab as first-line treatment and maintenance therapy. Efficacy was evaluated as stable disease.

Despite systemic therapy, the patient's headache and vomiting worsened by the end of cycle 6. Intrathecal chemotherapy regimen was administered multiple times. Cephalic symptoms and lung lesions remained stable. Cranial MRI showed no clear manifestations of brain parenchymal or meningeal metastases. CSF analysis revealed no malignant tumor cells.

The patient then presented with worsening headache, vomiting, and transient loss of consciousness. Due to poor response to pemetrexed, the intrathecal chemotherapy regimen was switched to gemcitabine (20 mg, 1/week), resulting in relief of headache and vomiting symptoms.

Second-line systemic therapy was initiated with intravenous PD-1 inhibitor tislelizumab (200 mg, 1/21 days) combined with oral anlotinib (8 mg, 1/day). Anlotinib was discontinued after one cycle due to uncontrolled hypertension.

Genetic testing of the CSF using second-generation sequencing technology revealed a BRAF N581I missense mutation (abundance 13.93%) and a CDKN2A mutation (abundance 39.21%).

Head contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging showed no lesions. Although the shape of the tumor appeared to be benign, its tendency to grow and the presence of F-18 FDG accumulation could not rule out lung cancer. Therefore, a differential diagnosis of primary lung cancer stage IB (cT2aN0M0) was made. Preoperative biopsies were not performed due to the location of the tumor.

The preoperative differential diagnosis was cStageIB lung cancer. A right middle lobectomy was performed, and a histopathology examination revealed meningioma.

Histological report indicated stage pT3b N1 Mx R1 prostate adenocarcinoma with a single lymph node metastasis. Adjuvant treatment with leuprorelin was initiated. Subsequently, the patient was admitted to the emergency room for acute respiratory distress. A CT scan showed left pleural effusion, thickening, and nodules of the pleural surface, several mediastinal lymph node metastases, and a bone metastasis in the IX left rib. Pleural effusion cytology came back negative for malignancy. An ultrasound-guided bone biopsy of the lesion at the IX rib level was carried out. Histology of the bone biopsy revealed malignant cells with adenocarcinoma aggregation. Immunohistochemistry showed the cancer cells were highly immunoreactive for TTF-1 and BerEP4 and negative for the prostatic markers NKX3.1 and PSA, leading to a diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma. CT scans of the lung lesions after chemotherapy with carboplatin and pemetrexed showed significant response to therapy of mediastinal, pleural, and lung lesions. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) profiling of the rib lesion revealed the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion as a unique alteration.

Chest computed tomography (CT) showed a 4.0-cm right upper lobe tumor, leading to a diagnosis of right lung cancer (cT3N0M0, stage IIB). The patient underwent a right upper lobectomy and lymph node dissection. Pathological examination revealed the tumor to be pleomorphic carcinoma (pT3N0M0, stage IIB). Six months after surgery, tumor recurrence was observed in the lung, pleura, adrenal gland, and bone. Molecular profiling revealed high expression of PD-L1 without other molecular mutations. The patient received pembrolizumab monotherapy. After five cycles of pembrolizumab, the recurrent tumors showed shrinkage (Figure 1a,b). A skin rash developed after seven cycles of pembrolizumab, leading to the cessation of treatment. One month after the development of the skin rash, the patient developed pneumonitis (Figure 1c,d)."

graph_498,False,"A 34-year-old male with Bloom Syndrome (BS) presented for care. His diagnosis of BS was delayed due to living in refugee camps in Honduras. In 1990, the patient and his family came to Canada as refugees. At age 13, he presented to the hospital with short stature. His mother reported that he stopped growing at age 10. Examination revealed facial erythema, microcephaly, and delayed mental development. The patient was evaluated by medical genetics. A skin biopsy from his left arm was taken for cytogenetics; 103 cells examined showed three cell lines. Cultured fibroblasts by fluorescent banding showed a male.

Later, the patient with Bloom Syndrome (BS) was involved in a motor vehicle accident as a pedestrian.

In January 2011, the patient presented to a trauma follow-up clinic and discovered a new mass on the left side of his neck. Physical examination revealed a mobile, 2-3 cm lymph node in the left posterior cervical chain that was tender to palpation. In January 2011, a fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the left posterior cervical chain lymph node was suggestive of a reactive process (i.e., numerous and variable lymphocytes, neutrophils, and histiocytes). In February 2011, a Tru-Cut core needle biopsy was taken from the left posterior cervical chain lymph node for flow cytometric testing to confirm the absence of a B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder. The biopsy stained positive for CD20, suggestive of B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder, but there was no definitive evidence of clonality based on kappa lambda staining. Staging investigations were initiated, including a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. A bone marrow aspirate biopsy and cytogenetics were ordered to look for more conclusive evidence of a B-cell malignancy. Bone marrow aspirate, flow cytometry, and cytology were normal."

One month prior to presentation, the dyspnea worsened to mMRC stage 3. The patient's condition worsened, leading to acute respiratory distress, characterized by desaturation to 78% in ambient air, polypnea at 25 cycles per minute, cyanosis of the extremities, signs of respiratory struggle, and crackles on the left side of the pleuropulmonary region. A diagnostic workup was initiated to investigate the cause of respiratory distress. Chest X-ray showed bilateral alveolar opacities. Lab results revealed hypereosinophilia (up to 1170), a hemoglobin level at 15.9g/l, white blood cells at 13,700/mm3, platelets at 320,000/mm3, correct renal function, a negative COVID-19 PCR test, a negative GeneXpert for tuberculosis in the sputum, and a negative cytobacteriological examination of the sputum. Stool parasitology was also negative. Further imaging was performed to characterize lung abnormalities. A thoracic CT scan showed diffuse foci of pulmonary parenchymal condensation, involving the various pulmonary lobes with areas of ground glass. Chest CT showed bilateral consolidations with ground glass. Bronchoscopy and biopsies were performed to evaluate lung abnormalities. Bronchial fibroscopy showed a normal endoscopic appearance. Staged bronchial biopsies returned to normal, fibroaspiration in search of neoplastic cells did not detect tumor cells, and the patient did not tolerate BAL.

graph_499,True,"A patient, a chronic smoker, presented with respiratory distress, including a dry cough, dyspnea, polypnea, and cyanosis of the extremities. The patient also exhibited respiratory struggle. Despite the severity of symptoms, the patient's general condition was preserved. Pleuropulmonary examination revealed crackles. Initial investigations included a chest X-ray, which showed bilateral alveolar opacities. The patient also exhibited desaturation and blood hypereosinophilia. COVID-19 PCR and GeneXpert for tuberculosis were negative.

Further investigation with a thoracic CT scan revealed ground glass areas and diffuse condensations. Given the hypereosinophilia and lung findings, eosinophilic lung was considered. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and induced sputum were performed. A CT-guided biopsy was also conducted.

The patient was initially treated with corticosteroid therapy, later specified as systemic corticosteroid therapy.

Pathological examination of the biopsy revealed lepidic adenocarcinoma, a type of lung cancer and one of the primary lung cancers. The CT scan also showed diffuse alveolar opacities, pulmonary nodules, and areas of ground glass. The patient's dyspnea worsened. The final diagnosis was lepidic adenocarcinoma with associated eosinophilic lung.

On admission, he exhibited severe ataxia, downbeat and horizontal nystagmus in all directions of gaze, dysarthria, dysphagia, loss of tendon reflexes, and dysuria. Videoendoscopic examination of swallowing showed a pooling of saliva in the pyriform fossae and a diminished cough reflex. Thickened water was not cleared from the hypopharynx by swallowing several times, and part of it was aspirated.

Blood examinations showed no abnormalities, including thyroid function and vitamin B1, vitamin B12, and folic acid levels. The antinuclear antibody titer was 1:80, and anti-GAD, anti-GM1, anti-GQ1b, anti-SS-A, anti-SS-B, and anti-AChR antibodies were negative. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination showed mild pleocytosis (6 cells/\u00b5L) (100% mononuclear cells), elevated protein levels (65.8 mg/dL), and a normal IgG index. Analysis of the CSF showed no infectious or malignant etiologies. MRI of the head was unremarkable. (123I) N-isopropyl-p-iodoamphetamine (IMP) brain perfusion SPECT did not show perfusion abnormalities.

Based on these findings, subacute autoimmune-mediated cerebellitis with brainstem involvement was suspected. The patient was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) at a dose of 400 mg/kg for five days, but there was no improvement in the neurological symptoms. Two days after IVIG therapy, two courses of high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone, followed by oral prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day), were administered.

Further investigation via immunoblotting of serum was positive (+++) for anti-amphiphysin antibodies and positive (+) for anti-SRY-box transcription factor 1 (SOX1) antibody. Other antibodies associated with paraneoplastic neurological syndromes were negative. This led to a final diagnosis of non-stiff anti-amphiphysin syndrome with coexistence of anti-SOX1."

Chest CT showed a pure GGO lesion measuring 8 mm in diameter in the anterior segment of the right upper lobe. The patient quit smoking approximately 15 years previously and regularly saw a family doctor for chronic gastritis.

The patient had laboratory workup for tumor markers (carcinoembryonic antigen, squamous cell carcinoma antigen, cytokeratin 19 fragment) which were unremarkable. Suspicion of slow-growing early-stage non-small cell lung cancer arose.

The patient underwent segmentectomy (anterior segment of the right upper lobe) via video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.

Pathologic examination of the resected specimen showed thickening of the alveolar septum caused by the proliferation of capillary vessels without cytological atypia.

Immunohistochemistry of resected specimen was negative for thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) and cytokeratin, and positive for CD31 and CD34. The final diagnosis was SPCH (solid papillary capillary hemangioma).

The patient’s postoperative course was uneventful. A chest CT showed a pure ground glass opacity, with a maximum diameter of 8 mm, located in the subpleural area of the right upper lung.

graph_502,True,"A 64-year-old woman was referred to our hospital with complaints of dizziness and vomiting. She was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma with EGFR G719X mutation and multiple intraventricular metastases. Brain is one of the most common target organ of lung cancer metastasis, while descriptions of intraventricular carcinomatosis could hardly be found among previous cases. To date no cases from lung adenocarcinoma have been reported in the literature. Compared to brain parenchyma metastasis, intraventricular lesions would cause more severe symptoms which may be rapidly progressive. Target therapy with afatinib was initiated and the lesions in both lung and brain achieved good partial responses. This case report revealed a phenomenon of rare intraventricular metastasis from lung cancer, which should be carefully distinguished from primary ventricular tumors. Target therapy could become a potential option in such patients with non-drugresistant EGFR mutations. Up to 50% of pulmonary carcinoma patients would develop brain metastases throughout their clinical courses, and 10–25% of them have brain metastases at the time of initial diagnosis.

Positron emission tomography (PET) indicated a nodular lesion in left upper lung with diffuse bilateral lung metastases and multiple intraventricular masses. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain showed a mass at the posterior horn of the right lateral ventricle and the IV ventricle, respectively. T1 brain MRI showed isointense lesions with heterogeneous enhancement on contrast. T2 brain MRI showed hyperintense masses, remarkable dilation and hydrocephalus of upper cerebral ventricle and parenchyma edema around encephalocoele. There was no obvious involvement of brain parenchyma. Chest CT showed a 1 cm x 1 cm irregular nodule in the upper lobe of left lung, with diffuse bilateral pulmonary metastases. Contrast-enhanced MRI of brain showed heterogeneously enhancing lesions at the posterior horn of the right lateral ventricle and the IV ventricle, with upper ventricle hydrocephalus and edema of the surrounding parenchyma. T2FLAIR brain MRI showed slightly higher signal of the masses. Lung adenocarcinoma was histopathologically diagnosed by endobronchial ultrasound transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA). EGFR mutation in exon 18 (G719X) was identified. Afatinib was administered at a dose of 30 mg qd. Symptoms improved significantly within one month of Afatinib treatment. Three months after Afatinib treatment, reevaluation showed partial remission in both lung and brain lesions. Bilateral lung nodules evidently shrunk. Intraventricular lesions and surrounding area of edema observably shrunk with restored ventricular dilatation. Repeated CT of chest showed bilateral pulmonary nodules increased and enlarged, while intracerebral lesions remained stable. Ten months after targeted therapy, lesions of lung progressed.

His chest was clear bilaterally, but his abdomen was distended and tensed due to ascites. An abdominal paracentesis was performed to alleviate the abdominal distension. Subsequent testing revealed an underlying COVID-19 infection. A COVID-19 PCR test was positive. A chest CT scan revealed ground-glass opacities and a large lobulated circumferential mass filling the left hemithorax with multifocal extensions and hilar, tracheobronchial and subcarinal lymphadenopathy. The chest CT also showed multifocal extensions through the diaphragm, chest wall and mediastinal fats, residual circumferential hypodense pleural thickening involving the mediastinal, costal and diaphragmatic pleural surfaces, and erosion of the inner aspect of multiple ribs. The left lung was inflated with fibroelastic bands, indicative of stage IV mesothelioma. The patient complained of acute abdominal pain and heaviness. Based on the imaging and positive COVID-19 PCR, the patient was moved to the isolation ward.

In October 2016, a 55-year-old female presented with a cough. A chest CT revealed a lesion in the upper lobe of the left lung, leading to a diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma. In November 2016, she underwent a right upper lobectomy, during which visceral pleural involvement was detected. Postoperative pathology revealed pT2aN0M0, stage IB disease. Immunohistochemistry showed TTF-1 (+), NapsinA (+), TG (\u2212), ALK (\u2212), and ROS-1 (\u2212) invasive adenocarcinoma. The patient received four cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of pemetrexed plus cisplatin.

In April 2017, a follow-up contrast-enhanced CT scan showed a spinal metastasis, indicating stage IV disease. MSK-IMPACT sequencing revealed an EGFR exon 19 deletion without a KRAS mutation. Consequently, the patient was started on gefitinib (250mg/d) and achieved a stable disease state.

By January 2018, a contrast-enhanced CT scan detected another spinal metastasis. Molecular genetic testing confirmed the presence of an EGFR T790M mutation and a negative PD-L1 expression. The patient was then treated with Osimertinib (80 mg/d) for 12 months, after which an extensive bone metastasis was found using bone isotope scanning.

A re-biopsy of the bone metastasis showed negative results for the EGFR-T790 mutation but was positive for KRAS exon 2 (G12D, MAF:13.34%) and exon 3 (Q61H, MAF:0.43%) mutations, as well as the original EGFR exon 19 deletion (MAF:22.58%) mutation. Plasma circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) confirmed these findings via next-generation sequencing (NGS).

The patient then underwent two cycles of paclitaxel (albumin-bound) plus carboplatin for six weeks, but experienced no apparent benefits. Due to poor physical condition, the patient discontinued all anti-tumor treatments, including immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs).

graph_505,True,"We present a case of a 33-year-old immunocompetent man diagnosed with invasive pulmonary cryptococcal disease with spread to the brain. The patient had been previously treated for tuberculosis. His presentation included typical bronchopulmonary thoracic and extra-thoracic features, as well as computed tomography (CT) scan features suggestive of lung cancer. Cryptococcosis was diagnosed by identification of oval thick-walled yeast on histology of a lung biopsy specimen. This case is unique because the patient's presentation contrasted with the typical presentation of Cryptococcal pneumonias and Cryptococcal meningitis. Invasive cryptococcosis affecting the lung and brain may present with a clinical picture similar to metastatic lung cancer. Pulmonary cryptococcosis patients often present as cryptococcal pneumonia, whereas intracranial cryptococcosis presents with meningitis. Pulmonary cryptococcosis may have intracranial dissemination and may show a variety of radiological features.

The patient reported four episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizures prior to presentation, each lasting less than five minutes.

Further history revealed intermittent fever, cough associated with hemoptysis, and dyspnea on exertion. The patient had a history of two pack-years of tobacco use, stopped 10 years prior, and had been treated for pulmonary tuberculosis two years prior. Physical examination revealed a conscious, ill-looking, and cachectic individual.

Vitals showed a fever of 38.5°C, pulse rate of 130 bpm, and blood pressure of 164/126 mmHg. Examination revealed dullness to percussion in the right middle lung zones, diminished breath sounds over the same areas, and left-sided hemiparesis and ataxia. Power on the left side was 3/5.

Initial investigations, including a full blood count (FBC), electrolytes, urea, and creatinine (EUCr), and liver function tests (LFTs), were normal. ELISA HIV tests were negative. A chest X-ray showed a large mass in the right middle lung zone extending to the hilum.

Subsequent chest CT scan revealed a mass infiltrating the right upper and middle lung lobes, measuring 10 cm x 10 cm. A brain CT revealed a 5 cm mass and a 4 cm intracranial mass in the posterior cranial fossa with perilesional edema. A provisional diagnosis of metastatic lung cancer with intracerebral metastases was made.

An open surgical lung biopsy was performed. The biopsy revealed interstitial mononuclear infiltrate, numerous foamy macrophages, and granuloma formation with congested capillaries, focal fibrosis, and thickening of the interstitial alveolar septa. Further analysis of the lung biopsy showed numerous oval-shaped, thick-walled yeast cells compatible with Cryptococcus spp. Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS) staining was strongly positive for fungal cell walls. Immunohistochemical stains for cytokeratin 5/6, thyroid transcription factor 1, and lymphoma markers were negative.

The patient was initially treated with oral flucytosine 1500 mg every 6 hours and intravenous fluconazole 800 mg once daily for 7 days. This was followed by intravenous Amphotericin B 50 mg daily for 14 days, then transitioned to oral flucytosine 1500 mg every 6 hours and oral fluconazole 400 mg daily for 8 weeks, followed by fluconazole 200 mg daily for 6 months. Renal and LFTs were monitored during the 8 weeks of induction and treatment, with LFT and EUCr results remaining normal during this time.

The patient received one cycle of chemotherapy with paclitaxel in combination with nedaplatin, followed by maintenance treatment with lorlatinib. Two months later, clinical evaluations revealed progressive reduction of the lesions, especially the reduced size of the mediastinal lymph nodes. The patient then underwent thoracoscopic partial lobectomy and lymphadenectomy and achieved pathological complete response (pCR). After 3 months, a follow-up CT scan was similar to the first postoperative CT scan, and no tumor was found. This case demonstrates the potential advantage of lorlatinib as a neoadjuvant therapy in advanced ALK-positive NSCLC.

graph_508,True,"The case report focuses on three patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring uncommon EGFR Exon 19 delins mutations. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a known driver gene in NSCLC, and common Exon 19 deletions (e.g., p.E746_A750 del) typically respond well to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, the optimal treatment strategies for NSCLC patients with uncommon Exon 19 delins mutations are less understood.

The researchers identified three novel EGFR Exon 19 mutations: p.E746_S752delinsI, p.T751_I759delinsG, and p.L747_S752delinsAA.

One patient with advanced NSCLC and the EGFR p.E746_S752delinsI mutation benefited from treatment with Icotinib.

Two other patients had early-stage NSCLC. One patient, harboring the p.T751_I759delinsG mutation, had an excellent recovery after receiving horacoscopic radical resection. The other patient, with the p.L747_S752delinsAA mutation, experienced a relapse after undergoing the same surgical procedure.

The study highlights that patients with different Exon 19 delins mutations may have varying prognoses. The report also emphasizes the importance of next-generation sequencing (NGS) as a crucial tool for guiding clinical treatment decisions in NSCLC, as it can increase the detection of EGFR del-ins mutations compared to older screening methods. The true incidence of these mutations is currently unknown, but routine use of NGS is expected to improve detection rates.

Pathology of biopsy specimens obtained from the mediastinal lymph node and left main tumor by flexible bronchoscopy revealed SCLC. Systemic image analysis showed no distant metastasis, diagnosed with limited stage SCLC. Systemic chemoradiotherapy with carboplatin plus etoposide was initiated, leading to a significant reduction in the tumor size in the lung and mediastinal lymph node on chest X-ray and a decrease in the levels of serum tumor markers. The patient was discharged without any clinical signs or symptoms of PM/DM at 27 days after chemotherapy."
graph_509,True,"We herein report a 63-year-old woman with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) who developed dermatomyositis (DM) after initial chemoradiotherapy despite tumor reduction. Serum anti-transcriptional intermediary factor (TIF) 1γ antibody was detected before the development of DM, and its levels increased over time. She died five months after the diagnosis of SCLC. Anti-TIF1γ antibody is known to be a marker for cancer-associated DM (CAM); however, the present case indicates that the antibody can be found in cancer patients without DM. This case is also unusual, as DM developed later despite successful chemoradiotherapy.

However, considering the intolerable hepatotoxicity, the patient switched to take alectinib 1200 mg BID from January 20, 2020, due to gastrointestinal AEs. After 1 week, the clinician reduced the dosage to 600 mg BID, but the patient still had swelling in his legs and felt fatigued. Although alectinib remained effective on tumors, ceritinib (450 mg) was replaced after the AEs of hyperbilirubinemia occurred. The total bilirubin of this patient reached up to three times of reference range. Reexamination of liver function revealed that the level of alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) was 3–4 times higher than baseline, suggesting mild liver function impairment. He suffered from diarrhea and antidiarrheal drugs were ineffective. After reducing the dose to 300mg, the diarrhea AEs caused by ceritinib were effectively relieved, and the patient obtained sustained clinical benefit with progression-free survival nearly 12 months. During treatment with dose reduction of ceritinib, the patient’s blood routine tests and liver function tests were normal, and chest CT scan demonstrated stable disease.

The patient underwent right upper lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node dissection via median sternotomy. Histological diagnosis revealed squamous cell carcinoma (pT3aN0M0, Stage IIB).

Postoperatively, two drainage tubes were placed in the right thoracic cavity, and a total milky fluid volume of 2000 ml was drained on postoperative day (POD) 2. The volume of chylous drainage did not reduce with total parenteral nutrition.

On POD 4, right-sided video-assisted thoracic surgery was performed 1 hour after intake of ice cream, to identify the site of chylous leakage. Intraoperative observation revealed multiple leakage sites between the trachea and superior vena cava, which were clipped and sealed with fibrin glue. The thoracic duct could not be identified in the right posterior mediastinum. The volume of chylous drainage did not decrease after the surgical procedure.

On POD 5 the patient complained of dyspnea. Chest X-ray revealed left pleural effusion, and a drainage tube was inserted into the left pleural cavity.

This unique case of double pneumonitis (RP and RRP) highlights the importance of identifying immune or radiation pneumonitis, understanding its potential mechanism, and determining the appropriate treatment strategy after the emergence of RRP. Radiation pneumonitis (RP) is an acute inflammation that typically occurs within 6 months, most often within 12 weeks, after the end of radiation therapy (RT). Radiation recall pneumonitis (RRP) is an unpredictable acute inflammatory reaction within the previously irradiated lung area during the course of systematic therapy. RRP is mainly associated with chemotherapeutic drugs and EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), whereas RRP induced by immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has been rarely reported.

The use of these inhibitors is associated with a broad spectrum of immune-related adverse effects. This case report describes a 74-year-old male patient with advanced melanoma who was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with multiple organ failure due to suspected catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS) following treatment with pembrolizumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor.

The patient had been diagnosed with a superficial spreading melanoma on his back three years prior. The tumor had a Breslow thickness of 4.0 mm, and there were two positive sentinel nodes in both axillae. After surgical resection, disease progression occurred one year later, with increased size of lymph nodes in both axillae and retroperitoneal regions. There was also suspicion of a solitary lung metastasis in the left upper lobe. The patient was then referred to a tertiary center for escalation of treatment. Molecular testing revealed an NRAS tumor mutation but no BRAF tumor mutation.

The patient subsequently developed multiple organ failure affecting the lungs, gastrointestinal system, kidneys, and liver. Vascular thrombosis was confirmed by imaging (pulmonary embolism on computed tomography–thorax) and histopathological examination of the intestines.

Examination revealed bony hard swelling on the left mandible extending from the angle of the mouth to the tragus of the ear (anteroposteriorly) and from the zygoma to the submandibular region (superoinferiorly). Intraoral examination revealed a 3x2x1.5 cm fleshy, firm proliferative growth on the gingivobuccal complex of the left mandibular first premolar to first molar teeth region, with associated grade III mobility of the involved teeth.

The initial presentation of bony hard swelling on the left mandible prompted imaging. An orthopantomogram showed radiolucent lytic lesions, ill-defined margins with a ‘moth-eaten’ appearance suggestive of osteomyelitis affecting almost the entire mandible.

Orthopantomogram findings prompted further investigation with contrast-enhanced CT (CECT). CECT showed permeative lytic destruction of the left mandible with periosteal reaction, cortical breach in few areas and erosion of the mandibular alveolar arches extending up to the temporomandibular joint. Significant soft tissue component involving the masticatory space, invading into the muscles of mastication and floor of mouth, was also seen.

Axial bone window CT revealed predominantly lytic lesion with speculated and multilayered periosteal reaction. Coronal soft tissue window CT showed significant soft tissue component involving masticatory space, invading into the muscles of mastication and floor of mouth.

CT findings prompted a biopsy for histological examination. Histology revealed atypical epithelial cells proliferating in glandular, cribriform arrangement and isolated tumour cells within dense fibrous stroma invading into bone. These glandular structures were lined by cuboidal to columnar cells exhibiting papillary projections in few areas.

Histological findings led to a histopathological examination. Histopathology revealed marked nuclear pleomorphism, hyperchromatism, abundant mucous and clear cell differentiation, compatible with malignancy of glandular origin. Metastasis to jaws and oral soft tissues.

graph_530,True,"Case Report: A patient was diagnosed with stage IV (T3N0M1) lung adenocarcinoma via percutaneous biopsy. The patient had non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) driven by an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation, specifically a novel EGFR exon 20 insertion mutation D770_N771insGT and multiple brain metastases.

Initially, the patient was treated with first-line osimertinib. The patient briefly responded to this treatment. Due to disease progression, particularly in the brain metastases (BMs), a second-line treatment of osimertinib plus bevacizumab was initiated. This combination therapy resulted in prolonged disease control.

This case suggests that osimertinib in combination with bevacizumab may be an effective option for NSCLC patients with specific EGFRex20ins mutations and brain metastases. The VEGF pathway is a key mediator of cancer metastasis and resistance to EGFR TKIs, and the addition of anti-VEGF agents to EGFR TKIs provides an alternative treatment option for the clinical management of EGFR-mutant NSCLC.

On histologic examination, the tumour was restricted to neoplastic cells along pre-existing alveolar structures, lacking stromal, vascular, alveolar space, and pleural invasion. Papillary patterns were absent. Initially, the histopathological diagnosis was adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), but the total tumour diameter exceeded 3 cm. The final pathological diagnosis was lepidic adenocarcinoma lacking an invasive component and harbouring an EGFR exon 20 insertion V774_C775insHV mutation using next-generation sequencing (NGS).

This case reports a rare case of lepidic adenocarcinoma with a total tumour diameter of 6 cm and without an invasive component. Although EGFR mutations are oncogenic driver mutations, AISs have fewer EGFR mutations than invasive adenocarcinomas do. An adenocarcinoma that progresses to AIS, not stepwise progression, might have uncommon mutations and might be another type of adenocarcinoma. NGS could be useful for detecting uncommon genes that reveal the biological characteristics of AIS, and may contribute to the validation of next TNM classification.

graph_534,False,"An 82-year-old woman with no symptoms, no past history of lung disease, and a never-smoker was referred to the hospital due to an abnormal shadow detected on a chest roentgenogram during a routine medical check-up. Physical and laboratory test findings were normal.

Chest thin-slice computed tomography (TSCT) revealed a 6-cm-diameter pure ground-glass nodule (GGN) in the left lower lung.

Positron emission tomography/computed tomography showed that the mass had an unremarkable uptake of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose, with an early maximum standardised uptake value of 1.9.

The patient underwent a left lower lobe lobectomy via video-assisted thoracotomy with lymph node dissection. The operation time was 62 minutes, and the estimated blood loss was minimal.

Histologic examination of the tumor sections revealed a delicate lace-like appearance with no central scar or pleural depression. The tumor was restricted to neoplastic cells along pre-existing alveolar structures (lepidic growth), lacking stromal, vascular, and pleural invasion.

Pathology revealed Lepidic adenocarcinoma (LPA) with a total tumour diameter of 6 cm and which lacked an invasive tumour component. Intra-alveolar papillary or micropapillary growth was absent. Tumour cells were cuboidal with round nuclei, but some were taller with long oval nuclei. The tumour expressed a rare EGFR exon 20 insertion V774_C775insHV mutation.

Gross examination of the resected tumor revealed a 6 cm diameter mass in the dorsal region of the inferior lobe without central scarring or pleural indentation. The cut surface had a delicate lace-like appearance, suggesting well-preserved alveolar structures. Microscopically, neoplastic cells proliferated in a single layer along pre-existing alveolar structures (lepidic growth), lacking stromal invasion or papillary growth. Tumor cells were columnar with uniform-sized round to ovoid nuclei."
graph_535,False,"A patient presented with a 9 mm endometrial polyp with a feeder vessel. The patient's CA-125 level was 14 kIU/L, and the thyroid stimulating hormone serum concentration was 1.4 mIU/L. The patient underwent laparoscopy, which revealed a smooth and bulky left ovary and a small volume of green fluid in the rectovaginal pouch. During surgery, a 3 cm pink sea-anemone-like structure attached to the sigmoid peritoneum was found incidentally, adjacent to the left ovarian surface. The lesion was excised with a margin of peritoneum for histologic evaluation. The remainder of the pelvic and abdominal organs and peritoneum appeared normal. Hysteroscopy was unremarkable other than for a small endometrial polyp, which was excised. Microscopic evaluation of the peritoneal lesion showed well-defined papillary structures and benign papillary mesothelial proliferation consistent with Well-Differentiated Papillary Mesothelioma (WDPM). The pathology report of the peritoneal lesion showed no cytological atypia or infiltrative features. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated calretinin and CK 5/6 positivity within the mesothelial lining, consistent with well-differentiated papillary mesothelioma of the bowel peritoneum. The pathology report of the excised ovary demonstrated a struma ovarii consisting of benign thyroid tissue, mature fibroadipose connective tissue, and a variety of epithelia. The fallopian tube was normal. Cytological evaluation of the ascites found mesothelial cells and chronic inflammatory exudate. Ascitic microbiology was unremarkable. Retrospective review of pre-operative imaging was unable to visualize the WDPM. At the 6-week post-operative follow-up, the patient reported an uncomplicated recovery and resolution of the pelvic pain. Post-operative staging magnetic resonance imaging scan and transvaginal pelvic ultrasound scan showed no evidence of residual disease. Post-operative cross-sectional imaging did not detect any abnormality."
graph_535,True,"This is the first report of well-differentiated papillary mesothelioma (WDPM) found concurrently with struma ovarii. These rare tumors have no known association and are considered benign, though malignant transformation of WDPM has been described. After treatment of WDPM, follow-up surveillance has been suggested in the literature, though a method has not been described and an evidence base is lacking. Pre-operative imaging by computed tomography and ultrasound did not identify the WDPM, calling into question the role of imaging-based follow-up. Furthermore, malignant transformation has been reported only outside of the typical 5-year follow-up window. The authors of this case report suggest rationalization of follow-up of WDPM, acknowledging the risks and unknown harms of scheduled imaging follow-up.

graph_536,False,"A 30-year-old woman, 6-months pregnant, presented with a complaint of chronic headaches that were relieved by pain relievers. After the seventh month of pregnancy, she developed slowly progressing left hemiparesis accompanied by numbness in the left side of her body, and right eyelid ptosis. She also reported that her mouth felt tilted to the right side and was then referred to the hospital for delivery.

Postpartum, a head CT scan revealed multiple intracranial masses. A chest X-ray showed vague opacification on the left lung, suspected as a lung mass. The patient subsequently complained of progressing diplopia and diabetes insipidus.

An MRI showed multiple intracranial lesions with a morphological cerebrospinal fluid cleft sign in the concavity of the parietal area, indicative of dural metastasis, along with multiple lesions on the sellar and suprasellar regions. MR spectroscopy showed lipid peaks. Serum cancer antigen (CA) 125 was measured at 81.0 U/mL, and serum carcinoembryonic antigen was 41.06 ng/mL.

The patient underwent a craniotomy for tumor removal. The pathology report confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma in the right parietal area. A chest CT revealed a spiculated mass with cavitation sized 1.9 \u00d7 2.5 \u00d7 2.05 cm in the apicoposterior segment of the left lung. A previous chest X-ray showed a small opaque lesion superior to the left hilum. Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma with multiple intracranial metastases.

Further characterization included MR spectroscopy, which showed a prominence lipid peak, with low choline in the central lesion. Pathology anatomy from the intracranial mass showed a tumor mass consisting of round, oval-shaped cells that grow hyperplastic lesions and in groups, some of which are in the structure of the gland and were concluded as metastatic adenocarcinoma. Axial chest CT soft tissue window showed an enhancing lesion in the lung parenchyma, and the axial chest CT lung window showed a cavitating mass."
graph_536,True,"A patient presented with chronic headaches, progressing diplopia, and loss of sensation in the left side of the body. Examination revealed right cranial nerve III paresis, manifesting as a dropping right eyelid, and bitemporal hemianopsia.

Further investigation revealed diabetes insipidus and multiple intracranial masses, ultimately diagnosed as multiple intracranial metastases. The primary source was identified as lung adenocarcinoma. Serum cancer antigen (CA) 125 was elevated at 81.0 U/mL, and serum carcinoembryonic antigen was 41.06 ng/mL.

The patient underwent tumor removal. Pathology confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma, consistent with lung adenocarcinoma. Further imaging revealed multiple dural metastases and metastatic lesions to the sellar area. The differential diagnosis included multiple meningiomas, but the metastatic nature of the lesions was confirmed. The patient was also found to have breast cancer and lung cancer.

graph_537,False,"A 57-year-old Japanese woman with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 3 presented with ALK-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The diagnosis was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization in abdominal lymph node tissue (ALK iScore 3 by iAEP immunohistochemistry). A CT scan revealed a 70 mm primary tumor in the right lower lobe, several mediastinal and abdominal lymph node metastases, and pleural effusion. Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression was 90% using the 22C3 antibody.

The patient was initiated on alectinib. After 4 months of treatment, she achieved a partial response, and her ECOG-PS improved to 1.

However, a CT scan 8 months after starting alectinib revealed growth of the primary tumor and mediastinal lymph node, indicating disease progression.

Alectinib was discontinued, and second-line treatment with cisplatin (75 mg/m2, day 1, every 3 weeks) and pemetrexed (500 mg/m2, day 1, every 3 weeks) was initiated. After two cycles, a partial response was observed, evaluated by thorax-pelvis CT scan every 2 months. Upon completion of four cycles of cisplatin and pemetrexed, rapid progression occurred.

The patient experienced growth of the primary sites and abdominal lymph node, an increase in pleural effusion, and the emergence of pleural dissemination on CT scan. Her condition weakened, with an ECOG-PS of 3 due to anorexia, dyspnea, dysphagia, and cachexia. Pleural effusion was negative for malignancy. The patient underwent a blood transfusion for grade 3 anemia (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version (CTCAE) version 4.0) due to chronic disorder."
graph_537,True,"A patient presented with lung adenocarcinoma, specifically ALK rearrangement non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), later confirmed as ALK-positive NSCLC. Initially, the patient experienced tumor shrinkage in response to treatment. However, the disease subsequently exhibited rapid progression. The patient developed symptoms including anorexia, dyspnea, dysphagia, cachexia, and diarrhea. Clinical findings included pleural effusion, grade 3 anemia, and an abdominal metastatic lymph node. The patient also reported dysgeusia. The progression of the ALK-positive NSCLC was associated with the development of secondary mutations of ALK, including ALK mutations. Genetic testing likely ruled out EGFR and KRAS mutations, and potentially investigated insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1R) and T790M. The emergence of secondary ALK mutations likely contributed to the rapid progression and resistance to initial therapies. The patient's condition deteriorated, marked by the development of malignancy and associated symptoms.

She reported no chest pain or fevers, and no prior history of venous thromboembolism. She was a never-cigarette smoker and had a prior diagnosis of asthma, manifesting as intermittent wheeze and dyspnoea. On examination, she had decreased air entry at the left upper zone. Admission blood tests showed normal complete blood count, electrolytes, liver function, and inflammatory markers.

Her vital signs revealed sinus tachycardia of 120 beats/min, saturating at 98% on room air and was afebrile. Chest X-ray showed left upper lobe consolidation. CT pulmonary angiogram demonstrated a 35x25mm tumour mass arising from the distal left main bronchus, invading into the mediastinum and causing complete collapse of the left upper lobe. Attenuated vasculature of the hyperexpanded left lower lobe, multiple left-sided subpleural blebs and a left small loculated medial pneumothorax were also observed.

Further findings included thickening and irregularity of the left visceral pleura, normal right lung, and no pulmonary embolism. Bronchoscopy revealed a large globular mass at the distal left main bronchus, completely occluding the lumen. Biopsy of the lesion showed typical pulmonary carcinoid with a proliferation index (Ki-67)<2%.

An endobronchial view showed a large obstructive globular mass arising from the distal left main bronchus. Therapeutic debulking bronchoscopy with re-expansion of the left lower lobe was performed during the pregnancy. Repeat inspection bronchoscopy at 22 weeks’ gestation showed stable intraluminal disease.

A Gallium-68 DOTATATE PET scan was delayed until postdelivery.

The patient had an uncomplicated induced vaginal delivery at 38 weeks’ gestation and gave birth to a healthy baby boy.

Postdelivery, a Gallium-68 DOTATATE PET scan showed an intensely avid left upper lobe mass with no nodal or metastatic disease.

The patient underwent a left upper lobe sleeve lobectomy.

Histology confirmed typical carcinoid tumor (TC), with a mitotic rate of less than 2/2 mm2 and no evidence of necrosis. Macroscopic findings from the upper lobe showed multiple pleural blebs, corresponding to the CT findings. Resected tumour with trabecular and organoid growth pattern and uniform tissue cytomorphology. Serial sections of the left upper lobe from superior to inferior. No lymph node involvement on sampling. Cut sections 13–16 show a rounded, firm, tan tumour measuring 20x20x20 mm.

graph_539,True,"The patient discontinued crizotinib after approximately 4 months due to crizotinib-associated hepatotoxicity. Twenty-five days later, when transaminases had normalized, crizotinib was resumed. However, the patient's liver enzymes rapidly increased again, and crizotinib was discontinued. After 6 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy, lorlatinib was initiated. Hepatotoxicity did not recur with lorlatinib, a next-generation ALK inhibitor, but grade 4 hypertriglyceridemia and acute pancreatitis were induced by lorlatinib after 4 months. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of acute pancreatitis with lorlatinib. Additionally, stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) was performed for residual small primary lesions in the lung without stopping lorlatinib. Given the rarity of radiation pneumonitis, especially with the relatively small fields treated by SBRT, we suspect that lorlatinib enhanced the pulmonary toxicity. Physicians should be aware that ALK inhibitors, such as lorlatinib and crizotinib, have potentially lethal side effects.

A Tru-Cut biopsy from the mass in the upper lobe of the right lung revealed SRC carcinoma with an inversion of the EML4-ALK gene detected by immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization. The patient was diagnosed with metastatic ALK-rearranged NSCLC.

In November 2016, crizotinib (250 mg twice daily) was initiated as the first-line treatment. Follow-up PET after 3 months showed the size and metabolic activity of the primary lesion and lymph nodes remarkably decreased. However, after 3 months of crizotinib treatment, the patient developed toxic hepatitis. Following this adverse reaction, the patient received lorlatinib after crizotinib and platinum-doublet chemotherapy. After 4 months of lorlatinib, the patient developed acute pancreatitis due to hypertriglyceridemia."

She was diagnosed with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma with negative EGFR/ALK/ROS1 mutations. The patient was subsequently treated with anti-programmed cell death-1 (anti-PD-1) therapy.

In December 2017, the patient received 6 cycles of SHR-1210 combined with pemetrexed and carboplatin, followed by 29 cycles of SHR-1210 in combination with pemetrexed. By February 2018, after two cycles of treatment (6 weeks), lung cancer was effectively controlled, with efficacy evaluation showing stable disease.

She was medicated with 25 mcg Levothyroxine daily since July 1, 2019. Her history included smoking one cigarette per day for 7 years, but she quit 24 years prior. Her family history was notable for ovarian cancer in her mother at age 75 and colorectal cancer in her uncle at age 67.

During the study, a PanTum Detect blood test revealed an elevated combined PanTum score of 270 (Apo10 score: 144, TKTL1 score: 126). Tumor markers CEA, CA 19-9, CA 125, CA 15-3, AFP, beta HCG, and CRP were not elevated. Based on these findings, PET/CT imaging analysis was recommended.

FDG-PET/CT imaging revealed a 16 mm x 12 mm mass in the right upper lobe with increased focal 18F-FDG uptake (SUVmax 6.3) adjacent to the hilus. A follow-up PET/CT scan showed bilateral diffuse enhancement with mild focal emphasis cranially of the hilus (left SUVmax 5.8 > right SUVmax 4.8). Radiological findings revealed suspicion of lung carcinoma in the right upper lobe parahilar without pathologic lymph nodes. The 16 mm x 12 mm mass in the right upper lobe persisted.

A biopsy of the right upper lobe parahilar mass confirmed malignant lung carcinoma. The patient underwent surgical resection of the right upper lobe mass.

graph_542,True,"Case series: Immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced transverse myelitis

Increasing implementation of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has raised awareness of their complications in the form of immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Transverse myelitis following ICIs is a rare but serious neurologic irAE. This case series describes four patients across three tertiary centers in Australia with ICI-induced transverse myelitis.

Three patients had a diagnosis of stage III–IV melanoma treated with nivolumab, and one patient had stage IV non-small cell lung cancer treated with pembrolizumab. All patients had longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) spine, and clinical presentation was accompanied by inflammatory cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings. Half of the cohort had received spinal radiotherapy, with the areas of transverse myelitis extending beyond the level of previous radiation field. Inflammatory changes on neuroimaging did not extend to the brain parenchyma or caudal nerve roots, except for one case involving the conus medullaris.

All patients received high-dose glucocorticoids as first-line therapy; however, the majority relapsed or had a refractory state (3/4) despite this, requiring escalation of their immunomodulation, with either induction intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) or plasmapheresis. Patients who relapsed had a poorer outcome with more severe disability and reduced functional independence following resolution of their myelitis. Two patients had no progression of their malignancy, and two patients had malignancy progression. Of the three patients who survived, two had resolution of their neurological symptoms, and one remained symptomatic.

The authors propose that prompt intensive immunomodulation is favored for patients with ICI-transverse myelitis in an attempt to reduce associated significant morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, there is a significant risk of relapse following cessation of immunomodulatory therapy. They suggest one treatment approach of IVMP and induction IVIg for all patients presenting with ICI-induced transverse myelitis based on such findings.

graph_543,False,"A 76-year-old male was diagnosed in 2021 with stage IV adenocarcinoma (cT2bN2M1b) without targetable genomic alterations (EGFR, ALK, ROS1). The initial diagnosis was based on a right abdominal muscle surgical resection, a chest CT showing a tumor shadow in the right lower lobe of the lung and multiple swollen lymph nodes in the mediastinum, and an 18F-FDG PET/CT revealing multiple 18F-FDG uptake in the right abdominal muscle, L4, and right iliac bone. Blood tests were normal, and the patient's ECOG score was 1.

The patient was enrolled in the IMpower 132 clinical study and received 6 cycles of carboplatin, pemetrexed, and atezolizumab (every 3 weeks). A CT scan after these 6 cycles revealed right lower pulmonary lesions and swollen lymph nodes, but also indicated a partial response of the lesions in the right lower lobe and swollen lymph nodes.

Subsequently, the patient underwent 36 cycles of maintenance therapy with pemetrexed and atezolizumab.

During maintenance therapy, the patient developed thrombocytopenia (platelet level: 91 x 10^3/uL) with normal hemoglobin and normal white cell counts. He was initially treated with interleukin-11 (IL-11) for 2 weeks to enhance the proliferation of megalokaryocytes. However, the platelet count slightly declined, and no autoimmune or coagulation disorders were displayed after IL-11 therapy. Atezolizumab-induced immune thrombocytopenia was suspected, and the patient was treated with prednisone (0.5mg/kg) for 2 weeks. The thrombocytopenia worsened, with a sudden decrease in platelet level to 35 x 10^3/uL. Pemetrexed and atezolizumab were discontinued. A bone marrow biopsy showed no morphological abnormalities, phagocytosis, or malignant invasion. Antinuclear antibodies and other laboratory tests were negative, but antiphospholipid and antiplatelet antibodies were abnormal, leading to a diagnosis of atezolizumab-induced immune thrombocytopenia.

The patient was then treated with a high-dose steroid for 6 consecutive days and recombinant human thrombopoietin (TPO). Despite four platelet transfusions, mycophenolate mofetil, and IVIG infusion, the platelet count remained low at 23 x 10^3/uL, with a recorded lowest level of 20 x 10^3/uL. Serum IL-6 level was significantly increased. Tocilizumab (400 mg), an IL-6 receptor antagonist, was added to the treatment regimen in addition to mycophenolate mofetil.

One week after tocilizumab treatment, the platelet counts started to increase and reached the normal range (100 to 300 x 10^3/uL)."

The largest nodule was clinically diagnosed as early-stage lung cancer, and thoracoscopic segmentectomy was scheduled. The patient underwent general anesthesia induced with double-lumen intubation in preparation for thoracoscopic segmentectomy. Aerosolized ICG (3.75 mg/ml) was inhaled into the operative lung after single-lung ventilation. Ventilator settings were: volume-controlled mode, tidal volume 450-500 ml, 12 respirations per minute, inspiratory-to-expiratory ratio 1:2. ICG inhalation lasted 5 min. Fluorescence imaging of the lung tissue was not obvious during surgery. The horizontal fissure and the vein in the anterior segment were dissected and cut with endoscopic staplers (EndoGIA).

graph_544,True,"Intraoperative tracheobronchial injury is a rare but serious complication in lung and esophageal surgery that requires early and skilled repair [1–7]. The main cause of intraoperative tracheobronchial injury is anatomical errors, which may include accidental tracheobronchial transection caused by incorrect identification of anatomical structures and accidental bronchial membrane injury caused by dissection of adjacent bronchial structures. Intraoperative tracheobronchial injuries can be recognized directly by the surgeon or by means of a water submersion test and can be repaired by complete anatomic restoration of the lesion with interrupted or running resorbable sutures1 or coverage of the lesion with an intercostal muscle flap [8]. If tracheobronchial injury is not recognized during surgery, it may cause infection, hemoptysis, dyspnea, etc. Injuries in the tracheobronchial tree might occur in different ways. Erroneous transections to the bronchi could lead to additional major surgeries and potentially severe complications [1]. Amit Borah et al. reported a case in which the superior segment bronchus of the right lower lobe was erroneously clipped by a surgical clip during basal segmental resection [12]. Dissection of adjacent bronchial structures may cause bronchial membrane injury, especially during the process of lymph node dissection. Kawamura et al. reported a case in which the membranous portion of the intermediate bronchus was injured approximately 5 mm in length while dissecting subcarinal lymph nodes [14]. Even though the fistula was closed by knotted suture using 4 − 0 polydioxanone and covered with a pericardial fat pad, postoperative bronchoscopy revealed a slit-like bronchopleural fistula at the intermediate bronchus.

The patient was a 58-year-old woman who presented with a chief complaint of cough for 3 months. Pathology of this patient suggested that the nodule was a minimally invasive adenocarcinoma with no metastasis to the lymph nodes.

A subsequent CT scan revealed a 14 x 10 mm pure ground-glass nodule in the apical segmental (S1) bronchus of the right upper lobe. Further investigation with 3D CT, intraoperative scanning, and tracheoscopy revealed an apical (S1) and posterior segmental (S2) bronchus originating directly from the main trachea/right wall of the trachea, and the pulmonary vein of the apical segmental (V1) bronchus running dorsal to the pulmonary artery. Bronchus anatomy was confirmed by tracheoscopy, revealing a tracheal bronchus (TB) on computed tomography imaging and by tracheoscopy. The patient was asymptomatic according to normal physical examination and blood test analysis. No distant metastases were detected by bone radioisotopic scanning.

Based on these findings, the patient was scheduled for right apical segmentectomy with mediastinal lymph node sampling for suspected adenocarcinoma. During the procedure, the artery of the apical segment (A1) was ligated and cut, and the apical segmental bronchus (B1) was isolated and cut. The pulmonary vein (V1) was ligated and cut at the rear of the apical segmental bronchus. Lymph nodes around the TB were resected, and right apical segmentectomy was completed using end staplers. Pathological diagnosis confirmed minimally invasive adenocarcinoma with negative margins and no evidence of lymph node metastasis. The postoperative course was uneventful.

The patient recovered well postoperatively and was discharged 5 days post-operation."
graph_547,True,"A 59-year-old man with a 10-year history of coronary heart disease (with one stent implanted in the circumflex) was admitted to the clinic in March 2022. He presented with a persistent cough producing blood-streaked sputum for 6 months, which had worsened over the last 2 months. He had stable vital signs, no chest heartburn or pain, and no dizziness or palpitations (ECOG score: 1). Cardiac ultrasound indicated that cardiac function was lower than normal. He had no prior history of hypertension or diabetes mellitus. A CT scan with chest contrast revealed a right hilar mass enveloping the right pulmonary artery, and the right hilar lymph node was about 2.3 cm. A pathological tissue biopsy performed by tracheoscopy led to a diagnosis of stage IIIB squamous carcinoma of the right lung (pT4N2M0). A craniocerebral MRI enhancement scan and abdominal CT non-contrast scan did not reveal metastases. Cardiac ultrasound showed a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 50%. Initial electrocardiogram (ECG), cardiac enzymes, and liver and kidney functions were normal.

The patient was treated with a programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitor, tislelizumab, in combination with nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin. After one cycle of this combination therapy, the patient developed cardiotoxicity. Tislelizumab was discontinued and replaced with sugemalimab (PD-L1 inhibitor), while nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin were continued. After four cycles of immunotherapy with sugemalimab, a significant benefit was observed, and no further cardiotoxicity occurred. This case demonstrates that myocardial damage induced by tislelizumab can be improved after switching to sugemalimab and that antitumor immunotherapy is effective.

graph_548,True,"A patient with lung adenocarcinoma received adjuvant atezolizumab therapy, followed by surgery and chemotherapy. Later, the patient developed liver and brain metastases during adjuvant atezolizumab therapy. A craniotomy was performed to resect a brain metastasis, which was pathologically diagnosed as small cell lung cancer (SCLC). He subsequently received platinum‐based chemotherapy with durvalumab, resulting in sustained regression of the liver metastases. This case demonstrates a metastatic brain tumor-acquired resistance to atezolizumab through histologic transformation from adenocarcinoma to SCLC. This case illustrates SCLC transformation as acquired resistance to atezolizumab, with the primary lung tumor and metastatic brain tumor, both surgically resected, histologically confirmed as adenocarcinoma and SCLC, respectively. Therefore, rebiopsy is needed if recurrent disease appears during immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment in patients with non‐small cell lung cancer.

graph_548,False,"A 67-year-old man with a 47-pack-year smoking history was diagnosed with primary lung adenocarcinoma (pT1cN2M0 Stage IIIA) after a right upper lobectomy in March 2022. His PD-L1 tumor proportion score was 1%–24%, and no druggable driver oncogenes were identified. Following four cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin and vinorelbine, he received 15 cycles of atezolizumab maintenance therapy until June 2023. In July 2023, he was admitted to the hospital with right homonymous hemianopsia and hemiplegia. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a metastatic lesion in the occipital lobe. The metastatic lesion in the occipital lobe was resected via craniotomy and subsequently irradiated. The tumor was diagnosed as small cell lung cancer (SCLC) with no adenocarcinoma components. Computed tomography revealed multiple liver metastases. Serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was elevated due to metastases but rapidly decreased after brain tumor resection by craniotomy. He was treated with four cycles of durvalumab combined with cisplatin and etoposide, followed by maintenance therapy with durvalumab. Sustained tumor regression was observed, with a 13-month progression-free survival (PFS) as of September 2024."
graph_549,True,"# Primary pulmonary lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma misdiagnosed as lung squamous cell carcinoma: A case report

A 44-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital after experiencing dull pain in her left chest for one month, starting in February 2023. She reported no other symptoms such as chest tightness or breathing difficulties at that time and did not seek medical attention.

The patient had a history of rheumatoid arthritis for over seven years, which was well-managed with oral medication.

Initial tumor marker analysis revealed the following: α-fetoprotein 3.86 ng/mL; carcinoembryonic antigen 0.68 ng/mL; carbohydrate antigen (CA)199 5.20 U/mL; CA125 79.70 U/mL; CA153 27.90 U/mL.

Computed tomography (CT) revealed a mass shadow in the anterior basal segment of the left lower lobe. A subsequent needle biopsy suggested squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).

Based on the biopsy results, the patient underwent radical tumor resection in the lower left lobe of the lung. However, postoperative pathological examination indicated lymphoepithelial carcinoma. Further testing confirmed the presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) encoded small RNA.

Following surgery, the patient was scheduled to receive four cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy, using the paclitaxel + carboplatin regimen. However, the patient refused further treatment.

The patient's case highlights the diagnostic challenges associated with primary pulmonary lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma (PPLELC), a rare subtype of lung SCC closely associated with EBV infection, and prone to misdiagnosis.

graph_549,False,"In February 2023, a patient presented with dull pain in the left chest. The patient had a history of rheumatoid arthritis for over 7 years, which was effectively managed with stable control through oral medication. The patient's performance status score was 1, and there was no peripheral lymphadenopathy.

Tumor marker analysis revealed the following values: α-fetoprotein 3.86 ng/mL; carcinoembryonic antigen 0.68 ng/mL; carbohydrate antigen (CA)199 5.20 U/mL; CA125 79.70 U/mL; CA153 27.90 U/mL.

A CT scan showed a 3.3 cm x 3.6 cm x 3.5 cm lobulated mass in the anterior basal segment of the left lower lobe, with adjacent pleural thickening and adhesion, indicating the possibility of a neoplasm. MRI showed no tumors detected. CT images of the chest showed the tumor size was approximately 3.3 cm.

On March 10, 2023, the patient underwent a needle biopsy. The pathological diagnosis indicated squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), with CD56(-), cytokeratin (CK)8/18(+), chromogranin A (CgA)(-), Ki-67 (+, 30%), P40(+), synaptophysin (Syn)(-), and thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1)(-) on immunohistochemistry.

The patient subsequently underwent radical lung cancer surgery. Postoperative pathology suggested no lymph node metastasis. The findings showed positivity for EBV encoded small RNA (EBER), CK5/6, CK8/18, Ki-67 (60%), and P40, while TTF-1 was negative, leading to a diagnosis of primary pulmonary lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma (PPLELC). The patient was diagnosed with PPLELC (pT2aN0)."
