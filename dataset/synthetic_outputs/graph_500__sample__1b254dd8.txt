A 74-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia presented with a three-month history of dizziness, unsteady gait, and difficulty in swallowing food and water, which had been worsening over the preceding month. On admission, he exhibited severe ataxia, downbeat and horizontal nystagmus in all directions of gaze, dysarthria, dysphagia, loss of tendon reflexes, and dysuria. Videoendoscopic examination of swallowing showed a pooling of saliva in the pyriform fossae and a diminished cough reflex. Thickened water was not cleared from the hypopharynx by swallowing several times, and part of it was aspirated.

Blood examinations showed no abnormalities, including thyroid function and vitamin B1, vitamin B12, and folic acid levels. The antinuclear antibody titer was 1:80, and anti-GAD, anti-GM1, anti-GQ1b, anti-SS-A, anti-SS-B, and anti-AChR antibodies were negative. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination showed mild pleocytosis (6 cells/\u00b5L) (100% mononuclear cells), elevated protein levels (65.8 mg/dL), and a normal IgG index. Analysis of the CSF showed no infectious or malignant etiologies. MRI of the head was unremarkable. (123I) N-isopropyl-p-iodoamphetamine (IMP) brain perfusion SPECT did not show perfusion abnormalities.

Based on these findings, subacute autoimmune-mediated cerebellitis with brainstem involvement was suspected. The patient was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) at a dose of 400 mg/kg for five days, but there was no improvement in the neurological symptoms. Two days after IVIG therapy, two courses of high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone, followed by oral prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day), were administered.

Further investigation via immunoblotting of serum was positive (+++) for anti-amphiphysin antibodies and positive (+) for anti-SRY-box transcription factor 1 (SOX1) antibody. Other antibodies associated with paraneoplastic neurological syndromes were negative. This led to a final diagnosis of non-stiff anti-amphiphysin syndrome with coexistence of anti-SOX1.
