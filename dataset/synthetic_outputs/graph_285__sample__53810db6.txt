A 69-year-old male with a history of myasthenia gravis diagnosed in 1979 and on methotrexate for approximately 20 years, rheumatic fever, and a history of testicular lymphoma in 1981 status-post left orchiectomy without chemotherapy or radiation, presented to his primary care physician with two months of abdominal swelling with early satiety. Family history includes unknown etiology of liver disease in his mother and sister from which the latter died from at age 52. He denied alcohol use and had no prior diagnosis of liver disease. Bedside ultrasonography showed large ascites and liver nodularity. Liver enzymes, international normalized ratio (INR), and albumin were normal. Formal ultrasound with Doppler showed a shrunken liver with large ascites concerning for decompensating cirrhosis. No evidence of thrombosis or venous outflow obstruction was found. The patient was referred to gastroenterology for new-onset ascites with concern for cirrhosis. Methotrexate was stopped to prevent further hepatic injury. Ultrasound-guided paracentesis was performed and 8100 mL of serous fluid was obtained with SAAG of 1.3 and protein of 3.7 g/dL. Initial cytology did not reveal malignancy. Additional labs for Wilsonâ€™s disease, hemochromatosis, hepatitis A, B, C, and autoimmune hepatitis were negative. An echocardiogram revealed normal systolic function and no valvular pathology.
