A 71-year-old man diagnosed with advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma and pleura and lymph node metastasis received carboplatin, paclitaxel, bevacizumab and atezolizumab every 3 weeks as first-line chemotherapy for 4 months. Due to the advanced nature of his cancer, he progressed to second-line treatment with docetaxel and ramucirumab. Following chemotherapy, the patient had three episodes of ileocecal diverticulitis, all of which were treated conservatively with antimicrobials and fasting therapy. The patient then presented with a fourth diverticulitis episode, accompanied by fever and abdominal pain that had worsened over 5 days. Physical examination revealed tenderness and rigidity throughout the abdomen. Body temperature was 37.7\u00b0C. Laboratory data indicated inflammation, with a WBC count of 21400/\u03bcL and a CRP level of 23.8 mg/dL. Abdominal CT imaging showed ascites and intra-abdominal free air around the right-side colon. The patient underwent emergency laparotomy with a midline incision. Surveying the small bowel revealed that ileal perforation occurred only a few centimeters proximal to the ileocolic valve. The patient underwent ileocecal resection, ileostomy and a colonic mucous fistula. Surgically resected specimen macroscopic findings indicated multiple ileal diverticula, with one perforated on the mesenteric border. Histopathology revealed a pseudodiverticulum at the perforation site, with mucosal depression through the muscularis propria and inflammatory cell infiltration with abscess formation penetrating the serous surface. Postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged 24 days after surgery. The patient opted for chemotherapy again and died about 6 months after the surgery.

A separate case involved a 49-year-old male with appendicitis who underwent ileocecal resection.

Another patient with appendectomy, inguinal hernia, and heart failure taking various medications for sigmoid diverticulitis underwent right hemicolectomy.

A 30-year-old male underwent segmental ileal resection for diverticulitis.

A 75-year-old male with penetration of terminal ileum underwent right hemicolectomy for diverticulitis.

Finally, a 65-year-old male with hypertension and angina underwent elective surgery for sigmoid diverticulitis.
