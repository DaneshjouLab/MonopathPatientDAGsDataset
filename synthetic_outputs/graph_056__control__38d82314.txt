Pulmonary tumor thrombotic microangiopathy (PTTM) is a lung complication associated with cancer. Specifically, it can occur in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Early chemotherapy initiation is important in managing disease activity. However, patients may experience recurrence despite multiple chemotherapy regimens. Monitoring blood coagulation status and performing echocardiography are crucial for early clinical diagnosis and monitoring disease progression.

Pulmonary tumor thrombotic microangiopathy (PTTM) is a rare lung complication of cancer, characterized by pulmonary hypertension and embolization of tumor cells. It is most frequently associated with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, but has also been reported in gastric cancer, and breast and lung cancers. PTTM is often associated with rapid progression and a lack of specific clinical findings.
