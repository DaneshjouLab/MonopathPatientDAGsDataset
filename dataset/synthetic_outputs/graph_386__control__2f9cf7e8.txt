In August 2021, after one year of anti-PD1 treatment, the patient complained of alternating diarrhea and constipation. In December 2021 (3 months after initiation of atezolizumab), she developed progressively worsening constipation and became resistant to prokinetics. The patient was hospitalized because of severe constipation, daily postprandial vomiting, and weight loss. An abdominal CT scan showed no mechanical occlusion and suggested paralytic ileus. The diagnosis of ICI-related intestinal pseudo-occlusion was suspected. An upper digestive tract fibroscopy revealed simple gastritis. Diagnostic work-up was then completed by esophageal manometry (test analyzing esophageal pressures showing type 3 achalasia) and nociceptive laser-evoked potentials (test looking for damage to small myelinated type A delta or unmyelinated type C fibers finding in our case an alteration of A delta fiber transmission from foot stimulation and demonstrating the presence of a small fiber neuropathy). The diagnosis of immune-related enteric neuropathy was confirmed by the results of the intestinal biopsies (Fig. 2), showing lymphocytic, CD8+ predominant infiltrates in the myenteric plexus. A transient clinical improvement was observed (intestinal transit recovery, resumption of partial oral feeding), with transient recovery of intestinal transit with alternate bowel occlusion. One month later, he was hospitalized for an occlusive syndrome associated with acute urine retention. The patient presented several immune-related grade 2 toxicities: thyroiditis, pruritus, and pituitary insufficiency. In addition, she had (as a complication of her prolonged fasting) acute lithiasic pancreatitis that required cholecystectomy. No anti-neoplastic therapy was resumed despite metastatic progression occurring in January 2022, because of iterative sepsis and persistent CIPO, leading to the patientâ€™s death in September 2022.
